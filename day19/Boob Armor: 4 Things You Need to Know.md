00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.600
So you’re designing a female character or
characters who need some armour, and not the

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:06.480
ceremonial stuff either, stuff they can actually
fight in.

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:10.080
That being the case, you probably know to
avoid all the obvious armour pitfalls:

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:14.320
armour that protects non-vital areas but leaves
your gut or chest exposed, (not to mention

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:16.560
leaving you exposed to the weather if you’re
on location)

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:19.440
metal on bare skin in general,
battle stilettos,

00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:22.080
combat wedges
but you’re wondering what to do about the

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:23.120
boob situation.

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:24.080
All right let’s do this.

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:28.400
Four considerations to take into account when
designing torso armour for ladies, and at

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:31.840
the end of the video, a lightning round where
I give you my actual opinion.

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:33.760
I mean, more so than the rest of this video.

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:37.440
I’m Jill Bearup, I make videos about fights
in media, off we go.

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:38.240
1.

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:40.160
You don’t need boob plate.

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:44.880
a) There is no inherent mechanical advantage
to armour shaped like two separate breasts.

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:49.200
The disadvantages range from very minor to...more
of an issue, but we’ll get into those, and

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:51.040
how to mitigate them, a bit later on.

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:55.760
b) If we’re talking about medieval plate,
or medieval plate-inspired stuff, then basically

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:59.280
any size of breasts can be accommodated within
a smoothly curved cuirass.

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:03.520
Both because gambesons tend to smooth out
the curve a bit, and also because medieval

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:07.920
armour requires a fair amount of extra space
in the chest cavity regardless, because people

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:08.720
need to breathe.

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:13.120
So something like this, or maybe this, could
be very easily altered to accommodate the

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:14.080
female form.

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:16.880
And it really wouldn’t look that different
on the outside at all.

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:19.680
I mean Stormtroopers also look&nbsp;
basically indistinguishable,&nbsp;

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:22.000
regardless of breast or chest size, which

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.520
is important if you’re a Stormtrooper, though
I’m really not sure whether only the male

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:27.040
Stormtroopers get the codpiece.

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:31.600
Apparently, Elizabeth the First historically
wore a breastplate though not full armour,

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:33.840
but this is a really nice option.

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:37.520
If the “same armour design as the men”
option appeals, but you want to signal that

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:41.440
the character is a woman without kitting her
out with metal boobs, then there are some

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:43.280
nice skirt or tunic options.

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:47.040
Long skirts may hamper mobility a bit, but
look at this guy.

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:48.240
Is he not stylish?

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:51.920
c) Close fitting body armour doesn’t need
cleavage.

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:55.840
If you look at police or military flak jackets,
you’ll note that they’re not exactly showing

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:56.720
off the goods.

00:01:56.720 --> 00:02:01.360
But underneath all of those pockets they are
pretty precisely tailored to fit the wearer.

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:06.240
And for women they do this by taking bust,
underbust, waist and length measurements,

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:08.400
as well as possibly shoulder&nbsp;
to shoulder measurements&nbsp;

00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:09.200
in some cases.

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:14.480
Protective gear for motorbikes is more about
tough fabric with extra plates for impact

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:17.040
protection, but even then&nbsp;
it’s hardly cleavage-tastic.

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:20.640
I suppose that would be an active disadvantage
for impact protection, you want something

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:23.040
that will spread the force over the widest
possible area.

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:25.520
And
d) There are so many options which aren’t

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:26.320
plate armour.

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:29.760
We’re not really going to be talking about
them in depth today, but...so many.

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:34.640
Depending on who, where, and when your female
character is, as well as what she’s doing,

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:39.680
why, and what materials are available, you
have so many things that you can either use

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:42.320
wholesale or use as inspiration.

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:43.360
Like mail.

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:45.360
I mean historically this&nbsp;
was worn over a gambeson...

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:46.880
But never mind.

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:47.760
Or scale.

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:51.840
Or lamellar, like this one which has slits
up the back for ease of movement and presumably

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:52.720
also horseriding.

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:53.520
Or brigandine!

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:57.280
And the nice thing about these is that even
though they’re not very cleavage-y, a lot

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:01.520
of them do belt in at the natural waist so
that you can distribute some of the weight

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:04.880
onto your hips and not have it just hanging
off the shoulders, so you can still get that

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:07.440
kind of female shape without going nuts.

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:11.760
OK but maybe you’re really heck-bent on
breastplate and plate armour and you really

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:13.760
like armour that looks obviously female.

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:14.720
Second point to consider:

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:16.880
Divots are a disadvantage.

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:19.920
a) Convex shaping is the optimal way to make
plate.

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:23.760
Convex shapes are more likely to have weapons
glance off, which is why a lot of medieval

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:27.680
examples of plate armour have that ridge in
the middle as the highest point, but also

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:31.600
mechanically speaking domes and convex shapes
are more difficult to crush, and so they will

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:33.840
be maximally protective when you take a hit.

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:37.360
Because of this, any indent will be a weak
point mechanically.

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:40.720
And
b) if you add in extra thickness between the

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:44.960
breasts to compensate for the weak point you
are raising your centre of mass a little bit.

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:46.880
Which again is slightly disadvantageous.

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:51.760
And this goes double if your breastplate design
is a regular slightly curved plate with some

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:53.440
boobs stapled over the top.

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:56.880
Some things which people already rushing to
the comments section with at this point: but

00:03:56.880 --> 00:03:57.920
Jill, how can you say that?

00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:00.960
People did disadvantageous things with armour
all the time!

00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:02.720
First, look at muscle cuirasses!

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:05.680
Second, look how medieval armour often had
a wasp waist!

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:07.280
And third: codpieces!

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:08.160
Need I say more?

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:09.920
So let's talk about all of those, because...it’s&nbsp;

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:11.920
not even a tangent, they’re&nbsp;
useful for illustrative

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:12.400
purposes.

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:15.840
First I invite you to look at the depth of
the indent on the muscle cuirasses.

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:19.040
Even in the more extreme examples, it’s
not that deep.

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:22.640
Is this shape less efficient inherently than
a convex plate?

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:22.960
Yeah.

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:23.440
By a lot?

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:24.320
Nah.

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:28.480
So sure, muscle cuirasses with a bunch of
abs and pecs aren’t the absolute most efficient

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:32.960
thing, but they did look great, and they were
pretty likely to protect you against anything

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:34.320
you were likely to come across.

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:36.400
So: same principle with your lady armour.

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:38.640
Is it marginally less efficient to have a&nbsp;

00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:41.120
boob shelf with a slightly&nbsp;
steeper curve underneath

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:42.640
to emphasise the bust?

00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:43.280
Yes.

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:45.680
Might some characters choose that option anyway?

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:50.080
I would say yeah probably, because it’s
not going to make that much of a difference.

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:54.560
A very pragmatic character, or one who does
not wish her sex to be known on the battlefield,

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:59.040
or one who would really like you to stop looking
at her boobs please , or one who is actually

00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:03.680
just using repurposed men’s armour, hi Eowyn,
probably wouldn’t have it, but a character

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:09.040
who likes to look good may well go for this
option, albeit not as suctioned on as it looks

00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:10.560
in computer games.

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:12.320
It’s a little more tricky with cleavage
divots.

00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:16.880
Now again, if it’s fairly small, you can
probably crack on if aesthetics are a priority.

00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:19.440
But I would refrain from having a really big
indent.

00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:23.360
Or at least making like Wonder Woman and adding
some extra thickness over the top so the indent

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:24.720
is less steep and deep.

00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:28.080
Something like this will raise the centre
of mass a bit, but not by very much.

00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:31.600
And if it’s more illusory thickness, like
there’s actually more of a shelf behind

00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:35.360
there than two separate breast holes, then
that will also make it easier to wear.

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:38.800
Two plate plate has its own disadvantages,
but hold that thought for point 3.

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:42.800
As for: why does medieval armour go in and
have a wasp waist with a join there then Jill?

00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:43.520
Glad you asked.

00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:48.160
I mean, aesthetics is one reason, aesthetics
are important, but there are two other really

00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:49.440
quite important reasons.

00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:53.200
First because armour is heavy, and one of
the ways they distribute the weight evenly

00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:57.840
so you can move around freely in it is by
taking some of the weight off the shoulders

00:05:57.840 --> 00:06:02.400
and putting it on the hips, and to do this,
you need armour that comes in to the natural

00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:05.440
waist, so that it can shape itself over your
hips and distribute the weight there.

00:06:05.440 --> 00:06:09.280
The chest, as I mentioned earlier, has to
be larger than the natural chest otherwise

00:06:09.280 --> 00:06:14.160
the knight will not be able to breathe, but
the armour should come in relatively close

00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:15.280
to your natural waist.

00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:20.400
Even armours which had that super efficient
pot belly for weapon deflection still come

00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:23.360
in and sit on the natural waist so they can
shape over the hips.

00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:26.720
Weight distribution matters and waist shaping
is really good for this.

00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:28.000
As for the second reason?

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:32.480
Well, you have to be able to bend in armour,
and that means there needs to be some kind

00:06:32.480 --> 00:06:34.720
of joining or segmentation at the waist.

00:06:34.720 --> 00:06:38.480
If it’s just one flat plate that goes all
the way down to your hips you’re not going

00:06:38.480 --> 00:06:41.680
to be able to bend very effectively which...might
get you in trouble.

00:06:41.680 --> 00:06:43.760
And so the indent at the waist is necessary.

00:06:43.760 --> 00:06:45.920
If you’re facing enemies with weapons they
want to stick to you?

00:06:45.920 --> 00:06:49.200
They want something that’s going to catch
in one of the joins so they have sufficient

00:06:49.200 --> 00:06:53.040
force to knock you off your horse, then a
big cleavage divot is just really asking for

00:06:53.040 --> 00:06:56.240
a polearm to the bust, which is an unpleasant
experience for anyone.

00:06:56.240 --> 00:06:58.880
Breasts don't need to move for your character
to fight.

00:06:58.880 --> 00:07:03.360
Rather the opposite, in fact, so this concave
piece between the breasts is aesthetic but

00:07:03.360 --> 00:07:08.480
entirely unnecessary and in some situations,
a really active disadvantage.

00:07:08.480 --> 00:07:12.080
It serves no practical purpose, unlike the
waist join, and its deepness and steepness

00:07:12.080 --> 00:07:14.720
will make it more of a disadvantage than the
muscle cuirass.

00:07:14.720 --> 00:07:18.800
Now metal plate is pretty darned strong, and
if your armourer is in any way sensible they’re

00:07:18.800 --> 00:07:22.960
not going to make it so it rests directly
on your sternum, so that’s probably not

00:07:22.960 --> 00:07:23.840
going to be an issue.

00:07:23.840 --> 00:07:27.840
But again it will be inherently less good
at distributing the force of strikes because

00:07:27.840 --> 00:07:31.360
of its geometry, so if someone comes at you
hard with a polearm then you are going to

00:07:31.360 --> 00:07:35.360
feel it more than you would if you were in
a more gently curved design.

00:07:35.360 --> 00:07:39.440
And in general, unless she’s a member of
a fantasy race of some kind, women have lower

00:07:39.440 --> 00:07:43.360
bone density than men and so it’s more likely
that you’re going to break a bone anyway

00:07:43.360 --> 00:07:45.280
if someone comes at you with a weapon like
that.

00:07:45.280 --> 00:07:48.960
Frankly I don’t think that force distribution
is the main disadvantage of the cleavage divot,

00:07:48.960 --> 00:07:50.320
I think that it’s 1.

00:07:50.320 --> 00:07:54.240
It makes you stickier so it’s easier to
knock you off your horse, and that’s most

00:07:54.240 --> 00:07:57.440
of the win condition if you’re a medieval
peasant because now they’re on the ground

00:07:57.440 --> 00:08:01.280
and maybe unarmed and this is a very bad day
for them, but also because of point 3 which

00:08:01.280 --> 00:08:02.320
we’ll get to in a second.

00:08:02.320 --> 00:08:05.280
Basically boob plate is the equivalent of
the metal codpiece.

00:08:05.280 --> 00:08:09.760
It’s there for fashion, your actual boobs
or penis should not be in there, it’s not

00:08:09.760 --> 00:08:13.520
a bra, it should not actually be resting on
your skin, and there are some disadvantages

00:08:13.520 --> 00:08:17.680
you need to consider if you want to make it
comically huge, even if the armour is sci-fi

00:08:17.680 --> 00:08:21.040
and sci-fi materials and so very light so
weight isn’t an issue.

00:08:21.040 --> 00:08:25.760
Also note what was acceptable in tournament
armour was either toned down on the battlefield

00:08:25.760 --> 00:08:30.880
or reserved on the battlefield for dudes who
were not expected to do a lot of actual fighting.

00:08:31.600 --> 00:08:33.680
You know, important people.

00:08:33.680 --> 00:08:35.600
If that’s true for your lady, crack on.

00:08:35.600 --> 00:08:40.640
If not...maybe consider making it more of
a gentle indent than a giant valley.

00:08:40.640 --> 00:08:41.280
3.

00:08:41.280 --> 00:08:42.480
Consider mobility.

00:08:42.480 --> 00:08:46.320
Remember that I said, probably a couple of
times at this point, that armour requires

00:08:46.320 --> 00:08:48.000
space in the chest cavity for breathing?

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:52.800
Well, please imagine you have that, and then
on top of it you’ve hammered out extra unnecessary

00:08:52.800 --> 00:08:54.480
space to make boobs.

00:08:54.480 --> 00:09:00.720
At what point does this become a problem for
mobility when wielding weapons, particularly

00:09:00.720 --> 00:09:01.840
two handed weapons?

00:09:01.840 --> 00:09:02.880
Something to consider.

00:09:02.880 --> 00:09:06.080
This is a particular problem for two plate
boob plate.

00:09:06.080 --> 00:09:09.840
Even if you have beautiful strong light sci-fi
armor for your characters and you don't need

00:09:09.840 --> 00:09:12.000
to weigh the consequences (heh).

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:17.040
If you want some extra enboobening for aesthetic
reasons do consider range of motion and mobility

00:09:17.040 --> 00:09:18.240
when wielding weapons.

00:09:18.240 --> 00:09:20.640
All armor restricts mobility to a certain
extent.

00:09:20.640 --> 00:09:23.280
You know what rather restricts range of motion
at the front?

00:09:23.280 --> 00:09:24.320
Solid breasts.

00:09:24.320 --> 00:09:27.520
If your character is a large-chested lady
to begin with then she's just going to have

00:09:27.520 --> 00:09:31.600
to cope with some degree of restriction but
you don't want to add to a generously endowed

00:09:31.600 --> 00:09:35.760
woman's troubles by adding extra boobs over
the top of her existing boobs.

00:09:35.760 --> 00:09:37.600
Especially because past a certain point you&nbsp;

00:09:37.600 --> 00:09:40.240
just can't use some two-handed&nbsp;
weapons effectively.

00:09:40.240 --> 00:09:45.200
Especially if you've decided to go the flipping
Landsknecht route and give her a giant sword,

00:09:45.200 --> 00:09:49.280
because the way that you wield one of these
is you make a really solid triangle with your

00:09:49.280 --> 00:09:50.960
arms and you move from there.

00:09:50.960 --> 00:09:55.600
The ‘moving from there’ part might be
slightly tricky if you've got too much going

00:09:55.600 --> 00:09:56.240
on up top.

00:09:56.240 --> 00:10:00.320
Bear in mind also that breasts in a push-up
bra are not equivalent to breasts in a sports

00:10:00.320 --> 00:10:04.800
bra and maybe chill a little bit with the
giant-boobed anime girl look.

00:10:04.800 --> 00:10:08.960
If use of weapons is important to this character
you have kitted out in armor then don't give

00:10:08.960 --> 00:10:13.600
her a comedy breastplate that will require
you to do an Elsa from Frozen and pass her

00:10:13.600 --> 00:10:16.480
arms through her boobs every time she wants
to move her sword.

00:10:16.480 --> 00:10:18.320
Breasts are squishy, they move.

00:10:18.320 --> 00:10:22.880
Armor generally not, so as far as possible
you don't want armor that extends out past

00:10:22.880 --> 00:10:25.360
the sides of your actual&nbsp;
torso, and when considering&nbsp;

00:10:25.360 --> 00:10:28.080
how big to make the chest, consider how easy

00:10:28.080 --> 00:10:29.440
it will be to move your arms.

00:10:29.440 --> 00:10:33.920
So a couple of extra things to bear in mind:
the first is that I'm being kind of ungenerous

00:10:33.920 --> 00:10:39.920
with the underlayers in order to make it as
fair as possible, possibly too fair, I have

00:10:39.920 --> 00:10:45.680
one layer on underneath a turtleneck which
is not terribly thick.

00:10:45.680 --> 00:10:49.920
Gamebsons are generally thicker than that
so you've got more restriction to begin with

00:10:49.920 --> 00:10:51.280
before you start adding layers.

00:10:51.280 --> 00:10:55.200
Second point to consider: my armor is made
of cardboard (I was going to add extra bits

00:10:55.200 --> 00:10:58.720
over the hips but I just could not be bothered)
and so because of that it's already got a

00:10:58.720 --> 00:11:00.640
lot more flex than metal armor.

00:11:00.640 --> 00:11:03.120
It is also marginally thinner than metal armor.

00:11:03.120 --> 00:11:08.160
Something that you can see when I put on the
one that's just completely ridiculous anime

00:11:08.160 --> 00:11:13.760
girl plate is that it's very hard to do a
low guard, and particularly, regardless of

00:11:13.760 --> 00:11:17.600
what you do you can't generate the power that
you would normally in a low guard.

00:11:17.600 --> 00:11:21.360
Given that the vast majority of women are
less strong than the vast majority of men

00:11:21.360 --> 00:11:25.920
this is not a great thing to do because you're
already at a disadvantage when it comes to

00:11:25.920 --> 00:11:26.880
power generation.

00:11:26.880 --> 00:11:31.360
If you have a bigger plate you either have
to put your arms underneath and if the plate

00:11:31.360 --> 00:11:35.680
is too big then you just can't follow through
like that or you have to put them over the

00:11:35.680 --> 00:11:40.000
top which means you aren't generating as much
power with the top arm.

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:45.040
In general, uh, I need all the help I can
get so I would not be going for that.

00:11:45.040 --> 00:11:49.520
One last thing: I mentioned before about not
wanting your sex to be known on the battlefield

00:11:49.520 --> 00:11:53.120
and I think that's a pretty&nbsp;
sensible consideration.

00:11:53.120 --> 00:11:57.840
Because women are generally weaker than men
you don't necessarily want to draw attention

00:11:57.840 --> 00:12:03.200
to yourself as a woman because you pick yourself
out as a weaker target, or a potentially weaker

00:12:03.200 --> 00:12:04.000
target at least.

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:07.680
To say nothing of painting a target on your
back for other kinds of violence which we

00:12:07.680 --> 00:12:11.200
will not mention specifically because I'm
still holding out the hope that this video

00:12:11.200 --> 00:12:15.600
won't get demonetized even though I've said
the word boobs about 100 times.

00:12:16.960 --> 00:12:17.680
There you go.

00:12:17.680 --> 00:12:19.920
4: breathing is important.

00:12:19.920 --> 00:12:22.560
This point is about closeness of fit specifically.

00:12:22.560 --> 00:12:28.080
When it comes to the relative size of the
character in the armor don't take video games

00:12:28.080 --> 00:12:30.000
as your jumping-off point.

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:34.080
Game characters do not need to expand their
chests to breathe, they just need to look

00:12:34.080 --> 00:12:34.800
like they're breathing.

00:12:34.800 --> 00:12:38.960
If the breastplate is a solid piece real people
will need some space to breathe in there because

00:12:38.960 --> 00:12:41.440
respiration is kind of necessary for life.

00:12:41.440 --> 00:12:44.720
Your actors and stunt performers will thank
you, and so will cosplayers.

00:12:44.720 --> 00:12:48.800
I mention games because they don't really
need realism in armor fit if they don't want

00:12:48.800 --> 00:12:49.280
to have it.

00:12:49.280 --> 00:12:53.680
If the metal seems to be suction molded onto
your character's body including her breasts

00:12:53.680 --> 00:12:58.320
then well i think it looks a bit silly but
it's not actually impeding her because she's

00:12:58.320 --> 00:12:59.200
not real.

00:12:59.200 --> 00:13:02.720
But you probably shouldn't do this with real
people and real metal.

00:13:02.720 --> 00:13:07.600
Or, like this lady is wearing chain mail but
either she has a waist the same circumference

00:13:07.600 --> 00:13:10.880
as her head or she's not wearing any kind
of protective underlayer at all.

00:13:10.880 --> 00:13:12.320
Good luck with those arrows lady!

00:13:12.320 --> 00:13:16.720
It is possible to combine realism and aesthetics
when designing armor, but bear in mind that

00:13:16.720 --> 00:13:21.040
if what you want is cheesecake then you probably
should just go for lingerie.

00:13:21.040 --> 00:13:25.600
Armor is meant to be protective, if armor
is not protective then it's not doing its

00:13:25.600 --> 00:13:29.120
job and so it's just kind of dumb looking.

00:13:29.120 --> 00:13:33.520
This Skyrim armor looks, you know, good if
you're into that sort of thing, but in real

00:13:33.520 --> 00:13:37.360
life that would be someone who has hammered
out extra space over the top of their existing

00:13:37.360 --> 00:13:39.280
bust to give the impression of a bust.

00:13:39.280 --> 00:13:42.480
And especially if you're working with real
people as I said there will come a point where

00:13:42.480 --> 00:13:45.920
that hampers range of motion those of you
who saw my fighting in a corset video will

00:13:45.920 --> 00:13:50.000
know that I punch like someone who doesn't
really know how to punch, but also that fighting

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:54.800
in a corset is not particularly restrictive
as long as you don't do something stupid like

00:13:54.800 --> 00:13:55.920
lace it up really tightly.

00:13:55.920 --> 00:14:00.080
Fabric, even fabric with steel or plastic
bones in it, still has a fair amount of give

00:14:00.080 --> 00:14:00.960
and flex.

00:14:00.960 --> 00:14:06.000
This is not true of solid pieces of metal
or just solid armor in general.

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:09.120
If you look at The Mandalorian’s ladies
in armor you'll note that they have plates

00:14:09.120 --> 00:14:11.200
that are close fitting but they aren't solid.

00:14:11.200 --> 00:14:15.440
There is sci-fi fabric covering the unplated
areas, it will move with them.

00:14:15.440 --> 00:14:19.760
See also again protective gear for motorcycling:
there are plates there for impact protection,

00:14:19.760 --> 00:14:22.080
but mostly it's toughened fabric that's doing
the work.

00:14:22.080 --> 00:14:26.320
If you design a solid form-fitting breastplate
which is meant to be worn by a real human

00:14:26.320 --> 00:14:28.800
woman, then do leave enough space for breathing.

00:14:28.800 --> 00:14:32.880
Enough space for breathing pretty heavily
actually because fighting is quite strenuous.

00:14:32.880 --> 00:14:33.040
Close fitting solid torso armor is just not
going to work.

00:14:33.040 --> 00:14:37.680
If you go for something like modern military
armor but made from a thin sci-fi-ish fabric

00:14:37.680 --> 00:14:41.280
or material (and you put the storage elsewhere)
you'd end up with something that would conform

00:14:41.280 --> 00:14:43.280
to the body reasonably closely.

00:14:43.280 --> 00:14:46.480
It will be less close-fitting if it's meant
to be a solid piece but if you go for the

00:14:46.480 --> 00:14:50.400
separate plates over sci-fi fabric look then
you can reasonably end up with something like

00:14:50.400 --> 00:14:54.880
you would see on The Mandalorian, either on
Cara Dune or on the Mandalorians themselves,

00:14:54.880 --> 00:14:56.080
and it would look pretty good.

00:14:56.080 --> 00:15:00.640
That being said if you go for that option
you definitely don't want a big cleavage divot

00:15:00.640 --> 00:15:04.960
because that might actually sit on your sternum
and then if someone hits you there ow.

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:06.400
Ow?

00:15:06.400 --> 00:15:08.720
Some kind of minor decorative&nbsp;
indent for aesthetics&nbsp;

00:15:08.720 --> 00:15:10.800
is totally possible but don't go nuts.

00:15:10.800 --> 00:15:15.360
Basically female characters in armor are great
and I love them but to borrow a phrase from

00:15:15.360 --> 00:15:19.440
past Jill, it rather pings one’s suspension
of disbelief by the bra strap when they're

00:15:19.440 --> 00:15:23.840
wearing armor that seems to be a sexy afterthought
rather than actually meant to be protective.

00:15:23.840 --> 00:15:27.440
Or when their boob armor is so huge that they're
going to have trouble assuming a guard stance.

00:15:27.440 --> 00:15:30.800
And if a stunt performer is going to have
to fight in this stuff, and your actor is

00:15:30.800 --> 00:15:35.600
going to have to spend 12 hours a day in it,
then comfort and breathing room should be

00:15:35.600 --> 00:15:36.800
big considerations.

00:15:36.800 --> 00:15:40.480
As well as aesthetics obviously, cause: gotta
look good.

00:15:40.480 --> 00:15:44.880
Now I was going to make a point about fencing
chest protectors but I got even more off topic

00:15:44.880 --> 00:15:48.000
than I have been for this entire video, “you
know what's not fun?

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:51.440
Fat necrosis” but if you're interested in
hearing me rant for a few more minutes about

00:15:51.440 --> 00:15:54.640
fencing chest protectors and why they're shaped
like that, “There's a reason they exist

00:15:54.640 --> 00:15:58.400
and it's not to provide costume ideas for
your latest D&amp;D fighter, that's all I'm saying”

00:15:58.400 --> 00:16:01.840
this is the part where I say: this video is
sponsored by Curiosity Stream and they can

00:16:01.840 --> 00:16:02.560
help you out there.

00:16:02.560 --> 00:16:06.000
Curiosity Stream and Nebula have teamed up
for a bundle deal where you get access to

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:10.960

00:16:22.800 --> 00:16:24.640
“you know what this is here to prevent though
right?

00:16:24.640 --> 00:16:28.560
Not death by stabbing-” and Nebula Originals
which are exclusive content that you can't

00:16:28.560 --> 00:16:29.440
see anywhere else.

00:16:29.440 --> 00:16:33.280
Curiosity Stream has thousands of documentaries
that you can access from anywhere in the world

00:16:33.280 --> 00:16:36.960
and you can learn about anything from space,
to katanas, (you know somehow I feel like

00:16:36.960 --> 00:16:40.800
this is a crowd that would appreciate In Love
with the Samurai Sword) to what big cats do

00:16:40.800 --> 00:16:44.160
after dark (no jokes please, The Secret Life
of Big Cats is actually really interesting).

00:16:48.800 --> 00:16:52.800
And now I know that you're all waiting for,
or have skipped to, the lightning round, so

00:16:52.800 --> 00:16:53.600
let's do this.

00:16:53.600 --> 00:16:57.440
Love the look and the colors but there's no
waist segmentation with those metal parts

00:16:57.440 --> 00:16:58.880
so you can't bend.

00:16:58.880 --> 00:17:00.240
And I don't know what this is made of.

00:17:00.240 --> 00:17:03.840
These bits look metal but if you were a man
I'd be calling that self-castration plate.

00:17:03.840 --> 00:17:08.080
Maybe all the metal and the purple stuff is
actually bendy like cloth... except in the

00:17:08.080 --> 00:17:09.040
case of the sword.

00:17:09.040 --> 00:17:13.920
Concept looks really nice execution would
need significant tweaking for a real person.

00:17:13.920 --> 00:17:17.920
The metal is over bits that don't bend and
goes all the way to her throat which I appreciate.

00:17:17.920 --> 00:17:22.080
And I like that there's a suggestion of female
secondary sexual characteristics without having

00:17:22.080 --> 00:17:24.960
to make a giant booby plate so: quite like
that.

00:17:24.960 --> 00:17:28.400
This one looks pretty workable actually...
this one might provide more issues.

00:17:28.400 --> 00:17:32.080
I'm a little bit worried about the positioning
of that metal fleur-de-lis and also what is

00:17:32.080 --> 00:17:34.080
with the giant cat bell around her waist?

00:17:34.080 --> 00:17:36.160
Either way it's a really terrible place to
store it.

00:17:36.160 --> 00:17:39.520
But cloth that is actual cloth is good because
no self-castration, yay!

00:17:39.520 --> 00:17:44.800
This isn't even armor how is this even on
the list, but girl, it's meant to be winter.

00:17:44.800 --> 00:17:46.480
You're going to freeze your bits off.

00:17:46.480 --> 00:17:51.040
I mean a little bit two-breasted for my personal
taste but doable for a real human though you

00:17:51.040 --> 00:17:54.160
might need to lessen that divot a bit to make
room for your actual chest.

00:17:54.160 --> 00:17:58.240
See this, this kind of thing just annoys me:
if she's meant to be sexy just put her in

00:17:58.240 --> 00:18:02.880
lingerie, if she's meant to be sexy and dangerous
then give her armor that actually protects

00:18:02.880 --> 00:18:04.880
but also looks really nice.

00:18:04.880 --> 00:18:06.400
Cover her vitals!

00:18:06.400 --> 00:18:10.080
Also metal on bare skin is distinctly unfun.

00:18:10.080 --> 00:18:14.800
See this doesn't particularly bother me because
it's clearly not armor at all.

00:18:14.800 --> 00:18:18.240
The thing that's getting me, aside from the
fact that he gets to cover like 90% of his

00:18:18.240 --> 00:18:23.760
torso where she only gets to cover 30%, is
this weird fur/bare skin combination thing.

00:18:23.760 --> 00:18:28.480
If you live in a hot climate don't wear very
many clothes but make them of lighter fabrics.

00:18:28.480 --> 00:18:32.720
If you live in a cold climate wear fur but
cover as much of your body with it as possible.

00:18:32.720 --> 00:18:35.280
Or are those feathers, I genuinely can't tell.

00:18:35.280 --> 00:18:36.200
Moving on.

00:18:36.200 --> 00:18:37.840
[laughter] amazing.

00:18:38.560 --> 00:18:42.320
Armor that's broken up at the waist, protection
all the way to the neck, breathing is obviously

00:18:42.320 --> 00:18:45.680
possible, no boob plate and that's totally
fine, liking it.

00:18:45.680 --> 00:18:50.320
I have mentioned this in a previous video
but I absolutely hate the giant combat wedges,

00:18:50.320 --> 00:18:55.360
and that swimsuit piece between the legs is
just asking for thrush or chafing or both.

00:18:55.360 --> 00:19:00.160
But the segmentation means that she can probably
bend at the waist and honestly overall I quite

00:19:00.160 --> 00:19:04.400
like the look just get rid of the swimsuit
crotch piece and the heels and we're good

00:19:04.400 --> 00:19:04.880
to go.

00:19:04.880 --> 00:19:10.480
I love those metal rings as bracers and gorget,
no helmet but you know: movies, and can we

00:19:10.480 --> 00:19:15.120
just take a moment to appreciate those nice
flat sturdy boots [sigh].

00:19:15.120 --> 00:19:19.440
Also as a costume design point, I like that
she has slightly different patterning and

00:19:19.440 --> 00:19:23.120
gold accoutrements as opposed to the rest
of the Dora Milaje who have silver.

00:19:23.120 --> 00:19:26.480
In real life I think that boob shelf would
have to be a little bit less pronounced for

00:19:26.480 --> 00:19:30.560
mobility's sake but I really like that they
have the badge in the middle instead of having

00:19:30.560 --> 00:19:31.600
a big indent.

00:19:31.600 --> 00:19:34.720
Like there's a suggestion of an indent but
it's not really going to be a big issue.

00:19:34.720 --> 00:19:37.680
Give me some more waist segmentation and a
helmet and I am there.

00:19:37.680 --> 00:19:40.400
I mean look at it, it's so pretty and shiny.

00:19:41.120 --> 00:19:41.920
I like shiny.

00:19:41.920 --> 00:19:44.480
And if you made it to the end of this video,
congratulations.

00:19:44.480 --> 00:19:48.640
I offer you this footage of my cats being
extremely unimpressed that I am filming them

00:19:48.640 --> 00:19:49.360
as a reward.

00:19:49.360 --> 00:19:52.960
Which means that you can go into the comment
section and comment ‘kitties!’ and everyone

00:19:52.960 --> 00:19:55.680
who hasn't watched the video all the way to
the end will be very confused.

00:19:55.680 --> 00:20:00.080
Anyway I feel better having got all that off
my chest [heh] so I'll see you next time.
