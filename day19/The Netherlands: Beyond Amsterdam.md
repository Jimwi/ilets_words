00:00:00.567 --> 00:00:01.300
Hi, I'm Rick Steves,

00:00:01.300 --> 00:00:03.767
back with more of
the best of Europe.

00:00:03.767 --> 00:00:05.367
The people here claim

00:00:05.367 --> 00:00:06.433
if you stand on a chair

00:00:06.433 --> 00:00:09.066
you can see
all across their country.

00:00:09.066 --> 00:00:11.500
This is the Best of
the Netherlands.

00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:13.600
Thanks for joining us.

00:00:44.433 --> 00:00:46.066
Traveling here,
it's easy to see

00:00:46.066 --> 00:00:48.433
how the Netherlands is a lot
like its people --

00:00:48.433 --> 00:00:50.567
efficient, a good balance
of old and new,

00:00:50.567 --> 00:00:54.100
hard work and fun,
innovation and tradition.

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:55.400
Even with a dense population

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:57.433
and an ongoing battle
with the sea,

00:00:57.433 --> 00:00:59.467
the Dutch are warm
and even-keeled.

00:00:59.467 --> 00:01:02.300
We'll cruise through
a mighty port,

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:05.767
go for an old-fashioned sail,

00:01:05.767 --> 00:01:08.533
and visit the ultimate
flower market.

00:01:08.533 --> 00:01:11.433
We'll marvel at Dutch masters,

00:01:11.433 --> 00:01:13.433
smoke some eels,

00:01:13.433 --> 00:01:18.533
pull out all the stops on
an unforgettable organ,

00:01:18.533 --> 00:01:22.066
and start up
a classic windmill.

00:01:22.066 --> 00:01:24.433
In the west of Europe
is the Netherlands,

00:01:24.433 --> 00:01:27.500
with 12 provinces including
North and South Holland.

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:31.367
Everything we'll see is within
an hour of Amsterdam.

00:01:31.367 --> 00:01:34.066
We'll sail what was
the Zuiderzee,

00:01:34.066 --> 00:01:35.100
blocked off by long dams,

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:38.433
explore characteristic towns
from Delft to Rotterdam

00:01:38.433 --> 00:01:44.300
and Haarlem to Marken,
with lots in between.

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:47.433
Most Dutch travel dreams are set
in the area called Holland,

00:01:47.433 --> 00:01:50.467
and that's where we'll
be spending most of our time.

00:01:50.467 --> 00:01:52.100
Like many fortified old cities,

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:56.133
Delft, welcomes you with the
twin towers of its city gate,

00:01:56.133 --> 00:01:59.433
graced by an old drawbridge
and a canal moat.

00:01:59.433 --> 00:02:04.100
It's delightful architecture
recalls the Golden Age --

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:07.300
the 17th century pinnacle
of Dutch trade and sea power.

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:10.400
Quaint scenes line
intimate canals.

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:13.467
It's Thursday, and that means
market day in Delft.

00:02:13.467 --> 00:02:15.433
In towns all over
the Netherlands,

00:02:15.433 --> 00:02:19.433
main squares become thriving
markets one day a week.

00:02:19.433 --> 00:02:20.667
It's late June,

00:02:20.667 --> 00:02:23.433
and the Herring
are in season.

00:02:24.066 --> 00:02:27.233
And every market
comes with a cheesemonger,

00:02:27.233 --> 00:02:31.433
almost evangelical about
the tastiness of Dutch cheese.

00:02:31.433 --> 00:02:34.200
Ask a question and you're in for
an education

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:35.600
complete with samples.

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:38.333
This is young --
how young is this?

00:02:38.333 --> 00:02:40.767
Um, about four to six weeks.

00:02:40.767 --> 00:02:41.667
So, tell me about this one.

00:02:41.667 --> 00:02:45.166
Four and a half years old,
hand-made and quite strong.

00:02:45.166 --> 00:02:50.600
We have -- sometimes is, we have
them even older.

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:55.433
I like that -- give me a glass
of port and this is my dessert.

00:02:55.433 --> 00:02:57.700
Towering over the square
is the church,

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:02.433
with its brick steeple
rocketing skyward.

00:03:02.433 --> 00:03:05.367
And facing that, overseeing
the town's commerce

00:03:05.367 --> 00:03:08.033
as it has for nearly
a thousand years,

00:03:08.033 --> 00:03:08.633
is the City Hall.

00:03:08.633 --> 00:03:12.433
Much of the Netherlands
is built on soggy land.

00:03:12.433 --> 00:03:15.200
The City Hall,
with its heavy stone jail,

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:17.767
was built on the most solid
land in town.

00:03:17.767 --> 00:03:21.233
The leaning church,
just down the canal,

00:03:21.233 --> 00:03:21.633
not so much.

00:03:21.633 --> 00:03:24.600
The town's historic canals
both drained the land

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:28.033
and provided a transportation
network for barges.

00:03:28.033 --> 00:03:30.567
Today, the old barges
are retired --

00:03:30.567 --> 00:03:32.333
many are permanently moored

00:03:32.333 --> 00:03:34.133
in front of cafes
and restaurants

00:03:34.133 --> 00:03:34.667
for outdoor dining.

00:03:34.667 --> 00:03:37.433
Over the centuries,
these little canals

00:03:37.433 --> 00:03:39.567
shipped out countless
barge loads

00:03:39.567 --> 00:03:43.300
of the town's famed
earthenware.

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:46.033
Delftware is famous
all around the world.

00:03:46.033 --> 00:03:48.633
Royal Delft, the oldest
surviving workshop,

00:03:48.633 --> 00:03:50.433
established back in
the 1600s,

00:03:50.433 --> 00:03:53.433
welcomes visitors to drop in
and see how it's made.

00:03:53.433 --> 00:03:56.367
Visitors to the factory
follow the process.

00:03:56.367 --> 00:04:01.533
First, the liquid clay is poured
into plaster molds.

00:04:02.667 --> 00:04:04.433
When dry, it's removed

00:04:04.433 --> 00:04:09.233
and the seams are
smoothed off.

00:04:09.233 --> 00:04:11.667
Then it's baked.

00:04:11.667 --> 00:04:14.433
And then,
lovingly painted by hand.

00:04:14.433 --> 00:04:20.433
A mesmerizing scene
unchanged for centuries.

00:04:20.433 --> 00:04:23.533
After being glazed
to fix the paint,

00:04:23.533 --> 00:04:25.166
it's baked a second time

00:04:25.166 --> 00:04:27.433
during which
the paint turns blue.

00:04:27.433 --> 00:04:32.166
That's the secret of
Royal Delft Blue since 1653.

00:04:32.166 --> 00:04:36.266
The finished product --
this highly valued earthenware.

00:04:36.266 --> 00:04:43.333
Rooms of historic Delftware
show off this art.

00:04:43.333 --> 00:04:44.600
This table setting is laid out

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:49.266
as if it was the home of
a wealthy person here in Delft.

00:04:49.266 --> 00:04:54.467
The Netherlands is small --
smaller than West Virginia --

00:04:54.467 --> 00:04:58.200
and the most densely populated
country in Europe.

00:04:58.200 --> 00:05:00.500
Most of the country
is below sea level,

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:05.767
reclaimed with great effort over
many generations from the sea.

00:05:05.767 --> 00:05:07.166
That's why they like to say,

00:05:07.166 --> 00:05:10.734
"God made the world,
but the Dutch, we made Holland."

00:05:10.734 --> 00:05:12.667
This is polder land.

00:05:12.667 --> 00:05:14.433
Much of it once covered
by the sea,

00:05:14.433 --> 00:05:18.433
it was encircled by dikes
and dams and then drained.

00:05:18.433 --> 00:05:19.467
To pump out all that water,

00:05:19.467 --> 00:05:23.667
the Dutch used one of their
leading natural resources --

00:05:23.667 --> 00:05:24.467
the wind.

00:05:24.467 --> 00:05:28.233
For centuries,
the Dutch built windmills.

00:05:28.233 --> 00:05:30.600
Over a thousand survive,
and many still work.

00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:34.433
Some welcome visitors
interested in a peek at

00:05:34.433 --> 00:05:35.400
the clever engine

00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:38.734
that powered the creation
of this land.

00:05:41.133 --> 00:05:45.433
I'm standing on reclaimed land,
12 feet below sea level.

00:05:45.433 --> 00:05:47.033
The challenge for the Dutch --

00:05:47.033 --> 00:05:50.100
to keep this land dry
by pumping water uphill.

00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:52.400
Many windmills
used their wind power

00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:55.300
to turn an Archimedes' screw,
like this,

00:05:55.300 --> 00:05:56.700
which, by rotating in a tube,

00:05:56.700 --> 00:05:59.166
lifted water up
and over the dike.

00:05:59.166 --> 00:06:01.667
To catch the desired
amount of wind,

00:06:01.667 --> 00:06:03.433
millers, like expert sailors,

00:06:03.433 --> 00:06:06.300
know just how much to unfurl
the sails --

00:06:06.300 --> 00:06:08.400
or furl them back,
as necessary.

00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:12.433
Mills are built with sturdy
oak timber frames

00:06:12.433 --> 00:06:15.633
to withstand
the constant tension.

00:06:15.633 --> 00:06:20.433
These timbers have stood strong
since the 1600s.

00:06:20.433 --> 00:06:22.734
When the direction of
the wind shifts,

00:06:22.734 --> 00:06:25.433
the miller turns the cap
of the building --

00:06:25.433 --> 00:06:29.500
which weighs many tons --
to face the breeze.

00:06:29.500 --> 00:06:32.433
As he spins the winch,

00:06:32.433 --> 00:06:36.433
it all slides on these
wooden roller bearings.

00:06:36.433 --> 00:06:37.667
Then, with a hefty chain,

00:06:37.667 --> 00:06:41.433
he anchors it
in the correct spot.

00:06:42.500 --> 00:06:44.367
As the wooden cogs connect,

00:06:44.367 --> 00:06:46.767
wind becomes
clean power,

00:06:46.767 --> 00:06:53.400
Archimedes' screw rotates,
and the water spirals up.

00:06:54.767 --> 00:07:00.266
The Dutch had long eyed what was
the vast inland Zuiderzee

00:07:00.266 --> 00:07:02.200
as a source of new land.

00:07:02.200 --> 00:07:07.033
This 18-mile-long dam was built
as one of many steps

00:07:07.033 --> 00:07:10.700
in turning that sea
into farmland.

00:07:14.467 --> 00:07:15.300
The master plan --

00:07:15.300 --> 00:07:17.433
cordon off sections of
the shallow sea

00:07:17.433 --> 00:07:20.467
with hundreds of miles of
dams and dikes like this.

00:07:20.467 --> 00:07:22.667
Then, by draining
each section dry,

00:07:22.667 --> 00:07:25.767
piece by piece,
build a bigger country.

00:07:25.767 --> 00:07:27.300
These fields were once

00:07:27.300 --> 00:07:29.700
the bottom of that
wide-open sea.

00:07:29.700 --> 00:07:32.200
Gradually,
land was reclaimed,

00:07:32.200 --> 00:07:34.367
and today the Netherlands is

00:07:34.367 --> 00:07:37.200
twice the size
it was 400 years ago.

00:07:37.200 --> 00:07:38.433
Because of this reclamation,

00:07:38.433 --> 00:07:41.600
what had been fishing villages
on little islands --

00:07:41.600 --> 00:07:45.500
like Schokland --
are now high and dry mounds

00:07:45.500 --> 00:07:47.500
rising above fertile farmland.

00:07:47.500 --> 00:07:51.300
Behind this sturdy
stone-and-wood seawall,

00:07:51.300 --> 00:07:54.700
this tiny community
once harvested the sea.

00:07:54.700 --> 00:08:00.133
In its day, this cannon warned
visitors of a high tide.

00:08:02.266 --> 00:08:03.433
I'm standing below sea level.

00:08:03.433 --> 00:08:06.433
I know that because I picked up
a handful of dirt

00:08:06.433 --> 00:08:08.433
and it came with some shells --

00:08:08.433 --> 00:08:09.266
and this marks sea level

00:08:09.266 --> 00:08:12.300
according to the official
Amsterdam measure, zero.

00:08:12.300 --> 00:08:14.567
Imagine, a couple
generations ago,

00:08:14.567 --> 00:08:16.233
this buoy bobbed in the harbor.

00:08:16.233 --> 00:08:21.533
What was the bottom of the sea
is now productive farmland.

00:08:21.533 --> 00:08:22.533
The salty seabed soil,

00:08:22.533 --> 00:08:26.700
with a mix of rain, sunshine,
and clever crop rotation,

00:08:26.700 --> 00:08:29.533
eventually becomes
extremely fertile.

00:08:29.533 --> 00:08:33.667
One thing the polder soil grows
particularly well

00:08:33.667 --> 00:08:35.133
is flowers.

00:08:35.133 --> 00:08:39.133
And here at the Aalsmeer
flower auction, it's clear --

00:08:39.133 --> 00:08:41.600
flowers are big business
in Holland.

00:08:41.600 --> 00:08:43.400
Visitors are welcome in this,

00:08:43.400 --> 00:08:46.667
one of the world's largest
commercial buildings.

00:08:46.667 --> 00:08:51.500
They witness millions of dollars
in the trafficking of flowers.

00:08:51.500 --> 00:08:52.433
In its auction halls,

00:08:52.433 --> 00:08:56.600
hundreds of wholesalers
bid on trainloads of flowers

00:08:56.600 --> 00:08:58.667
as they roll by.

00:08:58.667 --> 00:09:02.233
To get the flowers out
as fresh as possible,

00:09:02.233 --> 00:09:03.567
everything happens fast,

00:09:03.567 --> 00:09:06.033
including the bidding.

00:09:06.033 --> 00:09:07.433
A "Dutch auction" is speedy

00:09:07.433 --> 00:09:10.667
because the prices go
from high to low.

00:09:10.667 --> 00:09:13.467
Batches of flowers
are sold to the first buyer

00:09:13.467 --> 00:09:15.433
to press the button.

00:09:15.433 --> 00:09:17.100
Buyers must be
lightning-quick --

00:09:17.100 --> 00:09:21.433
it's the only way to sell
so many flowers in one morning.

00:09:21.433 --> 00:09:22.667
Strolling the fragrant catwalk,

00:09:22.667 --> 00:09:24.433
it's fun to peer down
on the action.

00:09:24.433 --> 00:09:28.300
They boast that fresh flowers go
from cutting in the fields

00:09:28.300 --> 00:09:33.066
to flower shops anywhere
in Europe within 24 hours.

00:09:33.066 --> 00:09:36.133
Workers scramble to get each
buyer's purchase assembled

00:09:36.133 --> 00:09:37.100
on a train
and shipped out.

00:09:37.100 --> 00:09:40.700
The Dutch are the world's
leading flower exporters --

00:09:40.700 --> 00:09:42.633
80% of these flowers
are going abroad.

00:09:42.633 --> 00:09:48.166
Every day from this building,
20 million flowers are shipped,

00:09:48.166 --> 00:09:51.600
destined to make someone's day.

00:09:57.166 --> 00:10:00.133
The industrious heritage
of the Dutch people

00:10:00.133 --> 00:10:02.467
is evident in its many
historic cities.

00:10:02.467 --> 00:10:05.100
Haarlem is a "Dutch masters"
kind of town

00:10:05.100 --> 00:10:08.266
with plenty of
17th-century architecture.

00:10:08.266 --> 00:10:09.433
The town gate,

00:10:09.433 --> 00:10:12.734
no longer needed as part of
its fortification,

00:10:12.734 --> 00:10:14.433
welcomes all into
a delightful Old Town.

00:10:14.433 --> 00:10:18.433
Haarlem's market square --
traffic-free since the 1960s --

00:10:18.433 --> 00:10:22.033
has been the town's focal point
for centuries.

00:10:22.033 --> 00:10:24.367
The herring stand
is a standard feature

00:10:24.367 --> 00:10:26.600
of small town squares
throughout Holland.

00:10:26.600 --> 00:10:30.166
Hello, is it herring time now?
Are these fresh?

00:10:30.166 --> 00:10:32.166
That's fresh,
it's now herring season.

00:10:32.166 --> 00:10:34.734
-RICK: In the summertime?
-Yeah, summertime.

00:10:34.734 --> 00:10:36.433
RICK: So, what are my options?

00:10:36.433 --> 00:10:38.500
The options --
outside of Amsterdam,

00:10:38.500 --> 00:10:39.533
they grab it from the tail

00:10:39.533 --> 00:10:43.033
and just slide it inside
and they bite it.

00:10:43.033 --> 00:10:45.633
-And in Amsterdam?
-In Amsterdam we cut it
in pieces.

00:10:45.633 --> 00:10:47.367
Let's have it Amsterdam style.

00:10:47.367 --> 00:10:48.467
Yeah.

00:10:48.467 --> 00:10:50.433
Do you want onions
and pickles with it?

00:10:50.433 --> 00:10:52.433
-RICK: What is the normal way?
-With everything.

00:10:52.433 --> 00:10:54.433
-I'll have everything.
-The whole package?

00:10:54.433 --> 00:10:56.433
RICK: The whole package.
Beautiful.

00:10:56.433 --> 00:10:57.767
And this is actually raw?

00:10:57.767 --> 00:11:00.066
This is raw,
it's marinated with salt.

00:11:00.066 --> 00:11:01.567
And then we eat it with
the Dutch flag.

00:11:01.567 --> 00:11:04.400
RICK: So, this is a patriotic
duty in the Netherlands.

00:11:04.400 --> 00:11:07.433
Is this -- people say this is
a healthy thing to eat.

00:11:07.433 --> 00:11:08.266
It is.

00:11:08.266 --> 00:11:11.767
RICK: So, how do you say
"delicious and healthy"?

00:11:11.767 --> 00:11:15.300
-Lekker en gezond.
-Lekker en gezond.

00:11:15.300 --> 00:11:16.734
Yeah.

00:11:16.734 --> 00:11:19.166
-Raw fish.
-Raw fish.

00:11:19.166 --> 00:11:19.734
Mmm, why not?

00:11:19.734 --> 00:11:21.600
This will make me
a good man?

00:11:21.600 --> 00:11:23.133
You already are,

00:11:23.133 --> 00:11:24.567
but now you're better.

00:11:24.567 --> 00:11:26.433
[Laughs]
Mmm!

00:11:26.433 --> 00:11:28.467
Lekker en gezond!

00:11:28.467 --> 00:11:31.467
To uncover some of
Haarlem's sites,

00:11:31.467 --> 00:11:35.233
dodge bikes down narrow,
characteristic lanes.

00:11:35.233 --> 00:11:35.734
Just down the street,

00:11:35.734 --> 00:11:40.166
Haarlem's top museum features
the work of its most famous son,

00:11:40.166 --> 00:11:42.433
the great portrait artist
Frans Hals.

00:11:42.433 --> 00:11:45.133
Here, in a room full of
his masterpieces,

00:11:45.133 --> 00:11:49.467
we get a good taste of
Protestant Dutch art.

00:11:49.467 --> 00:11:51.367
When the Dutch
broke away from

00:11:51.367 --> 00:11:53.633
Spain and the Catholic Church
in the 1600s,

00:11:53.633 --> 00:11:57.200
they established an independent
Protestant republic.

00:11:57.200 --> 00:11:59.266
While this was great
for freedom,

00:11:59.266 --> 00:12:00.433
it was a crisis for painters --

00:12:00.433 --> 00:12:03.133
no more wealthy bishops
and art-loving kings

00:12:03.133 --> 00:12:04.767
to commission grand
works of art.

00:12:04.767 --> 00:12:07.100
Dutch society
was a merchant society,

00:12:07.100 --> 00:12:10.700
and now artists worked for
a new kind of customer --

00:12:10.700 --> 00:12:11.567
Merchants.

00:12:11.567 --> 00:12:14.433
These are ego-boosting portraits
of city big shots.

00:12:14.433 --> 00:12:18.433
They epitomize the independent
and upwardly mobile Dutch

00:12:18.433 --> 00:12:19.433
of the 17th century --

00:12:19.433 --> 00:12:22.133
the men who made
the Golden Age golden.

00:12:22.133 --> 00:12:27.133
These Dutchmen worked hard
and were proud of it.

00:12:28.300 --> 00:12:30.433
Here, some business leaders
close a deal.

00:12:30.433 --> 00:12:33.433
They enjoyed displaying
the fruits of their labor,

00:12:33.433 --> 00:12:35.533
like this --
an exquisitely detailed

00:12:35.533 --> 00:12:37.467
still life
of good food.

00:12:37.467 --> 00:12:39.367
No preachy Madonnas or saints,

00:12:39.367 --> 00:12:43.433
but a canvas reminder that this
household ate very well.

00:12:43.433 --> 00:12:48.066
And this family
had some fine pewter ware.

00:12:48.066 --> 00:12:49.567
In this woman's portrait,

00:12:49.567 --> 00:12:51.133
her elegant dress and jewelry

00:12:51.133 --> 00:12:55.433
are painted with as much care
as her face.

00:12:55.433 --> 00:12:58.333
Painters showed
city pride as well.

00:12:58.333 --> 00:13:02.033
A centerpiece of most Dutch
cities is the church.

00:13:02.033 --> 00:13:05.166
You see it in 300-year-old
paintings...

00:13:05.166 --> 00:13:07.734
And you see it today
as you explore.

00:13:07.734 --> 00:13:11.200
Haarlem's Grote Kerk,
or great church,

00:13:11.200 --> 00:13:12.467
towers over the market square

00:13:12.467 --> 00:13:17.633
as if to bless all the business
that takes place below.

00:13:19.100 --> 00:13:21.433
Inside, you find a towering
Gothic nave,

00:13:21.433 --> 00:13:26.266
which was whitewashed and purged
of its Catholic ornamentation

00:13:26.266 --> 00:13:31.100
when the Reformation
arrived in 1566.

00:13:31.100 --> 00:13:32.133
Small frescoed sections,

00:13:32.133 --> 00:13:34.500
revealed when the whitewash
was cleaned off,

00:13:34.500 --> 00:13:38.667
show how the entire church
was originally decorated.

00:13:38.667 --> 00:13:41.433
As was the case in many
Protestant countries,

00:13:41.433 --> 00:13:44.533
rather than huge, preachy works
of visual art,

00:13:44.533 --> 00:13:45.567
like frescos and statues

00:13:45.567 --> 00:13:47.767
promoting the message
of the Church,

00:13:47.767 --> 00:13:50.533
the artistic emphasis
was put on music.

00:13:50.533 --> 00:13:53.433
[Organist playing]

00:13:53.433 --> 00:13:57.066
Protestant churches invested in
mighty pipe organs.

00:13:57.066 --> 00:14:01.367
Haarlem's towering organ
has been giving worship here

00:14:01.367 --> 00:14:05.400
an inspirational soundtrack
since 1738.

00:14:05.400 --> 00:14:09.433
And visitors enjoy
free concerts weekly.

00:14:37.700 --> 00:14:39.467
With Europe's
densest population,

00:14:39.467 --> 00:14:42.333
the Netherlands has invested in
an impressive

00:14:42.333 --> 00:14:44.333
public transportation
infrastructure.

00:14:44.333 --> 00:14:49.400
Buses and trains seem to go
everywhere all the time.

00:14:51.033 --> 00:14:53.300
After leaving Haarlem,
in a few minutes

00:14:53.300 --> 00:14:57.033
we're in Rotterdam, with its
striking new train station.

00:14:57.033 --> 00:15:03.033
Rotterdam has a gleaming skyline
and Europe's largest port.

00:15:03.033 --> 00:15:06.433
It's a reminder of the Dutch
knack for international trade.

00:15:06.433 --> 00:15:11.133
Locals say that while the money
is spent in Amsterdam,

00:15:11.133 --> 00:15:13.100
it's made here in Rotterdam.

00:15:13.100 --> 00:15:15.300
They boast that
shirts in Rotterdam

00:15:15.300 --> 00:15:18.200
are sold with the sleeves
already rolled up.

00:15:18.200 --> 00:15:20.333
A walk through this
thriving pedestrian zone

00:15:20.333 --> 00:15:23.433
complements our quaint
old world sightseeing

00:15:23.433 --> 00:15:25.367
with a dose of
today's reality.

00:15:25.367 --> 00:15:29.133
Rotterdam's harbor is the third
largest in the world.

00:15:29.133 --> 00:15:33.033
With a harbor tour,
you can appreciate

00:15:33.033 --> 00:15:34.133
its immensity.

00:15:34.133 --> 00:15:38.266
The port handles 35,000
ocean-going vessels each year.

00:15:38.266 --> 00:15:40.400
That's almost
100 ships a day.

00:15:40.400 --> 00:15:43.233
While most of these ships
sail the open seas,

00:15:43.233 --> 00:15:45.633
this is where the Rhine River
meets the ocean.

00:15:45.633 --> 00:15:46.433
And from here,

00:15:46.433 --> 00:15:50.266
river boats, filled with either
tourists or cargo,

00:15:50.266 --> 00:15:54.500
can go all the way through
Europe to the Black Sea.

00:16:01.100 --> 00:16:04.333
Back in the 17th century,
The Dutch East India Company,

00:16:04.333 --> 00:16:07.100
which did business in ports
all around the world,

00:16:07.100 --> 00:16:10.400
was, in a way, the first great
multi-national corporation.

00:16:10.400 --> 00:16:13.734
Today, the Dutch with little in
the way of natural resources,

00:16:13.734 --> 00:16:15.734
still make their serious money
in trade.

00:16:15.734 --> 00:16:18.767
They remain among the world's
great shippers.

00:16:18.767 --> 00:16:20.266
After mighty Rotterdam,

00:16:20.266 --> 00:16:22.467
the tiny but historic
port of Hoorn,

00:16:22.467 --> 00:16:25.433
a couple of hours to the north,
seems quaint.

00:16:25.433 --> 00:16:29.367
But in its day,
it was one of six trading cities

00:16:29.367 --> 00:16:33.767
that joined forces to create
the Dutch East India Company.

00:16:33.767 --> 00:16:38.033
It evokes a rich history,
from its once formidable harbor

00:16:38.033 --> 00:16:38.633
to its main square.

00:16:38.633 --> 00:16:41.567
Overlooking the square is
the Westfries Museum,

00:16:41.567 --> 00:16:45.500
which takes you vividly back to
Holland's Golden Age.

00:16:45.500 --> 00:16:47.633
Stepping into
the venerable building,

00:16:47.633 --> 00:16:50.133
which dates from the 1600s,
the floor creaks.

00:16:50.133 --> 00:16:54.166
Its planks were salvaged from
centuries-old trading ships,

00:16:54.166 --> 00:16:57.200
which likely sailed all the way
to the Spice Islands

00:16:57.200 --> 00:16:58.300
on the far side of the world.

00:16:58.300 --> 00:17:02.133
Here, you feel the pride
and power of the Dutch --

00:17:02.133 --> 00:17:03.567
when they dominated world trade

00:17:03.567 --> 00:17:07.467
and brutally capitalized on
their far-flung colonial empire.

00:17:07.467 --> 00:17:11.400
Pondering group portraits
above the mantle,

00:17:11.400 --> 00:17:14.567
you can imagine the influence
and the wealth of these tycoons.

00:17:14.567 --> 00:17:18.467
Here, they're portrayed as if
they control the globe.

00:17:18.467 --> 00:17:20.133
In a way, they did --

00:17:20.133 --> 00:17:22.433
and much of that was
because of the value

00:17:22.433 --> 00:17:24.433
of the spices
they imported.

00:17:24.433 --> 00:17:27.200
With the bland cuisine
of Europe back then,

00:17:27.200 --> 00:17:30.467
you can imagine the demand for
these new, exotic spices.

00:17:30.467 --> 00:17:33.633
You could spice up both
your food and your life

00:17:33.633 --> 00:17:35.200
with peppercorns,

00:17:35.200 --> 00:17:38.066
cloves, and cinnamon.

00:17:38.066 --> 00:17:41.600
And nutmeg was so valuable
it was said a bag of these

00:17:41.600 --> 00:17:44.367
could buy a house
in 17th-century Holland.

00:17:44.367 --> 00:17:49.433
Exploring Holland,
we're struck by the big skies,

00:17:49.433 --> 00:17:53.266
fertile fields,
and flat land.

00:17:56.333 --> 00:17:59.033
The country is bounded by
the North Sea --

00:17:59.033 --> 00:18:01.667
where there are no natural dunes
to keep the sea out,

00:18:01.667 --> 00:18:04.600
the Dutch have had to build
mighty walls or "dikes"

00:18:04.600 --> 00:18:07.133
to protect their farms
and communities.

00:18:07.133 --> 00:18:08.734
Roughly half the people
and half the land

00:18:08.734 --> 00:18:11.066
here in the Netherlands
are below sea level.

00:18:11.066 --> 00:18:13.400
And for 700 years,
the Dutch have developed

00:18:13.400 --> 00:18:16.200
their expertise at keeping
this country dry.

00:18:16.200 --> 00:18:17.367
It's a constant battle.

00:18:17.367 --> 00:18:20.433
And now with climate change
and rising sea levels a reality,

00:18:20.433 --> 00:18:23.433
the work is that much harder
and more expensive.

00:18:23.433 --> 00:18:26.400
Even with impressive dikes
already in place,

00:18:26.400 --> 00:18:29.333
the Dutch are moving mountains
of sand and mud

00:18:29.333 --> 00:18:30.166
to fortify their dikes

00:18:30.166 --> 00:18:31.533
and protect
their next generation.

00:18:31.533 --> 00:18:35.433
Famous for both their frugality
and their foresight,

00:18:35.433 --> 00:18:38.200
the Dutch are investing
billions of Euros

00:18:38.200 --> 00:18:41.567
as climate change makes its
costly impact felt

00:18:41.567 --> 00:18:43.667
on sea level communities here

00:18:43.667 --> 00:18:46.300
and around the globe.

00:18:46.300 --> 00:18:50.300
And flood protection requires
more than massive dikes.

00:18:50.300 --> 00:18:53.133
Built where the big river
meets the sea,

00:18:53.133 --> 00:18:54.633
the Maeslant Storm Surge Barrier

00:18:54.633 --> 00:18:57.767
is an amazing
engineering project.

00:18:57.767 --> 00:18:59.700
When necessary,
its two arms,

00:18:59.700 --> 00:19:02.433
each as long as
the Eiffel Tower is high,

00:19:02.433 --> 00:19:06.300
are swung together
to create a barrier.

00:19:06.300 --> 00:19:10.433
This stops a storm surge from
flooding the Rotterdam delta

00:19:10.433 --> 00:19:11.767
where a million people live.

00:19:11.767 --> 00:19:15.433
Low-lying American cities
are importing Dutch expertise

00:19:15.433 --> 00:19:19.767
as they, too, face the reality
of the future.

00:19:19.767 --> 00:19:23.367
Along with their role as
protectors of the Netherlands,

00:19:23.367 --> 00:19:27.567
some of the dikes and sand dunes
that make the North Sea coast

00:19:27.567 --> 00:19:28.700
are playgrounds as well.

00:19:28.700 --> 00:19:31.433
And ever since
the Industrial Age

00:19:31.433 --> 00:19:32.133
kicked into gear,

00:19:32.133 --> 00:19:35.433
local workers have come here
for their R&amp;R.

00:19:35.433 --> 00:19:38.200
At the sea-side resort
of Scheveningen,

00:19:38.200 --> 00:19:42.233
that Dutch love of life
is cranked way up.

00:19:42.767 --> 00:19:45.600
Rather than
fight the sea,

00:19:45.600 --> 00:19:50.033
here people play in it.

00:19:50.033 --> 00:19:52.433
And for over a century,

00:19:52.433 --> 00:19:57.734
Dutch holiday goers
have enjoyed this promenade.

00:19:57.734 --> 00:19:59.066
With the comfort of knowing

00:19:59.066 --> 00:20:01.400
Dutch engineers are keeping
the sea at bay,

00:20:01.400 --> 00:20:04.567
my favorite days in Holland
are spent below sea level,

00:20:04.567 --> 00:20:07.333
in its quaint
and picturesque corners.

00:20:07.333 --> 00:20:08.734
Here you can experience

00:20:08.734 --> 00:20:11.633
the landscape of Holland
as it was

00:20:11.633 --> 00:20:14.100
back in the 17th century.

00:20:14.100 --> 00:20:15.166
Exploring villages

00:20:15.166 --> 00:20:18.033
that seem to be built on both
land and water,

00:20:18.033 --> 00:20:21.533
you get a sense for what life
must have been like

00:20:21.533 --> 00:20:23.200
for the Dutch centuries ago.

00:20:23.200 --> 00:20:28.500
In the town of Enkhuizen
is the Zuiderzee Museum.

00:20:28.500 --> 00:20:31.567
While the modern world threatens
traditional ways of Dutch life,

00:20:31.567 --> 00:20:35.333
this creative museum
strives to keep them alive

00:20:35.333 --> 00:20:38.500
for future generations
to appreciate.

00:20:38.500 --> 00:20:41.467
Its sprawling layout allows
visitors to travel through

00:20:41.467 --> 00:20:43.500
both time and culture.

00:20:43.500 --> 00:20:46.600
In one corner,
people are living as if still in

00:20:46.600 --> 00:20:48.734
a remote fishing village
back in 1905.

00:20:48.734 --> 00:20:53.333
Exploring the park, you enjoy
intimate slices of life

00:20:53.333 --> 00:20:55.533
from old Holland.

00:20:55.533 --> 00:21:01.433
The coopers artfully make
their barrels watertight.

00:21:06.066 --> 00:21:07.266
The coal furnace is stoked

00:21:07.266 --> 00:21:10.734
to run the belt-driven
laundromat --

00:21:10.734 --> 00:21:15.300
sudsing, agitating,

00:21:15.300 --> 00:21:17.767
and wringing.

00:21:17.767 --> 00:21:22.033
The sail maker
stitches a sail.

00:21:22.033 --> 00:21:25.700
The blacksmith
pounds his iron...

00:21:25.700 --> 00:21:28.367
in his wooden clogs.

00:21:28.367 --> 00:21:31.767
Fishermen are smoking
their eels.

00:21:33.200 --> 00:21:38.266
And visitors devour
the entire experience.

00:21:39.734 --> 00:21:42.734
And here in the Netherlands,
if you know where to look,

00:21:42.734 --> 00:21:46.467
you can also enjoy traditional
experiences outside the museums.

00:21:46.467 --> 00:21:49.567
We're sailing to the fishing
village of Marken

00:21:49.567 --> 00:21:51.467
in a traditional
fishing boat.

00:21:51.467 --> 00:21:54.433
A few of these
venerable boats survive.

00:21:54.433 --> 00:21:55.767
This one earns its keep

00:21:55.767 --> 00:21:57.500
by hiring out to visitors...

00:21:57.500 --> 00:22:00.467
and, in the case of this
motley crew,

00:22:00.467 --> 00:22:02.100
putting them to work.

00:22:02.100 --> 00:22:03.533
How are we doing, Captain?

00:22:03.533 --> 00:22:06.066
Almost!
One more pull.

00:22:06.066 --> 00:22:08.767
Okay.

00:22:11.133 --> 00:22:12.166
RICK: How old is this boat?

00:22:12.166 --> 00:22:17.200
It's from 1904, yeah,
is 110 years old, this boat.

00:22:17.200 --> 00:22:19.433
RICK: What was the purpose?
What was the work it did?

00:22:19.433 --> 00:22:22.066
CAPTAIN: The purpose is fishing
boat, it's a working boat.

00:22:22.066 --> 00:22:25.033
They just did fishing with it,
nothing else.

00:22:25.033 --> 00:22:26.567
Now, back then,
this was salt water, right?

00:22:26.567 --> 00:22:30.533
It was salt water, because there
was no dike in the north,

00:22:30.533 --> 00:22:31.433
so it was salt water.

00:22:31.433 --> 00:22:33.500
So, they fished on herring,
anchovies.

00:22:33.500 --> 00:22:36.300
How many people would work on
the boat when it went out?

00:22:36.300 --> 00:22:39.100
Well, they were with one skipper
and one mate,

00:22:39.100 --> 00:22:41.533
so they actually did it
with two people.

00:22:41.533 --> 00:22:43.433
RICK: Just two?
Only two?

00:22:43.433 --> 00:22:45.133
They sailed and worked the ship,

00:22:45.133 --> 00:22:46.633
even did fishing with it,
with two people.

00:22:46.633 --> 00:22:49.100
RICK: So, they would go fishing
for how many days?

00:22:49.100 --> 00:22:51.333
CAPTAIN: At Sunday they went to
church, of course,

00:22:51.333 --> 00:22:52.767
and they started on
Monday morning,

00:22:52.767 --> 00:22:55.433
and they came back at
Friday evening.

00:22:55.433 --> 00:22:57.633
Five days out,
two men in this ship?

00:22:57.633 --> 00:23:00.400
Yeah, they were --
this was the time of

00:23:00.400 --> 00:23:01.567
wooden ships
and iron man.

00:23:01.567 --> 00:23:06.300
Wooden ships and iron men --
those were the days!

00:23:09.433 --> 00:23:13.300
Marken welcomes visitors
with its charming harbor.

00:23:13.300 --> 00:23:15.433
It's a favorite with
vacationing yachters

00:23:15.433 --> 00:23:19.734
who enjoy late sunsets
with convivial happy hours.

00:23:19.734 --> 00:23:21.700
The oldest homes
in the village

00:23:21.700 --> 00:23:24.433
were built on
the highest ground.

00:23:24.433 --> 00:23:25.433
They huddle together,

00:23:25.433 --> 00:23:28.100
as if finding strength
in numbers

00:23:28.100 --> 00:23:30.500
in the face of
the next flood.

00:23:30.500 --> 00:23:34.233
In the 19th century, this harbor
was the thriving home

00:23:34.233 --> 00:23:36.133
to over a hundred
fishing boats.

00:23:36.133 --> 00:23:38.367
But, along with fishing,
devastating floods

00:23:38.367 --> 00:23:40.433
were a way of life
here in Marken.

00:23:40.433 --> 00:23:41.333
When they walled off the sea

00:23:41.333 --> 00:23:43.567
with a massive dike
fifty miles north of here,

00:23:43.567 --> 00:23:45.533
the salt water turned to
fresh water

00:23:45.533 --> 00:23:46.500
and the sea was controlled.

00:23:46.500 --> 00:23:48.433
It was tough on
the fishing industry,

00:23:48.433 --> 00:23:50.533
but, overall,
good for the people.

00:23:50.533 --> 00:23:52.166
No more floods.

00:23:52.166 --> 00:23:53.300
While Marken remains

00:23:53.300 --> 00:23:56.567
both traditional and idyllic
to this day,

00:23:56.567 --> 00:23:58.367
like much of the Netherlands,

00:23:58.367 --> 00:24:01.734
it's a place where the past
and the present

00:24:01.734 --> 00:24:05.433
mingle comfortably.

00:24:05.433 --> 00:24:07.433
The Netherlands offers travelers

00:24:07.433 --> 00:24:10.433
a rich variety of
sights and experiences.

00:24:10.433 --> 00:24:12.600
And traveling here,
sooner or later,

00:24:12.600 --> 00:24:14.433
you'll find yourself exclaiming,

00:24:14.433 --> 00:24:17.433
"everything's just so...
Dutch!"

00:24:17.433 --> 00:24:18.200
I'm Rick Steves.

00:24:18.200 --> 00:24:20.667
Until next time,
keep on travelin'.

00:24:20.667 --> 00:24:22.533
"Tot ziens!"

00:24:27.767 --> 00:24:30.734
 

00:24:30.734 --> 00:24:33.734
The Netherlands is
a lot like its people --

00:24:33.734 --> 00:24:36.200
warm, even-keeled,
good on bikes.

00:24:36.200 --> 00:24:38.633
Many windmills used
their wind power

00:24:38.633 --> 00:24:42.367
to power -- to turn
an Archimedes' screw like this.

00:24:42.367 --> 00:24:45.600
Sooner or later you find
yourself excra-- exclaiming --

00:24:45.600 --> 00:24:47.000
exclaiming, exclaiming!

00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:51.066
Ooh-hoo-hoo!
