00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:41.900
For generations, we have been taught that we had to believe the story of the Exodus on faith alone.

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:48.400
We were told that Mount Sinai, where Moses received the Ten Commandments was located in Egypt,

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:51.120
but there's no real evidence to make it believable.

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:53.580
No pictures of left behind artifacts.

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:58.920
Practically nothing to validate one of the most important stories of the Bible.

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:08.300
The Bible says over 70 times that the Israelites went out of Egypt to Midian,

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:12.960
which would be mostly or entirely modern day Saudi Arabia.

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:17.440
Is it true that there is very little evidence that the Exodus story happened?

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:21.740
Or have we actually just been looking in the wrong spot?

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:29.480
While the theory of Moses and the Israelites being in Saudi Arabia is a relatively new theory to those of us in the outside world,

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:31.760
it isn't new to the locals living there.

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:37.880
We were frequently approached by Saudis eager to talk to Americans for the first time face to face.

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:41.160
And one of the first things they would say with excitement was:

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:42.820
Did you know Moses was here?

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:44.920
Let me show you where he and his people were.

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:16.740
The tradition that the mountain in Egypt's Sinai Peninsula is Mount Sinai only dates back to the fourth century AD.

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:25.680
New research based on Jewish, Christian, and Islamic sources indicate that there is a tradition that is 600 years older.

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:27.540
And according to that tradition,

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:31.240
Mount Sinai is in northwest Saudi Arabia.

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:34.700
This other tradition points to Jabal Maqla,

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:41.020
a peak on the mountain range known as Jabal al Lawz as the true mountain of Moses.

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:50.760
Several historic sources including Josephus recorded that Mount Sinai is the highest mountain near a city that is today called Al-Bad.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:57.340
Locals refer to Jabal Maqla as Jabal Musa, the Mountain of Moses.

00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:00.920
~ So you call this one Jabal Musa?
- Jabal Musa.

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:07.100
One of the distinguishing features of this mountain is the blackened top that you can see right behind me.

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:11.820
The Bible says that God descended upon Mount Sinai as a fire.

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:17.620
The blackened peaks stick out from the surrounding areas and the rocks are only black from the outside.

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:25.960
Researchers disagree as to whether the blackened rocks are actual evidence of God descending upon the mountain as a fire like the Bible says

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:28.980
or whether it's natural volcanic rock.

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:38.260
A small handful of Americans tried to sneak into this area in the late 1970's and the 1980's.

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:44.120
They were arrested and their photos and videos were confiscated by the Saudi police.

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:47.640
Their evidence was lost.

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:55.080
However, images and videos slowly began leaking out to the outside world.

00:03:57.280 --> 00:03:59.980
According to those who snuck in and were arrested,

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:02.960
these sites were being kept secret by the Saudi regime,

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:08.780
a theocracy that hid them from the world using fences and police and the threat of force.

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:14.300
As I tried to understand why the Saudis were hiding this important site,

00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:17.500
I began reaching out to sources in the Islamic world.

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:23.660
For 15 years, I've been in the fields of intelligence, counter terrorism and international relations.

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:26.960
And one of my best contacts had a story to tell.

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:29.660
He used to belong to a Jihadist group

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:36.360
and he even had meetings with Pakistani intelligence and close associates of Osama Bin Laden.

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:40.260
And now, he's speaking out for the first time.

00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:43.800
Moses flees Egypt after killing an Egyptian who he saw abusing one of the Hebrew slaves.

00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:46.680
He then escapes to Midian as a fugitive.

00:05:47.640 --> 00:05:53.400
In Midian, Moses sits by a well and he meets the daughters of Jethro who are getting water for his flock.

00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:56.180
Moses then marries one of his daughters.

00:05:56.740 --> 00:05:59.400
We are in the ancient land of Midian right now,

00:05:59.660 --> 00:06:04.900
near the town that local describe as originally being the land of Jethro.

00:06:05.320 --> 00:06:11.300
When we visited this area, multiple Saudis approached us to tell us this is where Jethro and Moses resided.

00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:15.160
They excitedly pointed to an ancient well

00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:18.020
that is fenced off and marked as an archeological site.

00:06:18.920 --> 00:06:24.240
The Saudis have long believed that this is the well where Moses met the daughters of Jethro

00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:27.360
and Muslims from around the world come to see it.

00:06:44.020 --> 00:06:48.720
The Book of Exodus says that the Red Sea crossing happened at a spot named Yam Suph.

00:06:49.260 --> 00:06:51.860
But experts have long disagreed about where it was.

00:06:52.380 --> 00:06:57.040
There are two proposed Red Sea crossing sites from Egypt into Saudi Arabia.

00:06:57.600 --> 00:07:03.160
The first candidate is at the Straits of Tiran at the bottom of Egypt's Sinai Peninsula.

00:07:03.360 --> 00:07:06.260
The second candidate is at Egypt's Neweiba beach.

00:07:06.720 --> 00:07:10.520
Dr. Glen Fritz, who has a PhD in environmental geography

00:07:10.680 --> 00:07:16.400
conducted a massive study of the land and all the historical references about where the crossing happened.

00:07:16.980 --> 00:07:19.220
He found only one exact match.

00:07:19.520 --> 00:07:20.920
Egypt's Neweiba beach.

00:07:21.460 --> 00:07:25.500
Newebia beach is almost five miles long and three miles wide

00:07:25.820 --> 00:07:28.820
providing enough room for the Israelite population to fit.

00:07:29.360 --> 00:07:31.940
Here, they'd be trapped with the mountains on both sides,

00:07:32.240 --> 00:07:33.760
the Red Sea in front of them,

00:07:33.900 --> 00:07:36.100
and Pharaoh's army right behind them.

00:07:36.480 --> 00:07:41.380
Amazingly, there is a path under the water from Egypt into Saudi Arabia.

00:07:41.700 --> 00:07:43.340
The path is not too steep.

00:07:43.520 --> 00:07:47.500
The Israelites could have easily walked across if the waters were parted.

00:07:48.360 --> 00:07:51.080
Underwater research by Dr. Lennart Moller

00:07:51.240 --> 00:07:57.020
showed strange shapes in the coral, leading some to believe that the remains of Pharaoh's Army are there.

00:07:57.720 --> 00:08:02.400
According to this theory, the coral wrapped around the debris from Pharaoh's Army

00:08:02.620 --> 00:08:05.720
and retained the shape of the objects after they dissolved.

00:08:06.580 --> 00:08:10.000
When they brought a metal detector down to the coral anomalies,

00:08:10.100 --> 00:08:13.340
the readings were consistent with circular patterns of metal,

00:08:13.620 --> 00:08:15.520
resembling the parts of chariots.

00:08:16.120 --> 00:08:19.540
We had planned to dive near the possible Red Sea crossing point

00:08:19.560 --> 00:08:24.000
because it's a public diving site with stores where you can go and rent diving equipment.

00:08:24.480 --> 00:08:26.020
But we weren't allowed to.

00:08:26.300 --> 00:08:30.060
The Saudi police showed up and they stayed with us until we left.

00:08:57.900 --> 00:09:04.380
After the Red Sea crossing, Moses and the Israelites stop at a place near Mount Sinai named Elim.

00:09:04.660 --> 00:09:05.820
Desperate for water,

00:09:05.940 --> 00:09:10.760
they find a unique location with 12 wells and 70 palms.

00:09:12.840 --> 00:09:15.980
Along the path to the possible real Mount Sinai,

00:09:16.160 --> 00:09:19.360
there is a match for Elim with many palm trees

00:09:19.620 --> 00:09:23.620
and, to this day, 12 wells.

00:09:24.680 --> 00:09:27.300
Saudi locals pointed us to this location

00:09:27.540 --> 00:09:30.500
and specifically referred to it as Elim.

00:09:48.640 --> 00:09:53.080
Another major event by Mount Sinai is the incident with the Golden Calf.

00:09:54.200 --> 00:09:56.460
While Moses is up on Mount Sinai,

00:09:56.620 --> 00:09:59.520
some of his followers begin worshiping a Golden Calf.

00:09:59.820 --> 00:10:02.780
They place it up on a stand and begin worshiping around it

00:10:02.960 --> 00:10:05.120
and they set up an altar in front of it.

00:10:06.280 --> 00:10:08.460
When Moses comes down from Mount Sinai,

00:10:08.700 --> 00:10:14.180
he destroys the Golden Calf and sprinkles its remains into the river that comes down from the mountain.

00:10:14.980 --> 00:10:21.080
Here, in front of the mountain, we had the remains of what may have been that Golden Calf worship site.

00:10:21.460 --> 00:10:25.960
Now behind me in this fenced in archeological site that the Saudis are protecting,

00:10:26.200 --> 00:10:31.560
you see both the stand with many petroglyphs of cows and people worshiping cows

00:10:31.880 --> 00:10:35.080
as well as a structure that is slightly lifted

00:10:35.580 --> 00:10:38.480
that may be the altar in front of the Golden Calf Stand.

00:10:38.760 --> 00:10:43.880
There's a sign in Arabic and English warning intruders against going into the area.

00:10:44.820 --> 00:10:50.100
The local tradition that this is where the Golden Calf was is so strong that if you approach it,

00:10:50.200 --> 00:10:52.460
you'll be suspected of searching for gold.

00:10:53.600 --> 00:10:59.460
According to the Bible, the worshipers of the Golden Calf say:
'These are your gods, O Israel'

00:10:59.880 --> 00:11:03.020
This verse indicates that there are multiple depictions of bulls

00:11:03.200 --> 00:11:05.740
as the Israelites are worshiping the Golden Calf.

00:11:06.840 --> 00:11:10.140
On the top of the stand where the Golden Calf would have been placed,

00:11:10.420 --> 00:11:13.720
there is a circular indent where the rock has been worn down.

00:11:13.960 --> 00:11:18.600
It's speculated that this is where Moses grounded the Golden Calf into powder.

00:11:19.460 --> 00:11:21.680
After Moses destroys the Golden Calf,

00:11:21.980 --> 00:11:24.640
3000 of the Golden Calf worshipers are killed.

00:11:24.960 --> 00:11:27.900
So there must be a spot where thousands of people were buried.

00:11:28.460 --> 00:11:30.320
About four miles from this site,

00:11:30.580 --> 00:11:32.840
there's a massive ancient graveyard

00:11:33.220 --> 00:11:37.440
that appears to be a mass burial site where the graves were dug all at once.

00:11:37.820 --> 00:11:41.160
It's located just outside the plain where the Israelites would have camped,

00:11:41.620 --> 00:11:43.320
so it's exactly where it should be

00:11:43.480 --> 00:11:45.560
if this is where that story took place.

00:11:46.680 --> 00:11:47.340
Here too

00:11:47.340 --> 00:11:53.040
the Saudis have a sign identifying it as an archeological site and it's patrolled by police.

00:12:24.920 --> 00:12:30.440
The Book of Exodus says that Moses built an altar of uncut stone at the foot of Mount Sinai

00:12:30.480 --> 00:12:35.320
and also set up 12 pillars to symbolize the 12 tribes of Israel.

00:12:36.580 --> 00:12:39.060
Right here at the foot of the mountain,

00:12:39.440 --> 00:12:43.780
we see this structure that resembles an ancient altar.

00:12:45.060 --> 00:12:49.260
And what we are standing in right now is probably the animal chutes

00:12:49.260 --> 00:12:53.200
that would lead them to sacrifice at the foot of the mountain.

00:12:54.380 --> 00:12:57.740
The animal chutes lead to this area of the structure,

00:12:58.060 --> 00:13:01.700
which may have been the slaughter platform for animal sacrifices.

00:13:02.660 --> 00:13:05.520
The Saudis of course say this has nothing to do with Moses

00:13:05.880 --> 00:13:11.760
but they admit that they found animal waste and bones underneath this area when they dug.

00:13:12.240 --> 00:13:17.600
People who have been to this site decades ago
say that this site used to be much cleaner

00:13:17.800 --> 00:13:22.000
and you could more clearly see the remains of about 12 pillars,

00:13:22.360 --> 00:13:25.620
as well as a stone platform that they would stand on.

00:13:26.380 --> 00:13:28.460
Near the altar and the 12 pillars,

00:13:28.640 --> 00:13:32.640
Moses reads to the Israelites the Book of the Covenant and they agree to it.

00:13:33.020 --> 00:13:36.820
This means that Moses probably had a spot right above the altar

00:13:36.940 --> 00:13:39.860
that served as a stage in order to address the people.

00:13:40.420 --> 00:13:43.180
Right above this area with the altar and the pillars,

00:13:43.460 --> 00:13:49.540
there is an area that could have been a perfect spot for Moses to be seen and heard when the covenant is made.

00:13:49.840 --> 00:13:53.140
A Saudi local actually pointed to this part of the mountain

00:13:53.140 --> 00:13:58.660
and showed us how Moses' voice would have echoed like he was speaking in a natural amphitheater.

00:13:59.360 --> 00:14:04.560
The Bible says that a brook flowed down from Mount Sinai, providing water for the Israelites.

00:14:04.900 --> 00:14:10.060
The brook must have come down near the altar at the foot of the mountain for the sacrifices to take place

00:14:10.340 --> 00:14:15.540
and the brook mustn't come near the Golden Calf because Moses threw it's remains into the river.

00:14:16.180 --> 00:14:20.880
It's very easy to see where there was once a stream coming down from this mountain

00:14:21.100 --> 00:14:23.400
where there's evidence of burnt sacrifices.

00:14:23.740 --> 00:14:26.920
It then ends up near the possible Golden Calf worship site.

00:14:27.100 --> 00:14:31.720
There's even evidence of wells around the area
where a pool of water would have formed,

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:34.640
proving that a large population once lived there.

00:14:35.540 --> 00:14:40.760
According to the Bible, the prophet Elijah travels to Mount Sinai and once he gets there,

00:14:40.900 --> 00:14:43.860
he goes into a cave and that's where he talks to God.

00:14:44.180 --> 00:14:50.520
The real Mount Sinai must therefore have a cave
that is accessible, safe and suitable for sleeping.

00:14:50.860 --> 00:14:57.180
This cave above the altar is about 15 feet high,
20 feet long and 20 feet deep.

00:14:57.660 --> 00:15:02.860
If this is the real Mount Sinai, then this is almost certainly the cave of Elijah.

00:15:17.560 --> 00:15:21.640
On the way to Mount Sinai,
the Israelites camp where there's no water.

00:15:22.040 --> 00:15:24.240
Moses goes up to a distinct rock

00:15:24.500 --> 00:15:29.840
and strikes it with his rod and miraculously
 water pours forth for his followers.

00:15:30.620 --> 00:15:35.540
The historian Josephus said that The Split Rock
could still be seen in his time

00:15:35.680 --> 00:15:38.560
and it was so big that it could not have been moved.

00:15:39.560 --> 00:15:46.280
Is it possible that this split rock still remains today, testifying to the accuracy of this story?

00:15:46.880 --> 00:15:50.740
The answer is yes and it is STUNNING.

00:16:06.400 --> 00:16:10.160
This Split Rock was first discovered by Jim and Penny Caldwell,

00:16:10.440 --> 00:16:15.200
an American couple that was working
in Saudi Arabia in the early 1990's.

00:16:15.680 --> 00:16:18.960
The local Bedouins have long had two names for this area.

00:16:19.160 --> 00:16:23.280
The water of Moses and The Split Rock of Moses.

00:16:23.760 --> 00:16:26.340
This Split Rock is on top of a 100 foot hill

00:16:26.500 --> 00:16:28.940
and is somewhere between 40 and 60 feet high.

00:16:29.400 --> 00:16:35.320
And what's really amazing about this specific location
in the valley along the possible route to Mount Sinai

00:16:35.680 --> 00:16:39.540
is that the rocks underneath The Split Rock are smooth,

00:16:39.960 --> 00:16:44.920
as if tons and tons of water poured forth, forming a miniature lake at the bottom

00:16:44.920 --> 00:16:46.960
for the Israelites to drink from.

00:16:47.280 --> 00:16:52.740
If you have a relationship with a local, they'll tell you that this area is related to Moses.

00:16:52.940 --> 00:16:55.860
But the Bedouins that live here will try to keep you out.

00:16:56.280 --> 00:16:59.700
We saw this firsthand as we were chased out of the area.

00:16:59.940 --> 00:17:02.280
Okay, so we are flooring it.

00:17:03.460 --> 00:17:05.580
We're gonna see if this guy follows us.

00:17:06.220 --> 00:17:08.740
We heard two gunshots.

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:13.600
This guy's like, doesn't really want to party.

00:17:22.640 --> 00:17:27.580
The Bible says the area near The Split Rock
where the Israelites fought the Amalekites

00:17:27.740 --> 00:17:31.640
is named Rephidim, which means place of rest.

00:17:32.180 --> 00:17:34.120
Hebrew inscriptions we found there

00:17:34.340 --> 00:17:40.000
have been interpreted to say place of rest, the definition of Rephidim.

00:17:41.120 --> 00:17:47.060
Closer to the mountain, inscriptions have been found that Dr. Miles Jones, a scholar of ancient Hebrew,

00:17:47.240 --> 00:17:50.420
believes are talking about the battle with the Amalekites.

00:17:51.100 --> 00:17:55.260
He says one of the inscriptions refers to the death of an Amalekite.

00:17:55.740 --> 00:18:02.160
Nearby, there are two inscriptions that Dr. Jones believes are marking where a Hebrew mother and daughter died.

00:18:04.100 --> 00:18:10.460
The Bible says that God told the Israelites that they possess the land wherever the soles of their feet touch.

00:18:10.840 --> 00:18:17.400
Near the split rock and near the mountain, there are many inscriptions with an image of a foot and a sandal.

00:18:17.700 --> 00:18:23.580
Next to the image, there is proto-Hebrew writing that means the sole of the foot.

00:18:24.620 --> 00:18:31.380
We also found inscriptions that were translated and found to refer to Yahweh, the Hebrew name for God.

00:18:32.720 --> 00:18:38.780
There's another area near the mountain named
Wadi Musa, or the valley of Moses.

00:18:39.160 --> 00:18:45.860
Here, the depiction of a menorah was found and it might be the oldest depiction of a menorah known today.

00:18:47.780 --> 00:18:54.040
Now, a new eyewitness has come forward to reveal that the Saudis have been hiding the evidence of the Exodus

00:18:54.120 --> 00:18:56.080
since at least World War II.

00:18:56.420 --> 00:19:00.200
This man was an American pilot who met the king of Saudi Arabia.

00:19:00.500 --> 00:19:04.820
Bob Cornuke was one of the first people to reach Jabal Maqla in the 1980's

00:19:05.200 --> 00:19:09.700
and he recently interviewed that pilot and made the footage available for this video.

00:19:10.060 --> 00:19:11.360
- It's an honor to meet you.

00:19:11.520 --> 00:19:12.580
~ Thank you.

00:19:12.720 --> 00:19:18.840
- We, our lives have intersected possibly
 in something very historic

00:19:19.520 --> 00:19:24.880
and we're talking about where the real
Mount Sinai is located.

00:19:25.800 --> 00:19:31.260
And I had no idea that someone as far back 
as World War II

00:19:32.100 --> 00:19:40.180
would have seen the mountain and had been told that the mountain was the holy mountain of Moses.

00:19:40.580 --> 00:19:43.400
Did any of the Muslims tell you that
that was the holy mountain?

00:19:43.520 --> 00:19:44.400
~ Oh yes, oh yes.

00:20:08.560 --> 00:20:11.640
- But it was different than the rest of the mountains because it was black on top?

00:20:32.620 --> 00:20:35.920
Why haven't we heard about this other candidate for Mount Sinai?

00:20:36.180 --> 00:20:42.180
Why has almost the entire focus been on the traditional site despite its lack of compelling evidence?

00:20:42.420 --> 00:20:47.260
Think about how many things line up with the Biblical story right here at this mountain.

00:20:47.720 --> 00:20:52.700
There's a beach and path where the Red Sea crossing could have happened matching the Biblical account.

00:20:53.040 --> 00:20:58.180
You can see how the Israelites could have camped near Elim with it's 12 wells and 70 palms.

00:20:58.320 --> 00:21:02.980
Along the way to Jabal Maqla, there's a Split Rock
and area suitable for camping.

00:21:03.260 --> 00:21:06.280
There's a mountain referred to as the mountain of Moses

00:21:06.600 --> 00:21:10.440
with a large plain in front of it where millions of Israelites could have camped.

00:21:10.860 --> 00:21:16.400
You can see an altar of uncut stone at the foot of the mountain, where there's evidence of burnt sacrifices

00:21:16.600 --> 00:21:17.580
right where it should be.

00:21:17.900 --> 00:21:19.300
There's evidence of bull worship

00:21:19.420 --> 00:21:25.800
and you can see exactly how Moses would have seen the Golden Calf worship going on as he came down from the mountain.

00:21:26.040 --> 00:21:30.160
There's a brook that comes down from the mountain
just like the Exodus story says.

00:21:30.400 --> 00:21:33.440
You can see right where the cave of Elijah might have been.

00:21:33.840 --> 00:21:36.000
All of these little details have to fit.

00:21:36.460 --> 00:21:38.020
And they fit.

00:21:41.160 --> 00:21:46.380
After I came back from the trip, people asked how I felt standing there where so few people have been able to.

00:21:46.480 --> 00:21:48.920
And the predictable feelings were easy to describe.

00:21:49.240 --> 00:21:50.180
The adrenaline,

00:21:50.500 --> 00:21:51.260
amazement,

00:21:51.620 --> 00:21:52.200
awe.

00:21:52.720 --> 00:21:55.580
But there was an emotion that was more difficult to describe.

00:21:56.280 --> 00:21:57.860
I didn't deserve to be there.

00:21:59.140 --> 00:22:01.900
I'm not someone who's given away his wealth to the poor,

00:22:02.300 --> 00:22:04.840
I'm not a scientist or a pastor,

00:22:05.060 --> 00:22:08.080
and there are still days where I feel 
like I have no faith at all.

00:22:09.180 --> 00:22:11.660
But then as I looked at the mountains,
I remembered something.

00:22:12.460 --> 00:22:17.240
The Bible has a clear pattern where God doesn't use
the best or the most expected.

00:22:17.680 --> 00:22:20.860
Even Moses was so insecure that he didn't want the job.

00:22:21.260 --> 00:22:23.600
Rather than using the most qualified,

00:22:23.740 --> 00:22:26.480
the pattern is that God uses the unexpected,

00:22:27.720 --> 00:22:28.680
the insecure,

00:22:29.920 --> 00:22:30.780
the flawed,

00:22:31.760 --> 00:22:32.940
the depressed,

00:22:33.160 --> 00:22:33.960
the doubter,

00:22:34.840 --> 00:22:35.760
the underdog.

00:22:36.340 --> 00:22:38.780
Every single person can make a difference,

00:22:38.780 --> 00:22:41.160
especially those that think they can't.

00:22:43.400 --> 00:22:51.000
As you watch this, the Saudis are constructing a super city that is planned to be 33 times the size of New York.

00:22:51.100 --> 00:22:56.480
If all of us don't take action, Saudi construction
in the area may destroy key evidence

00:22:56.680 --> 00:22:59.660
and prevent excavation for the foreseeable future.

00:23:00.860 --> 00:23:03.600
To try to stop these sites from being threatened,

00:23:03.600 --> 00:23:08.260
we have set up a website and a nonprofit organization
to support further research

00:23:08.300 --> 00:23:13.400
and to convince the Saudis to preserve the sites
so they can be saved and investigated.

00:23:13.480 --> 00:23:16.120
We're entering a period we've never been in before,

00:23:16.240 --> 00:23:20.580
one where this footage and other evidence of the Exodus and the Bible overall

00:23:20.580 --> 00:23:24.200
are only a click away for anyone on Earth with an internet connection.

00:23:24.560 --> 00:23:26.680
And as these sites are revealed,

00:23:26.840 --> 00:23:29.420
it will change the Middle East forever

00:23:29.520 --> 00:23:34.740
and impact the billions of people who follow
Judaism, Christianity, Islam,

00:23:34.760 --> 00:23:36.660
and those with no faith at all.

00:23:38.140 --> 00:23:40.660
The world is about to change.
