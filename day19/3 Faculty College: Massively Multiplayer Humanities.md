TOM MULLANEY: My name is Tom Mullaney and I teach in the history department here at Stanford. And the project that I've been working on with VPTL and my colleagues is called Massively Multiplayer Humanities. And the `centerpiece` of the program, or MMH, is to scale up the experience of hands-on archive-based, object-based learning in the humanities for undergraduates. It's been a wonderful success. And in our minds and in the minds of our students, it's a proof of concept that this kind of learning is not limited to small courses and can be brought into classes as large as 30 students, 60 students, 100 students, even 150 students. The main question in terms of `pedagogy` is actually manifold. The first is, how do you treat an undergraduate with or without experience in a particular major to behave like and inhabit the role of a professional scholar? So how do you conduct yourself? How do you-- whether research or the kinds of conversations, the way that colleagues, the way that instructors do in their professional lives? 

Well, I think that this program would not have been possible in the precise way it happened without Faculty College as a framework. The faculty and librarians and curators work together all the time, but it tends to be on a one-on-one small-scale basis. Faculty College made it possible for a group of seven of us to collaborate in a long-term way over the course of this academic year, which was absolutely essential to building out the program to its full capacity and also to think in a more systematic way beyond one course or two courses towards the question which we have attempted to answer, how is this scalable and transportable across n number of courses, an undetermined number of courses? And that was something that a one-on-one informal collaboration couldn't have made possible. So that's what I'm especially indebted to Faculty College and VPTL for.
