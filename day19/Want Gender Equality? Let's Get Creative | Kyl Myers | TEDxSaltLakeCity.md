00:00:09.416 --> 00:00:13.447
I want you to channel
your nine-year-old self,

00:00:13.447 --> 00:00:17.606
and I'm going to ask you
a very important question.

00:00:18.258 --> 00:00:20.935
"Hey, you, nine-year-old,

00:00:20.935 --> 00:00:23.653
what do you want to be when you grow up?"

00:00:24.551 --> 00:00:26.127
Do you remember?

00:00:27.187 --> 00:00:29.094
Did it come true?

00:00:29.977 --> 00:00:33.899
When I was nine, I wanted to be
a Spice Girls understudy.

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:34.959
(Laughter)

00:00:34.959 --> 00:00:37.115
I would have been bowl-cut-perm Spice.

00:00:37.115 --> 00:00:39.676
(Laughter)

00:00:41.279 --> 00:00:44.458
This Spice Girl thing
didn't work out for me.

00:00:44.458 --> 00:00:47.579
Instead, I became a social scientist,

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:51.659
and over the last decade,
I've been studying gender inequality,

00:00:51.659 --> 00:00:54.381
and there is a whole lot of it.

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:59.689
What if, when we asked kids what
they wanted to be when they grow up,

00:00:59.689 --> 00:01:03.164
they told us the other possibilities
that awaited them?

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:06.351
What if little boys said,

00:01:07.071 --> 00:01:09.983
"I'll have a higher risk of skin cancer,"

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:15.513
"Ill be treated like
a less competent parent,"

00:01:17.412 --> 00:01:20.714
"I'll have a higher risk
of being incarcerated"?

00:01:23.397 --> 00:01:25.833
And what if little girls told us,

00:01:26.623 --> 00:01:29.684
"I might struggle 
with an eating disorder,"

00:01:31.283 --> 00:01:34.637
"I won't have a lot
of political role models,"

00:01:35.974 --> 00:01:39.790
"I'll get paid less,
just because I'm a girl"?

00:01:42.164 --> 00:01:45.853
And what if gender-
non-conforming kids told us,

00:01:45.853 --> 00:01:48.860
"I'll probably be bullied by my peers,"

00:01:50.034 --> 00:01:52.881
"I might get kicked out of my house,"

00:01:54.403 --> 00:01:59.030
"I won't feel safe using the toilet
when I'm out in public"?

00:02:01.246 --> 00:02:04.546
These are the realities
that children are facing

00:02:04.546 --> 00:02:07.663
because these are the realities
that adults are facing.

00:02:08.834 --> 00:02:11.793
I have three messages for you today.

00:02:11.793 --> 00:02:16.341
The first is there are real
and harmful gender disparities

00:02:16.341 --> 00:02:18.505
experienced by adults.

00:02:19.175 --> 00:02:23.828
The second is these disparities
are rooted in childhood.

00:02:24.984 --> 00:02:30.118
And the third is we have the power
to do something about it.

00:02:32.687 --> 00:02:37.687
There are gender inequalities
in virtually every aspect of adult life:

00:02:37.687 --> 00:02:40.347
in relationships, at home,

00:02:40.347 --> 00:02:43.654
at work, at church, in politics,

00:02:43.654 --> 00:02:46.516
in health, even the Olympics.

00:02:47.185 --> 00:02:50.268
These disparities start with stereotypes,

00:02:50.268 --> 00:02:52.810
assumptions that there's
one way to be woman

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:54.570
and there's one way to be a man,

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:58.765
and men and women might as well
be from different planets.

00:03:00.143 --> 00:03:03.917
The reason men are more likely
to get skin cancer

00:03:03.917 --> 00:03:08.414
is because men just have
a weaker skin than women, right?

00:03:09.065 --> 00:03:10.295
No.

00:03:10.649 --> 00:03:14.062
In large part, it's because
men are socialized

00:03:14.062 --> 00:03:20.150
to take on "masculine" jobs and hobbies,
such as construction or agricultural work,

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:23.900
and sports that tend to be outside,
exposed to the sun.

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:30.286
Lotion, including sunscreen,
is marketed as a feminized product

00:03:30.286 --> 00:03:33.740
and is in conflict
with stereotypes of masculinity,

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:40.056
which values risk, danger, and ruggedness
above cautionary behavior,

00:03:40.582 --> 00:03:43.152
the same stereotypes
that lead to lower rates

00:03:43.152 --> 00:03:45.959
of seat belt and helmet use among men

00:03:45.959 --> 00:03:50.523
and higher rates of injury
and accident-related deaths.

00:03:51.523 --> 00:03:53.823
Once men have skin cancer,

00:03:53.823 --> 00:03:57.114
they're more likely
than women to die from it.

00:03:58.683 --> 00:04:01.642
A cornerstone of masculinity is,

00:04:01.642 --> 00:04:05.117
"Don't show that you are
scared or hurting.

00:04:05.117 --> 00:04:09.349
Making an appointment
with a doctor does just that."

00:04:12.234 --> 00:04:16.033
Women in America
make an average of 79 cents

00:04:16.033 --> 00:04:18.485
for every dollar earned by men.

00:04:18.485 --> 00:04:21.085
Even though women
earn more college degrees,

00:04:21.085 --> 00:04:23.254
they're offered lower starting salaries

00:04:23.254 --> 00:04:26.165
and they're less likely
to negotiate for more,

00:04:26.165 --> 00:04:31.515
and women with children aren't promoted
as often as men with children.

00:04:31.515 --> 00:04:37.371
Women are missing out on nearly
half a million dollars in their lifetime.

00:04:38.975 --> 00:04:44.638
A cornerstone of femininity is,
"Don't show that you are assertive.

00:04:44.638 --> 00:04:47.789
Be grateful for what you're offered!
Don't rock the boat!

00:04:47.789 --> 00:04:51.259
Women should not
be difficult to work with."

00:04:52.996 --> 00:04:58.651
Gender inequalities don't magically appear
after high school graduation.

00:04:58.651 --> 00:05:03.658
Gender socialization
and gender policing begin much earlier,

00:05:03.658 --> 00:05:06.400
well before kindergarten graduation.

00:05:07.528 --> 00:05:11.596
The perpetuation of gender stereotypes
occurs throughout childhood,

00:05:11.596 --> 00:05:14.230
and since the development
of ultrasound technology,

00:05:14.230 --> 00:05:16.432
it begins in utero.

00:05:16.968 --> 00:05:21.669
From birth, children are taught
the social and cultural norms

00:05:21.669 --> 00:05:25.606
that are expected of them
based on their anatomy,

00:05:26.051 --> 00:05:28.599
but what those social
and cultural norms are

00:05:28.599 --> 00:05:31.747
varies by time and place.

00:05:32.881 --> 00:05:37.540
Boys are conditioned to take risks,
and be athletic and competitive.

00:05:37.540 --> 00:05:41.431
Girls are conditioned
to value appearance over ambition,

00:05:41.431 --> 00:05:44.239
and to put others before themselves.

00:05:44.239 --> 00:05:47.230
And when it comes
to gender-non-conforming kids,

00:05:47.230 --> 00:05:52.133
gender-bending girls are often
celebrated and called tomboys,

00:05:52.133 --> 00:05:58.036
while gender-bending boys
are often shamed and called sissies.

00:06:00.393 --> 00:06:04.902
The masculine and feminine paths
are not complementary.

00:06:04.902 --> 00:06:07.371
Rather, they're hierarchical,

00:06:07.371 --> 00:06:13.032
with boys and men being valued
and more powerful than girls and women.

00:06:13.622 --> 00:06:17.363
Boys learn early that getting hurt
is part of being a boy:

00:06:17.363 --> 00:06:20.363
"Brush yourself off! Don't cry! Be a man!

00:06:20.363 --> 00:06:23.073
And put that doll down! That's for girls!

00:06:23.073 --> 00:06:26.323
But make sure in 30 years
you're a really good dad."

00:06:26.323 --> 00:06:27.877
(Laughter)

00:06:29.243 --> 00:06:32.355
Remember that half a million dollars
women miss out on?

00:06:32.355 --> 00:06:37.317
That's not including the lost cash
during childhood and adolescence.

00:06:37.883 --> 00:06:43.083
Boys do about 45 minutes of chores
for every hour that girls do.

00:06:43.083 --> 00:06:49.134
Yet, boys are 15% more likely
to get paid for the chores they do.

00:06:49.134 --> 00:06:51.656
And when girls do get paid allowance,

00:06:51.656 --> 00:06:56.273
they're pocketing about 73 cents
on the boys' dollar.

00:06:56.685 --> 00:06:58.454
Sound familiar?

00:06:59.475 --> 00:07:03.238
Childhood gender inequalities
are growing up

00:07:03.238 --> 00:07:06.361
to be adulthood gender inequalities.

00:07:06.361 --> 00:07:10.055
We're trying to fix the problem
when it's too late,

00:07:10.055 --> 00:07:14.443
but how can we eliminate the problem
before it even begins?

00:07:15.055 --> 00:07:18.946
First, we have to ask ourselves
some questions.

00:07:21.283 --> 00:07:25.748
Why do we ask pregnant people,
"Are you having a boy or a girl?"

00:07:26.952 --> 00:07:31.192
Because we think boys and girls
require different things?

00:07:32.597 --> 00:07:38.512
Is knowledge of a person's genitals
the foundation of how we treat them?

00:07:40.789 --> 00:07:45.188
The reason expecting parents
have to wait until around week 16

00:07:45.188 --> 00:07:47.740
to find out "what" they're having

00:07:47.740 --> 00:07:51.599
is because, prior to that time,
fetuses don't look different.

00:07:51.599 --> 00:07:55.148
In utero, everyone starts out the same.

00:07:55.788 --> 00:08:00.590
Around week 10 of gestation,
a fetus with a Y sex chromosome

00:08:00.590 --> 00:08:03.381
will typically begin
producing testosterone,

00:08:03.381 --> 00:08:08.200
and their genitalia will typically
differentiate into testes and a penis,

00:08:08.200 --> 00:08:10.594
instead of ovaries and a vagina.

00:08:11.729 --> 00:08:15.923
About half of babies
have XX sex chromosomes

00:08:15.923 --> 00:08:17.954
and are labeled female.

00:08:17.954 --> 00:08:21.582
About half of babies
have XY sex chromosomes

00:08:21.582 --> 00:08:23.325
and are labeled male.

00:08:23.934 --> 00:08:28.146
Other babies are born
with intersex variations.

00:08:29.082 --> 00:08:34.674
Those with intersex traits are born
with internal and/or external genitalia

00:08:34.674 --> 00:08:38.403
that may be different
than what we might typically expect,

00:08:38.403 --> 00:08:43.983
but biological sex
is a spectrum, not a binary.

00:08:43.983 --> 00:08:47.712
And male and female babies
aren't very different at all.

00:08:47.712 --> 00:08:54.123
In fact, there's more variation
among male babies and among female babies

00:08:54.123 --> 00:08:57.703
than there is between male
and female babies.

00:09:01.012 --> 00:09:03.216
In an enlightening study,

00:09:03.216 --> 00:09:07.892
researchers placed eleven-month-old
infants on a platform with a sloped ramp,

00:09:07.892 --> 00:09:10.244
and they watched the babies crawl.

00:09:10.244 --> 00:09:15.514
Male and female babies showed
identical levels of motor performance.

00:09:15.514 --> 00:09:20.246
What differed was their mothers'
estimations of their crawling abilities.

00:09:20.246 --> 00:09:24.326
Mothers of girls underestimated
their daughters' performance,

00:09:24.326 --> 00:09:28.932
and mothers of boys overestimated
their sons' performance.

00:09:30.024 --> 00:09:35.895
The physical, verbal and emotional
differences we see between boys and girls

00:09:35.895 --> 00:09:41.711
are largely socially constructed
and reinforced through stereotypes.

00:09:43.380 --> 00:09:48.287
What if we had the same mindset
about sex chromosomes

00:09:48.287 --> 00:09:51.376
as we do any other aspect 
of someone's DNA,

00:09:51.376 --> 00:09:56.217
like their hair or eye color,
that they don't really matter?

00:09:56.217 --> 00:09:59.717
Green-eyed people aren't sent down
dramatically different careers paths

00:09:59.717 --> 00:10:01.487
than brown-eyed people.

00:10:01.997 --> 00:10:05.668
There aren't different racks of clothing
for blonds and brunettes.

00:10:06.179 --> 00:10:09.039
We don't have reveal parties
where people make bets

00:10:09.039 --> 00:10:12.647
on a fetus's attached
or detached earlobes.

00:10:12.647 --> 00:10:14.647
(Laughter)

00:10:15.960 --> 00:10:20.615
What if, instead of treating
boys and girls dramatically different,

00:10:20.615 --> 00:10:24.800
we tried to `instill` in them
well-`rounded`, positive traits,

00:10:24.800 --> 00:10:27.979
like kindness, a sense of adventure,

00:10:27.979 --> 00:10:32.270
compassion, critical thinking,
and comedic timing,

00:10:32.270 --> 00:10:37.111
qualities we don't think tall or short
people are more or less capable of?

00:10:38.173 --> 00:10:42.223
Most of us want a world
without gender inequality,

00:10:42.223 --> 00:10:45.551
but it's going to take us all
being honest with ourselves

00:10:45.551 --> 00:10:48.278
about how we reinforce it.

00:10:48.278 --> 00:10:52.841
If equality is what we want,
we have to create it.

00:10:54.181 --> 00:10:58.013
Not long ago, something
changed inside of me,

00:10:58.013 --> 00:10:59.506
quite literally.

00:11:00.232 --> 00:11:01.814
I was pregnant.

00:11:02.353 --> 00:11:05.501
And pregnancy and impending parenthood

00:11:05.501 --> 00:11:08.683
made me think differently
about the world I studied,

00:11:08.683 --> 00:11:11.571
the world my child would be entering.

00:11:13.672 --> 00:11:16.742
I considered all of the information I had

00:11:16.742 --> 00:11:20.293
about the harmful impacts
of gender inequality,

00:11:20.293 --> 00:11:24.854
and I understood that my child's
gender identity would be up to them,

00:11:24.854 --> 00:11:26.315
not me.

00:11:27.353 --> 00:11:32.234
I couldn't stomach the idea of placing
my kid in the girl box or the boy box,

00:11:32.234 --> 00:11:36.489
and then sending them down a path
that I knew could be constraining.

00:11:38.275 --> 00:11:41.487
I thought to myself,
"Wouldn't it be great

00:11:41.487 --> 00:11:46.216
if we could opt our kids out
of gender stereotypes?"

00:11:46.906 --> 00:11:49.363
And the more I thought about it,

00:11:49.363 --> 00:11:53.247
this fantasy turned into a possibility,

00:11:53.247 --> 00:11:57.666
and then, this possibility
turned into a reality.

00:11:58.355 --> 00:12:04.636
I am now the very proud,
very smitten parent

00:12:04.636 --> 00:12:06.834
of Zoomer Coyote.

00:12:09.376 --> 00:12:14.813
My husband and I decided
to raise Zoomer to be gender-creative.

00:12:14.813 --> 00:12:17.148
We didn't assign a gender to Zoomer,

00:12:17.148 --> 00:12:20.258
and we don't disclose their sex,
unless it's necessary,

00:12:20.258 --> 00:12:24.455
and we use the gender neutral pronouns
"they," "them," and "their."

00:12:24.938 --> 00:12:30.199
Like all babies, Zoomer needs food,
and sleep, and clothes,

00:12:30.199 --> 00:12:34.720
and love, and attention,
and so many diapers,

00:12:35.820 --> 00:12:39.450
but we're giving Zoomer
the freedom and encouragement

00:12:39.450 --> 00:12:41.280
to explore their interests,

00:12:41.280 --> 00:12:46.449
and eventually self-identity
as a girl, or a boy,

00:12:46.449 --> 00:12:49.499
or any other label they think fits.

00:12:49.499 --> 00:12:53.977
We trust that Zoomer
will know who they are,

00:12:53.977 --> 00:12:57.451
just like everyone in this room
knows who they are.

00:12:58.700 --> 00:13:00.611
In the meantime,

00:13:00.611 --> 00:13:04.262
Zoomer doesn't experience
an onslaught of gender stereotypes,

00:13:04.262 --> 00:13:08.291
or social expectations, or restrictions
based on their anatomy.

00:13:08.291 --> 00:13:10.794
Zoomer isn't treated like a boy or a girl.

00:13:10.794 --> 00:13:13.341
Zoomer is treated like a child,

00:13:13.341 --> 00:13:16.132
a child who deserves
to never hear the words,

00:13:16.132 --> 00:13:17.783
"That's not for boys!,"

00:13:17.783 --> 00:13:20.169
or, "That's not for girls!"

00:13:20.752 --> 00:13:26.121
Zoomer is taught
that everything is for everyone.

00:13:28.432 --> 00:13:33.006
There are very few hardfast rules
about the world we live in,

00:13:33.006 --> 00:13:36.673
and children are accepting,
curious creatures

00:13:36.673 --> 00:13:39.904
who trust us to answer their questions.

00:13:39.904 --> 00:13:41.124
You do realize!

00:13:41.124 --> 00:13:45.294
We can tell kids anything,
and they are likely to believe us,

00:13:45.294 --> 00:13:50.385
which means we get to teach kids
about the world we wish for them.

00:13:50.385 --> 00:13:56.325
Gender inequalities cannot exist
if they are not perpetuated.

00:13:58.142 --> 00:14:01.572
So, the next time you're interacting
with a female child,

00:14:01.572 --> 00:14:04.636
forgo a compliment about her appearance.

00:14:04.636 --> 00:14:07.594
Instead, ask her what book she last read.

00:14:07.594 --> 00:14:10.236
Ask her to tell you
about her favorite planet.

00:14:10.236 --> 00:14:13.718
Allow her to take risks
and scrape her knees.

00:14:14.353 --> 00:14:17.209
The next time you're interacting
with a male child,

00:14:17.209 --> 00:14:19.414
validate his fears.

00:14:19.816 --> 00:14:23.157
Give him the opportunity
to share his emotions,

00:14:23.157 --> 00:14:25.921
and engage in caretaking activities.

00:14:26.516 --> 00:14:29.919
Introduce him to a female role model.

00:14:30.347 --> 00:14:33.420
Ask him if he wants
his fingernails painted.

00:14:34.258 --> 00:14:36.158
We can create a world

00:14:36.158 --> 00:14:41.918
where we genuinely value
individuality above conformity.

00:14:42.558 --> 00:14:44.536
And we can create a world

00:14:44.536 --> 00:14:49.797
where everyone grows up to be equal.

00:14:50.676 --> 00:14:51.898
Thank you.

00:14:51.898 --> 00:14:54.898
(Applause) (Cheers)
