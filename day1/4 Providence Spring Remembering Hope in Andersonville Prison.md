Water is essential to life. But what gives can also take away. At Andersonville prisoners turned into a narrow stream and collected rainwater for drinking. As the `stockade` population exploded, this stream became a `quagmire` of mud, `stagnant` water, &amp; human waste. The polluted water claimed thousands of lives with no relief in sight. During the second week of August 1864, 33,000 prisoners nervously watched as `ominous` clouds rolled in. The rain began slowly, but quickly became a `deluge` that `saturated` thousand struggling for shelter underneath `wool` blankets and lean-to's. A flash flood destroyed a section of the `stockade` wall and cannon shots rang out, calling the guards to their posts. The prisoners could do little but `huddle` together soaking wet and cold. A few days later as the rain `subsided`, prisoners found along the deadline in the `eroded` hillside a spring of freshwater They began using sticks in cups to reach across the water and soon a `trough` was built that funneled the clean water into the stockade. Some, believing that the appearance of the spring to be a miracle of God, began calling it `Providence Spring`. Within a month the springs appearance the majority of the prisoners were `evacuated` to other `facilities`. but stories of Providence Spring quickly spread. One of the first written accounts of the spring came from Clara Barton in her report the army's `expedition` to the site. By the early 1900s story emerged that lightning struck inside the prison stockade and that a spring burst forth in a tremendous geyser. This account `reinforce` the belief that the prisoners were `spared` through `divine` intervention. In 1901, the Woman's Relief Corps &amp; Andersonville survivors `dedicated` a Spring House making Providence Spring the only feature inside the stockade walls to be preserved. For 150 years Providence Spring has been an important stop for visitors to Andersonville. For previous generations, no trip to Andersonville was complete without taking a sip from the spring Today Providence Spring is a place where visitors can touch and feel the cool waters that gave life and hope to thousands of Americans.
