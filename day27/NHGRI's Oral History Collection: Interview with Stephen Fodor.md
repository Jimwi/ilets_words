00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:16.470
&gt;&gt; Stephen Fodor
My name's Stephen Fodor and currently I

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:24.470
head a little biotech group in Palo Alto
where we're exploring new technologies.

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:27.570
You know, it wasn't a straight path.

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:34.539
And you know, my dad in the early years
-- I grew up in the late '50s, early

00:00:34.539 --> 00:00:36.690
'60s in Seattle.

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:41.510
My dad was a physician
and so he always, you know, made sure

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:47.649
that there were, you know, microscopes
and telescopes and chemistry sets and

00:00:47.649 --> 00:00:51.670
would bring me home blood smears from
his office and stuff like that, x-rays.

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:57.059
So, we had a house that had a lot of
science in it.

00:00:57.059 --> 00:00:59.260
So, you know, I sort of
did that.

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:03.020
I actually -- when I
graduated from high school, I was not

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:05.190
going to go into science.

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:10.189
It was in the
late '60s and so I was actually somewhat

00:01:10.189 --> 00:01:16.630
of an anti-establishment type rebel and
decided I was going to go live out in

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:17.640
the country.

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:20.299
And so, I did not go to
college right after high school.

00:01:20.299 --> 00:01:26.140
I went to Eastern Washington and
actually worked on a potato farm and

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:32.030
grew potatoes for a year or two with a
farmer there.

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:38.119
And one day, I was with
the farmer and, you know, we went

00:01:38.119 --> 00:01:42.930
through the whole process of planting,
`irrigating`, `harvesting`, and sorting all

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:45.500
the potatoes, putting them into bags.

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:49.350
And a guy in a truck drives up and the
farmer sells them to the guy in the

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:54.259
truck for 35 cents a bag and he drives
them to the store and sells them for 70

00:01:54.259 --> 00:01:55.259
cents.

00:01:55.259 --> 00:02:02.380
And so, I said to the farmer, I
said, "Well, why don't you buy a truck?"

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:04.810
And he didn't want to step on the
middleman and all this.

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:07.700
And so, you
know, I thought to myself right then

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:12.280
that, you know, if this is really the
way the world is, you know, I should go

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:13.689
to college.

00:02:13.689 --> 00:02:15.060
And so, I was going to be a
farmer.

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:17.340
That's what I thought I was
going to do.

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:23.019
And plus, I was pretty
tired of working hard labor.

00:02:23.019 --> 00:02:30.239
But I went to college and then, you
know, started to take some agriculture

00:02:30.239 --> 00:02:35.629
classes and got totally disillusioned
with the courses.

00:02:35.629 --> 00:02:38.359
They sort of taught
by repetition.

00:02:38.359 --> 00:02:40.230
And so, I was going to
drop out.

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:43.699
And my dad told me, "Well,
don't drop out.

00:02:43.699 --> 00:02:45.819
Just take courses that
are interesting to you."

00:02:45.819 --> 00:02:47.779
And so, I
started to take a lot of biology,

00:02:47.779 --> 00:02:53.129
chemistry, and math courses and got very
much interested in science at that

00:02:53.129 --> 00:02:54.129
point.

00:02:54.129 --> 00:03:01.189
Well, you know, I came to the end of my
undergraduate work and had to declare a

00:03:01.189 --> 00:03:02.189
major.

00:03:02.189 --> 00:03:05.190
And so, my first major was in
biology actually.

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:09.540
And part of that was
to complete a senior project, senior

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:12.189
thesis-like program.

00:03:12.189 --> 00:03:16.279
And I met a guy
named Arthur Cohen, who actually ran the

00:03:16.279 --> 00:03:23.519
electron microscopy section at
Washington State, which is where I was.

00:03:23.519 --> 00:03:32.689
And, you know, they had an electron
microscopy facility and electron

00:03:32.689 --> 00:03:37.769
microscopes that were totally accessible
to undergraduates.

00:03:37.769 --> 00:03:40.019
And so, I started to
learn how to use those.

00:03:40.019 --> 00:03:44.040
And it was just
fascinating being able to, you know,

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:48.370
take a sample that you could see with
your eye and then, you know, end up

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:54.730
magnifying it 700,000 fold to get down
to pretty much the limit of what you

00:03:54.730 --> 00:03:59.680
could do with electron microscopy, which
was in the 10 angstrom or so, you know,

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:03.309
20 angstrom range back then.

00:04:03.309 --> 00:04:06.979
And so,
that was fantastic to me.

00:04:06.979 --> 00:04:14.919
And then I met -- I was looking for my
project, some DNA because I wanted to

00:04:14.919 --> 00:04:18.079
try this technique that was called the
Kleinschmidt Technique at the time,

00:04:18.079 --> 00:04:25.020
which was basically floating DNA on the
surface interface between a layer of

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:34.520
cytochrome C, I believe, and the
meniscus of a bubble and put it again on

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:37.490
an electron microscope grid.

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:40.400
And I
started calling different people and I

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:44.669
ended up finding a guy names Keith
Dunker, who was in the biochemistry

00:04:44.669 --> 00:04:47.580
department at WSU.

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:55.569
And he gave me some
samples of bacteriophage FD or M13,

00:04:55.569 --> 00:04:58.740
which is the same thing.

00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:01.169
He gave those
to me and said, "Come on back if you get

00:05:01.169 --> 00:05:02.300
anything."

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:06.120
And so, I did them and I got
these gorgeous micrographs and I brought

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:07.509
them back to him.

00:05:07.509 --> 00:05:10.259
And as I walked in
and showed it to him, he said, "Do you

00:05:10.259 --> 00:05:14.300
want a job?' because apparently, they
had been trying for months to get some

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:16.050
good photographs.

00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:19.789
And so, he got me interested in this.

00:05:19.789 --> 00:05:23.770
I
stayed at WSU and got a master's in

00:05:23.770 --> 00:05:26.879
biochemistry and biophysics.

00:05:26.879 --> 00:05:31.199
During
that period, I also met a fellow by the

00:05:31.199 --> 00:05:39.069
name of Paul Stein, who was a visiting
scientist there from the east coast.

00:05:39.069 --> 00:05:44.919
And Paul was sort of an expert in laser
resonance Raman spectroscopy.

00:05:44.919 --> 00:05:46.460
And so, I
started to learn from him.

00:05:46.460 --> 00:05:51.689
This was in
the days where the first sort of

00:05:51.689 --> 00:05:56.539
commercial research lasers were becoming
available.

00:05:56.539 --> 00:06:00.460
And so, you know, he taught
me a lot about how to work with lasers,

00:06:00.460 --> 00:06:02.810
how to do some spectroscopy.

00:06:02.810 --> 00:06:06.590
And that
became the basis for my work when I

00:06:06.590 --> 00:06:09.030
applied to graduate school.

00:06:09.030 --> 00:06:13.900
At graduate school, I went to Princeton
in Tom Sparrow's [spelled phonetically]

00:06:13.900 --> 00:06:14.900
lab.

00:06:14.900 --> 00:06:20.639
He was an expert in resonance
Raman of hemoglobin.

00:06:20.639 --> 00:06:26.129
But we also at the
time -- he had been getting some of

00:06:26.129 --> 00:06:34.710
these new pulse lasers, these yag-lasers
[spelled phonetically], at the time.

00:06:34.710 --> 00:06:40.840
And he wanted to do some new work in the
ultra-violet realm.

00:06:40.840 --> 00:06:43.639
And so, I started
to work with actually a guy named Rich

00:06:43.639 --> 00:06:49.870
Rava, who I became close friends with
and worked for many years.

00:06:49.870 --> 00:06:54.419
But we had
some of the first ultra-violet laser

00:06:54.419 --> 00:07:01.749
light at the time for again, for
biomolecular research.

00:07:01.749 --> 00:07:04.669
And we did some
of the earliest work on proteins and

00:07:04.669 --> 00:07:12.439
nucleic acids by excitation of the
chromophores, both nucleic acids and

00:07:12.439 --> 00:07:17.449
amino acids, back in the early 80s.

00:07:17.449 --> 00:07:22.400
And
so, you know, Tom Sparrow, whose lab we

00:07:22.400 --> 00:07:28.860
were in, his -- that was my first
exposure to a very large lab.

00:07:28.860 --> 00:07:32.210
There
were probably a dozen graduate students

00:07:32.210 --> 00:07:35.479
and probably a dozen post-docs.

00:07:35.479 --> 00:07:36.540
We had
a big facility.

00:07:36.540 --> 00:07:40.520
But it was there that I
really learned, you know, starting to do

00:07:40.520 --> 00:07:44.400
some innovative things had a big payoff.

00:07:44.400 --> 00:07:49.889
By doing these first early experiments
on nucleic acid proteins, we then put in

00:07:49.889 --> 00:07:52.400
some grant applications for Tom.

00:07:52.400 --> 00:07:54.240
And
so, that started a whole new funding

00:07:54.240 --> 00:07:56.240
cycle for Tom's lab.

00:07:56.240 --> 00:08:01.719
And you know, these were actually, I
thought, pretty easy experiments.

00:08:01.719 --> 00:08:05.220
Because when you get to do it for the
first time, you always break a lot of

00:08:05.220 --> 00:08:06.220
ground.

00:08:06.220 --> 00:08:08.639
So, you know, I very much
enjoyed it.

00:08:08.639 --> 00:08:10.039
I always enjoyed working
with my hands.

00:08:10.039 --> 00:08:13.979
I enjoyed experiments
and making things work.

00:08:13.979 --> 00:08:17.779
And so, this
was a big lesson for me, you know, as

00:08:17.779 --> 00:08:20.970
well as moving from a place like WSU to
Princeton.

00:08:20.970 --> 00:08:24.490
The exposure was much, much
larger at Princeton.

00:08:24.490 --> 00:08:28.120
But the exposure
to the larger lab, the lessons that if

00:08:28.120 --> 00:08:34.490
you're innovative, you develop a new
technique or new data, it opens new

00:08:34.490 --> 00:08:35.590
doors for you.

00:08:35.590 --> 00:08:38.979
And so, that was a real
eye opener for me.

00:08:38.979 --> 00:08:43.740
So, at Princeton, when I completed
there, you know, we had done some very

00:08:43.740 --> 00:08:45.600
nice work.

00:08:45.600 --> 00:08:49.410
I was applying for post-docs
and I really wanted to go out to a guy

00:08:49.410 --> 00:08:51.500
named Rich Matthew's lab at Berkley.

00:08:51.500 --> 00:08:55.920
And so, I applied there, and Rich said,
"Yeah, you can come."

00:08:55.920 --> 00:08:58.040
And but, the
moment I got there he said, "Well, you

00:08:58.040 --> 00:08:59.440
have to get your own money now."

00:08:59.440 --> 00:09:04.250
And
so, I applied for an NIH fellowship at

00:09:04.250 --> 00:09:05.250
that time.

00:09:05.250 --> 00:09:09.150
And I was working -- at that
time, I had already had experience in

00:09:09.150 --> 00:09:14.889
pulsed lasers, that experience with
generating, you know, ultraviolet lasers

00:09:14.889 --> 00:09:16.230
and light.

00:09:16.230 --> 00:09:24.149
And Rich had been working on
time resolves spectroscopy, particularly

00:09:24.149 --> 00:09:27.950
of bacterial and plant pigments.

00:09:27.950 --> 00:09:29.800
And
so, I took on a couple projects.

00:09:29.800 --> 00:09:31.630
One
was in bacterial rhodopsin and another

00:09:31.630 --> 00:09:37.170
halo rhodopsin and another sensory
rhodopsin and finally phytochrome, one

00:09:37.170 --> 00:09:41.540
of the plant pigments, over my post-doc
time there.

00:09:41.540 --> 00:09:47.910
But we -- I'd learned a lot
more about very, very high sensitivity

00:09:47.910 --> 00:09:50.550
detection at that point.

00:09:50.550 --> 00:09:53.100
And you know,
and this is a little bit of a prelude to

00:09:53.100 --> 00:09:58.370
what we'll get into, but I was working
in Raman spectroscopy, which is orders

00:09:58.370 --> 00:10:02.209
of magnitude less signal that you get,
for example, with fluorescence

00:10:02.209 --> 00:10:03.290
spectroscopy.

00:10:03.290 --> 00:10:06.699
And so, I'd learned, you
know, on probably some of the hardest

00:10:06.699 --> 00:10:08.509
problems at the time.

00:10:08.509 --> 00:10:12.730
And in addition,
I started to get a good background on

00:10:12.730 --> 00:10:13.959
photochemistry there.

00:10:13.959 --> 00:10:18.250
So, you know, it
was a combination of being able to work

00:10:18.250 --> 00:10:24.310
with light, being able to work with
biological molecules, understand high

00:10:24.310 --> 00:10:29.959
sensitivity detection, and also
photochemistry.

00:10:29.959 --> 00:10:34.470
After working on that for a while, my
ambition was to go into academics.

00:10:34.470 --> 00:10:41.060
So,
I applied to a few academic spots and

00:10:41.060 --> 00:10:43.470
got a couple of interviews.

00:10:43.470 --> 00:10:45.820
Turned out
to be number second choice in both of

00:10:45.820 --> 00:10:46.820
those.

00:10:46.820 --> 00:10:49.600
And so, I was going to stay for
another year at Berkley and then

00:10:49.600 --> 00:10:51.209
reapply.

00:10:51.209 --> 00:10:54.399
And it was during that period
that I actually got a call from Lubert

00:10:54.399 --> 00:11:00.480
Stryer, who was at Stanford, and of
course Lubert is a very famous scientist

00:11:00.480 --> 00:11:04.180
that not only wrote the textbook on
biochemistry that was used by

00:11:04.180 --> 00:11:07.509
practically every medical student for
years.

00:11:07.509 --> 00:11:13.440
But, you know, Lubert had done
this very nice work in the biochemistry

00:11:13.440 --> 00:11:22.529
and photochemistry of retinal, of
rhodopsin in site, in vision.

00:11:22.529 --> 00:11:24.649
And in
addition, had done some very innovative

00:11:24.649 --> 00:11:33.360
things with avoid strep dowden system
for fluorescent tagging, done some work

00:11:33.360 --> 00:11:37.839
with the -- he was very well known for
his work with the forcer energy transfer

00:11:37.839 --> 00:11:42.399
experiments of measuring distances by
energy transfer with fluorescent

00:11:42.399 --> 00:11:44.550
molecules.

00:11:44.550 --> 00:11:50.750
And you know, so when Lubert
called, I listened.

00:11:50.750 --> 00:11:53.399
And we chatted,
but, you know, he said, "Well, I'm going

00:11:53.399 --> 00:11:58.250
to take a year leave of absence from
Stanford to start this little company

00:11:58.250 --> 00:12:02.720
called Affymax and I'd like someone with
your background to come joint me."

00:12:02.720 --> 00:12:08.180
He said, "Look, you know, if you stay
for a year, if it doesn't work out,

00:12:08.180 --> 00:12:11.800
then, you know, we'll see about, you
know, where is a good spot for you,"

00:12:11.800 --> 00:12:12.800
sort of thing.

00:12:12.800 --> 00:12:15.720
And so, I thought,
"Well, okay."

00:12:15.720 --> 00:12:21.130
And so, I went down to
this little company called Affymax.

00:12:21.130 --> 00:12:23.529
And
you know, I have to say my motivations

00:12:23.529 --> 00:12:26.090
were really to go and do some science.

00:12:26.090 --> 00:12:31.940
My motivations were not at all to create
a new company nor to necessarily even go

00:12:31.940 --> 00:12:34.720
after what the ambitions of the company
were.

00:12:34.720 --> 00:12:39.889
I was invited by Lubert and you
know, the prospect of doing some great

00:12:39.889 --> 00:12:42.089
science I thought was great.

00:12:42.089 --> 00:12:48.910
But when I got down there, there was
this guy named Alex Zaffaroni, who was a

00:12:48.910 --> 00:12:55.750
well-known biotechnology entrepreneur in
Silicon Valley.

00:12:55.750 --> 00:13:00.720
He had worked on
companies like DNAX, earlier -- I've

00:13:00.720 --> 00:13:07.630
forgotten the name of the company --
Syntex, that he and Carl Djerassi and

00:13:07.630 --> 00:13:08.630
others did.

00:13:08.630 --> 00:13:12.019
And of course, they came up
with a lot of steroid compounds and

00:13:12.019 --> 00:13:14.740
things that were used for birth control
and so on.

00:13:14.740 --> 00:13:18.970
He started a company names
ALZA, which did skin patch technology

00:13:18.970 --> 00:13:22.360
for slow release of things into the
bloodstream.

00:13:22.360 --> 00:13:26.980
And he had started -- he
started this group called Affymax.

00:13:26.980 --> 00:13:34.069
And so, his idea was -- now, remember,
this was late 80s.

00:13:34.069 --> 00:13:38.899
And at the time, you
know, people had now begun to clone

00:13:38.899 --> 00:13:44.540
genes and be able to get receptors and
so on in pure form.

00:13:44.540 --> 00:13:47.190
And so, his idea of
Affymax -- and that's where the name

00:13:47.190 --> 00:13:52.010
Affymax comes from is from this concept
of the affinity matrix.

00:13:52.010 --> 00:13:56.180
And the idea
was that if you had all of the

00:13:56.180 --> 00:14:02.490
receptors, for example, in pure form and
you could clone these and isolate them

00:14:02.490 --> 00:14:08.230
in pure form, he'd like to see ways were
you could assay that, those pure

00:14:08.230 --> 00:14:12.029
receptors against a whole bunch of
chemistry.

00:14:12.029 --> 00:14:15.190
So, where there's natural
products, synthetic, chemistry,

00:14:15.190 --> 00:14:16.610
collections, whatever.

00:14:16.610 --> 00:14:19.320
And so, he
called this the affinity matrix because

00:14:19.320 --> 00:14:23.760
you want to measure the affinity of
receptors against chemical diversity.

00:14:23.760 --> 00:14:27.269
And so, we started to play around with a
whole bunch of ideas.

00:14:27.269 --> 00:14:34.389
And as I
mentioned, some of them were things like

00:14:34.389 --> 00:14:38.709
chemical collections, things like
natural products.

00:14:38.709 --> 00:14:42.150
We were introduced to
a whole bunch of really good characters

00:14:42.150 --> 00:14:46.360
at the point, guys like Josh Lederberg
were there thinking about cauldron

00:14:46.360 --> 00:14:49.830
chemistry, what he used to call cauldron
chemistry where you would, you know,

00:14:49.830 --> 00:14:54.040
cook up a tar like from the tar pits and
see what kind of magic compounds were

00:14:54.040 --> 00:14:55.230
hidden in there.

00:14:55.230 --> 00:14:58.600
I mean, just some
really great fascinating stuff,

00:14:58.600 --> 00:15:02.139
remembering that this was actually a
long -- you know, quite a while ago

00:15:02.139 --> 00:15:05.209
before much of this was very popular.

00:15:05.209 --> 00:15:09.029
One of the ideas, a guy named Leit Norid
[spelled phonetically] said, "Well, gee"

00:15:09.029 --> 00:15:13.540
-- he was infatuated by semiconductor
world -- "isn't there some way that we

00:15:13.540 --> 00:15:18.790
could use light to direct chemical
reactions and put this together?"

00:15:18.790 --> 00:15:21.251
And I
thought that was -- Lubert and I both

00:15:21.251 --> 00:15:24.560
thought that was a fascinating idea.

00:15:24.560 --> 00:15:29.160
And so, I started thinking about how to
do that.

00:15:29.160 --> 00:15:32.420
And some of the chemists had
some interesting ideas about

00:15:32.420 --> 00:15:35.410
photochemical protecting groups and so
on, Michael Parongal [spelled

00:15:35.410 --> 00:15:37.660
phonetically] was one of them, Dennis
Solis [spelled phonetically] was

00:15:37.660 --> 00:15:44.399
another, Pete Schultz was coming in at
the time and had some interesting

00:15:44.399 --> 00:15:45.730
contributions.

00:15:45.730 --> 00:15:50.459
And so, you know, I just
started to do some really simple

00:15:50.459 --> 00:15:51.459
experiments.

00:15:51.459 --> 00:15:55.810
And, you know, how could
you do, you know, light-directed

00:15:55.810 --> 00:16:03.980
synthesis in very precise locations at a
microscopic level on a solid surface?

00:16:03.980 --> 00:16:09.379
When I first went to Affymax, I was
somewhat horrified because, you know, it

00:16:09.379 --> 00:16:10.540
was a startup.

00:16:10.540 --> 00:16:14.079
I'd been used to now
being in pretty well-funded labs.

00:16:14.079 --> 00:16:16.810
And I
went in there and I was given a desk and

00:16:16.810 --> 00:16:18.649
empty rooms.

00:16:18.649 --> 00:16:21.940
And I had to call up on
the phone and order, you know, pipets

00:16:21.940 --> 00:16:24.569
and big tips, and chem wads.

00:16:24.569 --> 00:16:26.279
And I
thought, "Oh my god, you know, I'd just

00:16:26.279 --> 00:16:28.040
committed career suicide.

00:16:28.040 --> 00:16:31.220
I've gone to
school for the last, you know, freaking

00:16:31.220 --> 00:16:38.569
25 years or something and now, you know,
what have I done?"

00:16:38.569 --> 00:16:41.019
You know, I started to do some really
simply experiments.

00:16:41.019 --> 00:16:45.180
Built a very, very
simple apparatus in the beginning which

00:16:45.180 --> 00:16:51.910
was basically a light source, couple
mirrors, and took some -- I did some

00:16:51.910 --> 00:16:57.259
things like printed a checker board on a
piece of paper on a laser printer and

00:16:57.259 --> 00:17:01.149
then took a picture of it and then had
the film developed and I would use that

00:17:01.149 --> 00:17:05.110
as a lithographic mask and shine the
light through it and image that down

00:17:05.110 --> 00:17:06.950
onto surfaces.

00:17:06.950 --> 00:17:10.890
And started to do some
very basic experiment derivatizing the

00:17:10.890 --> 00:17:17.580
glass, attaching and working with some
chemists to attach these photochemical

00:17:17.580 --> 00:17:23.140
removal groups onto the covalently
linked surface molecules and

00:17:23.140 --> 00:17:29.701
demonstrating that indeed we could
excite the allieving [spelled

00:17:29.701 --> 00:17:33.450
phonetically] groups in different areas
on the glass and well-defined areas at

00:17:33.450 --> 00:17:35.840
different resolutions.

00:17:35.840 --> 00:17:41.110
And actually, in
a way that was not available to you by

00:17:41.110 --> 00:17:45.890
printing normally, you know, by putting
pipets down or doing something physical.

00:17:45.890 --> 00:17:55.460
We could then generate designs on
surfaces or patterns on surfaces and

00:17:55.460 --> 00:18:00.540
direct chemistry through the use of
light on a surface.

00:18:00.540 --> 00:18:05.400
And so, we started to work on that,
started to build some things on the

00:18:05.400 --> 00:18:06.400
surface.

00:18:06.400 --> 00:18:09.610
Started, as you might expect,
because of working with Lubert and

00:18:09.610 --> 00:18:17.290
because of my background, began to use
fluorescence as a read out.

00:18:17.290 --> 00:18:19.990
And
demonstrated very quickly that we could

00:18:19.990 --> 00:18:22.450
start to synthesize molecules on a
surface.

00:18:22.450 --> 00:18:25.950
And we used some very simple
peptide recognition systems in the

00:18:25.950 --> 00:18:26.950
beginning.

00:18:26.950 --> 00:18:30.080
We would, you know,
synthesize a little peptide that we can

00:18:30.080 --> 00:18:31.400
an antibody that could recognize.

00:18:31.400 --> 00:18:33.940
We
could fluorescently tag the antibody and

00:18:33.940 --> 00:18:39.300
you could show now you could spatially
resolve a synthesis compounds.

00:18:39.300 --> 00:18:46.700
So, I ended up, you know, building then
-- we had to have a reader.

00:18:46.700 --> 00:18:50.130
And so, I
ended up building a laser through a

00:18:50.130 --> 00:18:54.100
microscope down to a surface with xy
stages.

00:18:54.100 --> 00:18:58.210
Then started to do raster
scanning and so on so you could build up

00:18:58.210 --> 00:19:02.690
a two-dimensional image of the
fluorescence map, if you will, of a

00:19:02.690 --> 00:19:03.690
surface.

00:19:03.690 --> 00:19:07.860
And by the way, none of these
type of experiment equipment existed

00:19:07.860 --> 00:19:08.860
back then.

00:19:08.860 --> 00:19:11.750
You know, there were some
epi-fluorescent microscopes that you

00:19:11.750 --> 00:19:14.020
could look at very, very small fields of
view.

00:19:14.020 --> 00:19:16.790
But nothing where if you wanted
to scan, you know, a couple centimeters

00:19:16.790 --> 00:19:19.170
by a couple centimeters you could do.

00:19:19.170 --> 00:19:21.340
And so, I built these systems.

00:19:21.340 --> 00:19:26.290
And then
continued to work on making, you know,

00:19:26.290 --> 00:19:29.290
compounds in different places.

00:19:29.290 --> 00:19:31.920
We then
kind of stumbled upon -- well, say you

00:19:31.920 --> 00:19:35.800
wanted to build a matrix of many, many
different types of compounds -- because

00:19:35.800 --> 00:19:39.330
that was the original ambition -- you
know, how could you build millions of

00:19:39.330 --> 00:19:41.520
compounds on the surface?

00:19:41.520 --> 00:19:46.340
And it became
very apparent that well, you can't

00:19:46.340 --> 00:19:50.400
really do it by using millions of steps.

00:19:50.400 --> 00:19:53.770
And so then the question, "Well how do
you actually build large sets of

00:19:53.770 --> 00:19:55.160
molecules?"

00:19:55.160 --> 00:19:59.930
And so, we came up with
some primitive ideas on how to build

00:19:59.930 --> 00:20:01.650
some overlapping sets.

00:20:01.650 --> 00:20:05.470
And Lubert
actually had some great ideas on how to

00:20:05.470 --> 00:20:11.160
build a sort of a, you know, a constant
set of oligonucleotides or peptides.

00:20:11.160 --> 00:20:17.830
But it was actually the first experiment
that we were doing where, you know, we

00:20:17.830 --> 00:20:22.670
now, you know, by hand drew out some
lithographic masks.

00:20:22.670 --> 00:20:24.440
Fabian Pease is another guy, by the way.

00:20:24.440 --> 00:20:26.270
I should bring this in.

00:20:26.270 --> 00:20:28.240
When we
started to put together a lithographic

00:20:28.240 --> 00:20:34.240
system in order to make the first, what
are now called microarrays.

00:20:34.240 --> 00:20:37.700
We went
down to some old junk shops in Silicon

00:20:37.700 --> 00:20:42.170
Valley and bought some used aligners
that were used to make printed circuit

00:20:42.170 --> 00:20:46.910
boards and so on and brought this up to
our little office building in Palo Alto.

00:20:46.910 --> 00:20:51.490
We had to chop out some weeds and so on
to get this into a room.

00:20:51.490 --> 00:20:57.280
But we had set
it up now with an old lithographic

00:20:57.280 --> 00:21:01.940
aligner that was used in the
semiconductor industry.

00:21:01.940 --> 00:21:07.050
I had hand
drawn lithographic mask designs that

00:21:07.050 --> 00:21:15.730
could be used to do some pattern work to
synthesize our sort of first arrays.

00:21:15.730 --> 00:21:21.330
And we had bought, at that point, an ABI
synthesizer that synthesized, you know,

00:21:21.330 --> 00:21:26.300
one oligonucleotide at a time and taken
it apart, but used that as a chemical

00:21:26.300 --> 00:21:31.770
reagent dispenser and plumed it over to
the lithographic instrument with a

00:21:31.770 --> 00:21:33.420
holder in microfluidics and so on.

00:21:33.420 --> 00:21:35.620
And
so, we had all these pieces put

00:21:35.620 --> 00:21:36.800
together.

00:21:36.800 --> 00:21:38.920
And then of course, as I
mentioned, we also had the first

00:21:38.920 --> 00:21:43.630
scanners that were in the other room
ready to scan this thing.

00:21:43.630 --> 00:21:47.240
And so, as we started to do the first
photolysis, you know, we were going to

00:21:47.240 --> 00:21:55.490
lay down a particular building block of
an amino acid.

00:21:55.490 --> 00:22:00.730
And then as I turned the
micrometer to go to the next region

00:22:00.730 --> 00:22:05.570
where I was going to do the photolysis,
I realized that, "Well, if I overlapped

00:22:05.570 --> 00:22:12.250
it on the very next step, not only would
I put compound A down and compound B,

00:22:12.250 --> 00:22:13.650
but I would also build AB."

00:22:13.650 --> 00:22:15.960
And so, I
went into Lubert.

00:22:15.960 --> 00:22:17.560
I said, "Wait a
minute, you know.

00:22:17.560 --> 00:22:19.070
There's something we
don't understand.

00:22:19.070 --> 00:22:23.550
There's this whole
field of how do we do these overlaps in

00:22:23.550 --> 00:22:27.120
order to generate lots of chemical
compounds."

00:22:27.120 --> 00:22:31.070
And so, it turns out this
got us on a whole path of really

00:22:31.070 --> 00:22:36.560
thinking about, you know, how many
compounds can you make in how many

00:22:36.560 --> 00:22:38.090
chemical steps.

00:22:38.090 --> 00:22:40.530
And so, we had some
great discussions about it, and it

00:22:40.530 --> 00:22:46.300
dawned on us that this was really a very
simple binary process.

00:22:46.300 --> 00:22:49.180
And we had
stumbled on to, you know, a

00:22:49.180 --> 00:22:52.730
formalization of the world of
combinatorics, combinatorial chemistry.

00:22:52.730 --> 00:22:58.170
And so, we formalized this and it turns
out that you could make two to the n

00:22:58.170 --> 00:23:02.711
compounds in n chemical steps, which
means, you know, if you want to make a

00:23:02.711 --> 00:23:06.410
million compounds, no it doesn't take
you a million chemical steps.

00:23:06.410 --> 00:23:09.780
In fact,
you know, two to the tenth is about a

00:23:09.780 --> 00:23:10.780
thousand.

00:23:10.780 --> 00:23:13.510
Two to the twentieth is about
a million.

00:23:13.510 --> 00:23:16.480
So, it actually turns out
that in about twenty chemical steps, you

00:23:16.480 --> 00:23:19.600
can actually make a diversity of about a
million.

00:23:19.600 --> 00:23:21.900
And it just grows
exponentially.

00:23:21.900 --> 00:23:23.460
And we would actually
formalize this.

00:23:23.460 --> 00:23:27.200
We put it into matrix
algebra and figured out how to create

00:23:27.200 --> 00:23:29.540
the lithographic masks from the matrix
algebra.

00:23:29.540 --> 00:23:33.990
So, it was very rewarding and
a very exciting thing.

00:23:33.990 --> 00:23:37.710
There’s a combination of things that
goes on.

00:23:37.710 --> 00:23:44.740
So, one is at that time and
that place, you know, we actually set

00:23:44.740 --> 00:23:48.090
out to invent something, I think.

00:23:48.090 --> 00:23:52.400
Because we said, we want to have
something that can do the following.

00:23:52.400 --> 00:23:58.880
And at that time and at that point, we
had a nice bolus of money that was not

00:23:58.880 --> 00:24:01.420
earmarked specifically for particular
things.

00:24:01.420 --> 00:24:03.730
So, I had a tremendous amount
of freedom.

00:24:03.730 --> 00:24:05.320
You know, I could try this
experiment.

00:24:05.320 --> 00:24:06.940
If it didn't work, I could
try something else.

00:24:06.940 --> 00:24:12.110
If I wanted to,
you know, spend $100,000 to build a nice

00:24:12.110 --> 00:24:15.250
scanning instrument, I didn't have to
ask anybody for permission.

00:24:15.250 --> 00:24:17.030
I didn't
have to write a grant.

00:24:17.030 --> 00:24:20.150
I didn't have to
wait for them to give it to me and to go

00:24:20.150 --> 00:24:22.910
through the whole review process.

00:24:22.910 --> 00:24:25.070
And
we can talk about that later because

00:24:25.070 --> 00:24:27.610
that brings in a whole -- it's not that
that's bad.

00:24:27.610 --> 00:24:32.280
It's just that if you want
to move fast and if you've got an idea,

00:24:32.280 --> 00:24:35.190
you want to be funded in a way that is
very, very flexible.

00:24:35.190 --> 00:24:36.190
And I think that's
it.

00:24:36.190 --> 00:24:39.920
And I think a lot of it is the
funding.

00:24:39.920 --> 00:24:44.000
A lot of it is just the
culture that you set up.

00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:48.440
You know, this
was going to be a company.

00:24:48.440 --> 00:24:51.320
But its
first main purpose was to invent some

00:24:51.320 --> 00:24:57.030
new ways to look at biology and new ways
to screen chemical diversity.

00:24:57.030 --> 00:25:00.670
And so,
our purpose at that point was to not

00:25:00.670 --> 00:25:01.670
make money.

00:25:01.670 --> 00:25:05.600
Our purpose at that point
was to open a new field and to develop

00:25:05.600 --> 00:25:06.930
new technology.

00:25:06.930 --> 00:25:11.760
And I think that's --
it's academics at the time, that would

00:25:11.760 --> 00:25:13.160
have been hard.

00:25:13.160 --> 00:25:17.530
Because I think you
could -- and even today, it's probably

00:25:17.530 --> 00:25:18.530
kind of tough.

00:25:18.530 --> 00:25:21.640
There are some places
that give you great startup funding and

00:25:21.640 --> 00:25:25.590
you maybe have a little window to do
that.

00:25:25.590 --> 00:25:30.210
But, you know, it kind of falls
into two buckets these days.

00:25:30.210 --> 00:25:32.660
One is you
have a tremendous amount of freedom and

00:25:32.660 --> 00:25:34.010
not much money.

00:25:34.010 --> 00:25:37.580
Or you have a big
project to undertake and so you're

00:25:37.580 --> 00:25:38.750
extremely well-funded.

00:25:38.750 --> 00:25:40.850
And then people
figure out, "Well, how do I leverage

00:25:40.850 --> 00:25:44.190
that into having a little bit of
freedom?"

00:25:44.190 --> 00:25:48.610
But this was a lot easier
back then in many ways because this was

00:25:48.610 --> 00:25:53.440
a brand-new area that nobody really had
any results in.

00:25:53.440 --> 00:25:58.400
So, you know, as we started to work on
this -- one thing I should have said is

00:25:58.400 --> 00:26:02.140
that it should be obvious right now that
we took an approach which was a

00:26:02.140 --> 00:26:05.380
combinatorial approach, which was a
building block approach.

00:26:05.380 --> 00:26:08.630
And of course,
we took our inspiration from nature.

00:26:08.630 --> 00:26:12.891
Nature creates chemical diversity
through the combinatorial assembly of a

00:26:12.891 --> 00:26:15.000
limited set of building blocks.

00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:16.770
It does
this in the nucleic acids.

00:26:16.770 --> 00:26:17.770
It does it
in sugars.

00:26:17.770 --> 00:26:23.150
It does it in peptides,
amino acids to peptides to proteins and

00:26:23.150 --> 00:26:24.410
so on.

00:26:24.410 --> 00:26:29.810
And so, you know, we took this
building block approach.

00:26:29.810 --> 00:26:35.410
And the two
obvious building blocks were peptides

00:26:35.410 --> 00:26:36.910
and nucleic acids.

00:26:36.910 --> 00:26:39.610
Both of those
chemistries had been worked out the

00:26:39.610 --> 00:26:44.420
solid phase chemistry of both of those
important chemistries.

00:26:44.420 --> 00:26:48.160
As I started --
so, for the science paper that came out

00:26:48.160 --> 00:26:53.680
in 1991, a lot of the recognition
because, you know, we had the reagents

00:26:53.680 --> 00:26:55.670
and so on, was done on peptides.

00:26:55.670 --> 00:26:59.280
But in
that paper, we also worked out the

00:26:59.280 --> 00:27:02.290
fundamental chemistry and methods of
doing nucleic acids.

00:27:02.290 --> 00:27:05.500
And it was just --
it was very limited, but we enabled the

00:27:05.500 --> 00:27:08.150
chemistry in that paper.

00:27:08.150 --> 00:27:11.220
And actually,
in the abstract of that paper, as you'll

00:27:11.220 --> 00:27:17.200
read -- and this is what got me very
excited -- was in the early -- in, well

00:27:17.200 --> 00:27:26.390
this was 1990ish now at this point.

00:27:26.390 --> 00:27:29.521
The
Dramanis [spelled phonetically] and

00:27:29.521 --> 00:27:34.400
Zircunyakov [spelled phonetically] as
well as Andrei Mirzabekov had come up

00:27:34.400 --> 00:27:37.870
with this idea of sequencing by
hybridization.

00:27:37.870 --> 00:27:41.800
And the idea was, well
let's say I could make a complete set of

00:27:41.800 --> 00:27:42.800
all the eight-mers.

00:27:42.800 --> 00:27:48.120
So, that's 65,436
or something like that, you know, 64k.

00:27:48.120 --> 00:27:52.940
And if I could make all of those
eight-mers, I should be able to add

00:27:52.940 --> 00:27:57.990
those eight-mers to an unknown strand of
DNA and then depending on which one

00:27:57.990 --> 00:28:01.450
bound, I could tell you what that
sequence was.

00:28:01.450 --> 00:28:04.160
And so, this was also in
the context at the time that everyone

00:28:04.160 --> 00:28:06.140
was talking about doing the human
genome.

00:28:06.140 --> 00:28:09.830
And wouldn't it be great if,
you know, we had new sequencing methods

00:28:09.830 --> 00:28:10.830
and so on.

00:28:10.830 --> 00:28:13.320
And of course, there was
Sanger sequencing, which was great and

00:28:13.320 --> 00:28:17.790
extremely accurate and still a gold
standard today.

00:28:17.790 --> 00:28:22.040
But this was an idea of
doing something new and very innovative.

00:28:22.040 --> 00:28:27.050
And so, you know, as we started to
develop out our chemistry and realize

00:28:27.050 --> 00:28:32.590
that we could make these matrices of
high-density chemical compounds, it

00:28:32.590 --> 00:28:35.470
became very obvious that one of the
things we really wanted to do was

00:28:35.470 --> 00:28:36.490
nucleic acids.

00:28:36.490 --> 00:28:38.850
They also had a certain
advantage because there's only four

00:28:38.850 --> 00:28:40.210
building blocks.

00:28:40.210 --> 00:28:43.180
Whereas proteins have
20, okay?

00:28:43.180 --> 00:28:47.120
And so, your number of
reagents for proteins goes way up and

00:28:47.120 --> 00:28:53.540
the medicinal chemists, of course, came
up with all kinds of new building blocks

00:28:53.540 --> 00:28:56.150
all the time they wanted to add into
your repertoire.

00:28:56.150 --> 00:29:01.620
So, I started to get to this position
where Affymax wanted to be a drug

00:29:01.620 --> 00:29:03.020
discovery company.

00:29:03.020 --> 00:29:04.020
They wanted to go
on.

00:29:04.020 --> 00:29:08.460
They wanted to explore peptides,
natural compounds, natural products, and

00:29:08.460 --> 00:29:11.030
eventually be a pharmaceutical company.

00:29:11.030 --> 00:29:15.070
But, when I started to develop this
technology, to me, it was exceedingly

00:29:15.070 --> 00:29:21.840
obvious the right home for this was in
nucleic acids because there were only

00:29:21.840 --> 00:29:22.840
four building blocks.

00:29:22.840 --> 00:29:25.400
And then when you
looked at something like this SBH

00:29:25.400 --> 00:29:30.020
technology, sequencing by hybridization,
they only wanted to make 65,000 of them.

00:29:30.020 --> 00:29:31.420
Well, that was a piece of cake.

00:29:31.420 --> 00:29:32.990
So, I
knew that was going to be a piece of

00:29:32.990 --> 00:29:33.990
cake.

00:29:33.990 --> 00:29:37.690
And so, you know, this was all
theoretical, you've got to remember.

00:29:37.690 --> 00:29:39.790
It
was a theoretical construct that we

00:29:39.790 --> 00:29:42.600
should be able to do SBH.

00:29:42.600 --> 00:29:44.840
And here, I'd
been developing this technology and I

00:29:44.840 --> 00:29:48.060
read these papers and I said, "Well,
hell, we can do that.

00:29:48.060 --> 00:29:50.480
That's a piece of
cake."

00:29:50.480 --> 00:29:52.710
And so, I started working on it.

00:29:52.710 --> 00:29:58.280
Now, that didn't go over so well with
everybody at Affymax.

00:29:58.280 --> 00:30:00.740
You know, me, I
was still -- you know, I still

00:30:00.740 --> 00:30:03.110
appreciated the problems they had.

00:30:03.110 --> 00:30:05.870
You
know, but let me tell you that, you

00:30:05.870 --> 00:30:13.080
know, I started I think in July of '89
and we had the cover of Science about 18

00:30:13.080 --> 00:30:14.080
months later.

00:30:14.080 --> 00:30:15.410
So, this was very fast
moving.

00:30:15.410 --> 00:30:17.980
I mean, it was -- the
experiments worked.

00:30:17.980 --> 00:30:20.950
It just went click,
click, click, click, click.

00:30:20.950 --> 00:30:23.020
And then I
wanted to turn all my attention to

00:30:23.020 --> 00:30:26.940
nucleic acids because I just thought
that was the future.

00:30:26.940 --> 00:30:29.370
And you know,
everyone remembered there was no human

00:30:29.370 --> 00:30:30.370
genome.

00:30:30.370 --> 00:30:32.330
There was -- people were still
arguing about whether they should do the

00:30:32.330 --> 00:30:36.600
human genome project in 1990.

00:30:36.600 --> 00:30:43.890
And so, through this interaction at
Affymax, I had come to make friends with

00:30:43.890 --> 00:30:49.890
a number of different people including,
Ron Davis at Stanford, and told him

00:30:49.890 --> 00:30:54.700
about what we were doing, and Paul Berg
who was also at Stanford.

00:30:54.700 --> 00:30:59.970
Now, Paul was
I believe on the early council or

00:30:59.970 --> 00:31:06.860
advisors or something to recommend the
human genome project.

00:31:06.860 --> 00:31:12.420
And in 1991,
after the Science paper, he invited me

00:31:12.420 --> 00:31:19.640
to come give a talk in front of -- you
know, there was Jim Watson and some -- I

00:31:19.640 --> 00:31:22.000
think this was in Concord or something.

00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:27.420
But it was a huge panel of people that
wanted to go after, you know -- that

00:31:27.420 --> 00:31:29.180
wanted to sequence the human genome.

00:31:29.180 --> 00:31:33.020
And so, they were very interested in
alternate sequencing technologies.

00:31:33.020 --> 00:31:38.690
And I'll never forget this because Paul
invited me to go speak in front of these

00:31:38.690 --> 00:31:39.720
guys.

00:31:39.720 --> 00:31:43.660
And you have to remember at this
point, you know, I got spoiled very

00:31:43.660 --> 00:31:47.840
quickly at Affymax because they gave me
-- because this program was so

00:31:47.840 --> 00:31:51.130
successful, they basically gave me all
the -- Alex Zaffaroni gave me all the

00:31:51.130 --> 00:31:52.350
money I wanted.

00:31:52.350 --> 00:31:59.440
And although it wasn't
fitting into the ambitions and, you

00:31:59.440 --> 00:32:03.240
know, what everybody wanted to do from a
business perspective at Affymax, the

00:32:03.240 --> 00:32:08.230
science was just so cool that Alex just,
you know, protected me and made sure I

00:32:08.230 --> 00:32:10.660
had the funding I needed to pursue these
things.

00:32:10.660 --> 00:32:18.330
So, when I went in front of the panel
for the human genome project, I showed

00:32:18.330 --> 00:32:25.530
what we have done, and I also showed
them what I thought we could do in terms

00:32:25.530 --> 00:32:28.750
of building arrays of nucleic acids.

00:32:28.750 --> 00:32:32.370
And I remembered Jim Watson at the time
-- and you have to remember, this was --

00:32:32.370 --> 00:32:33.940
it's very `commonplace` now.

00:32:33.940 --> 00:32:35.660
Everybody
knows what an array is.

00:32:35.660 --> 00:32:38.990
Everybody is
used to array formats.

00:32:38.990 --> 00:32:41.360
But back then
nobody was because it was all brand new.

00:32:41.360 --> 00:32:45.960
And so, I had these nice scans and
pictures of these fluorescent maps of

00:32:45.960 --> 00:32:46.960
these compounds.

00:32:46.960 --> 00:32:49.570
And I was showing
this, and Jim Watson was watching this

00:32:49.570 --> 00:32:50.570
and watching this.

00:32:50.570 --> 00:32:52.410
And he finally
stopped me in the middle of my talk, and

00:32:52.410 --> 00:32:53.410
he says, "Wait a minute.

00:32:53.410 --> 00:32:54.410
Wait a minute.

00:32:54.410 --> 00:32:56.810
Is this real data or are these just
pretty pictures?"

00:32:56.810 --> 00:33:00.060
And you know, I was
very indignant at the time.

00:33:00.060 --> 00:33:01.570
I said,
"Just pay attention."

00:33:01.570 --> 00:33:05.630
You know, and so,
you know, he -- if you know Jim, you

00:33:05.630 --> 00:33:08.770
know he was very crotchety about the
whole thing.

00:33:08.770 --> 00:33:12.340
But here were all these guys that were
very serious.

00:33:12.340 --> 00:33:16.990
So, I was somewhat -- I
was completely a newbie at this and very

00:33:16.990 --> 00:33:21.250
naïve but coming at it from the
technology side and from the sort of

00:33:21.250 --> 00:33:26.961
science of technology side and knew just
very clearly I had a very, very clear

00:33:26.961 --> 00:33:29.490
vision that we could accomplish this.

00:33:29.490 --> 00:33:34.120
And so, you know, we talked about it
there.

00:33:34.120 --> 00:33:40.160
I was just barraged with
questions from the group and people

00:33:40.160 --> 00:33:42.780
wanting to know, you know, "How are you
going to solve repetitive elements?"

00:33:42.780 --> 00:33:46.120
"How are you going to solve the branch
structures?" all this sort of stuff.

00:33:46.120 --> 00:33:50.580
I actually remember Jasper Ryan was
there and he asked some very pointed

00:33:50.580 --> 00:33:54.180
questions, but not from an evil
perspective, you know, from a very

00:33:54.180 --> 00:33:58.320
constructive perspective, but a very
hard question.

00:33:58.320 --> 00:34:00.720
And I basically said, "I
don't know."

00:34:00.720 --> 00:34:01.850
I said, "I do not know."

00:34:01.850 --> 00:34:06.510
All I know is that we will make these
things and we will test these ideas.

00:34:06.510 --> 00:34:08.460
And that was my attitude.

00:34:08.460 --> 00:34:14.050
Uou know there was, complicated politics
around the whole genome project and all

00:34:14.050 --> 00:34:15.050
the people involved.

00:34:15.050 --> 00:34:17.600
And everybody had
their own idea about the directions they

00:34:17.600 --> 00:34:18.600
should go.

00:34:18.600 --> 00:34:22.470
But, you know, I was looking
at it from a little bit different

00:34:22.470 --> 00:34:23.470
perspective.

00:34:23.470 --> 00:34:26.859
Because by then, you know,
I'd really realized, you know, for

00:34:26.859 --> 00:34:32.980
example, you know, we knew that we
wanted to make things on the order of 30

00:34:32.980 --> 00:34:38.679
bases long because they gave very nice
stability and you could actually do

00:34:38.679 --> 00:34:44.010
single base pair mismatches with
something of that size.

00:34:44.010 --> 00:34:48.829
And so, it was
-- but 30 long, you know, that's a

00:34:48.829 --> 00:34:50.419
number like 40 to the thirtieth.

00:34:50.419 --> 00:34:53.579
I
mean, that is a really, really, really,

00:34:53.579 --> 00:34:55.190
big number, okay.

00:34:55.190 --> 00:34:58.440
And you know, two to
the sixtieth.

00:34:58.440 --> 00:35:01.480
I'm not even sure how
large that number is, but it's

00:35:01.480 --> 00:35:03.040
ridiculously large.

00:35:03.040 --> 00:35:08.450
But the thing is that combinatorally,
you could make all of 30-mers in four

00:35:08.450 --> 00:35:13.470
times 30 steps or 120 steps, which means
you could make any subset of them.

00:35:13.470 --> 00:35:14.869
And
so, I started to think about this more

00:35:14.869 --> 00:35:19.980
as an information technology that what
would really happen is that the genome

00:35:19.980 --> 00:35:24.830
would be sequenced and then we could
copy basically the genome down onto

00:35:24.830 --> 00:35:25.830
these chips.

00:35:25.830 --> 00:35:28.500
And then you'd have a
format to look at many genomes.

00:35:28.500 --> 00:35:30.670
And
that was the direction that I was going.

00:35:30.670 --> 00:35:31.839
Well, there were two.

00:35:31.839 --> 00:35:34.000
There was one,
you could make these complete sets of

00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:38.650
eight-mers, 10-mers and so on and say,
could I do sequencing by hybridization.

00:35:38.650 --> 00:35:43.789
And then you could also make arrays that
were designed as basic memory devices

00:35:43.789 --> 00:35:46.070
against certain pieces of DNA.

00:35:46.070 --> 00:35:46.250
