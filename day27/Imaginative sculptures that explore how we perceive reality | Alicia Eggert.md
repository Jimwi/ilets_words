00:00:13.507 --> 00:00:16.286
If you happened to be
in the town of Lubec, Maine

00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:18.595
in July of 2016,

00:00:18.619 --> 00:00:21.567
you may have seen something
a little curious on the horizon

00:00:21.591 --> 00:00:23.669
when you looked out across the bay.

00:00:24.363 --> 00:00:25.625
In the distance,

00:00:25.649 --> 00:00:28.235
on an otherwise uninhabited island,

00:00:28.259 --> 00:00:31.957
loomed large black letters
that spelled the word "FOREVER."

00:00:31.981 --> 00:00:35.957
The sign was 15 feet tall
and 50 feet wide,

00:00:35.981 --> 00:00:40.307
large enough so that on a clear day,
you really could see "FOREVER,"

00:00:40.331 --> 00:00:44.037
the word perfectly visible
and legible in the distance.

00:00:44.061 --> 00:00:45.402
But on some days,

00:00:45.426 --> 00:00:49.148
a thick white fog
would roll in off the ocean,

00:00:49.172 --> 00:00:52.267
erasing the word and the view altogether.

00:00:53.291 --> 00:00:55.815
And sometimes, like in this video,

00:00:55.839 --> 00:01:00.211
you could barely see "FOREVER"
peeking out of the shifting fog,

00:01:00.235 --> 00:01:04.589
accompanied only by the rhythmic
warning sounds of fog horns.

00:01:04.613 --> 00:01:07.069
(Sound of fog horn)

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:13.093
(Sound of fog horn)

00:01:13.792 --> 00:01:16.283
It started out as a fairly simple idea,

00:01:16.307 --> 00:01:17.998
albeit a little strange,

00:01:18.022 --> 00:01:20.235
to put the word "FOREVER" in the landscape

00:01:20.259 --> 00:01:22.958
so it could appear
and disappear in the fog.

00:01:23.601 --> 00:01:26.674
But it took over a year
to plan and execute,

00:01:26.698 --> 00:01:29.428
and it required the help
of so many people,

00:01:29.452 --> 00:01:31.571
like the lobster boat captain,

00:01:31.595 --> 00:01:34.809
who helped transport
all of the materials to the island.

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:39.438
And the volunteers, who helped carry
thousands of pounds of wood and steel

00:01:39.462 --> 00:01:42.566
to the top of the hill
through waist-high shrubs.

00:01:43.791 --> 00:01:45.205
And in the end,

00:01:45.229 --> 00:01:47.918
"FOREVER" only lasted for three weeks.

00:01:47.942 --> 00:01:50.760
(Laughter)

00:01:50.784 --> 00:01:53.602
So if you're wondering
why I did it at all,

00:01:53.626 --> 00:01:56.887
as I often did during that process,

00:01:56.911 --> 00:01:59.537
it might help for you to know
a little bit more about me

00:01:59.561 --> 00:02:01.156
and my upbringing.

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:05.672
I grew up in an evangelical
Christian family.

00:02:05.696 --> 00:02:08.133
And although I'm an atheist today,

00:02:08.157 --> 00:02:10.686
I've realized that my religious upbringing

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:15.299
has played a really important role
in shaping the person that I've become.

00:02:16.109 --> 00:02:19.619
In 1986, when I was five years old,

00:02:19.643 --> 00:02:22.843
my parents became missionaries
to South Africa.

00:02:23.237 --> 00:02:26.404
And that was during
the last few years of the apartheid,

00:02:26.428 --> 00:02:29.403
so we lived in an all-white neighborhood,

00:02:29.427 --> 00:02:32.561
and I attended an all-white public school,

00:02:32.585 --> 00:02:35.172
while my parents helped found
a multiracial church

00:02:35.196 --> 00:02:37.053
in downtown Cape Town.

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:39.521
Because I was so young,

00:02:39.545 --> 00:02:41.822
it was impossible for me to understand

00:02:41.846 --> 00:02:45.847
the magnitude of what was happening
in South Africa at that time.

00:02:47.887 --> 00:02:52.786
I witnessed the racism and oppression
of people of color I knew and loved

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:54.339
on a daily basis,

00:02:54.363 --> 00:02:56.712
but because of my own skin color,

00:02:56.736 --> 00:02:59.680
there was no way
I could fully comprehend it.

00:03:00.276 --> 00:03:04.151
But I had the privilege
to experience, firsthand,

00:03:04.175 --> 00:03:08.515
one of the most influential
social movements of the 20th century.

00:03:08.921 --> 00:03:12.942
And the thing that left
a long-lasting impression on me

00:03:12.966 --> 00:03:15.664
was how the people I met in South Africa

00:03:15.688 --> 00:03:19.807
could envision a better future
for themselves and their country.

00:03:20.228 --> 00:03:23.386
A future they really
believed was possible.

00:03:23.974 --> 00:03:27.831
And then they worked together,
relentlessly, for decades,

00:03:27.855 --> 00:03:31.878
until they achieved
that extraordinary historic change.

00:03:32.958 --> 00:03:36.222
I was there to see Nelson Mandela
released from prison,

00:03:36.246 --> 00:03:41.484
and I watched an entire country
begin a major transformation.

00:03:41.913 --> 00:03:44.313
And that transformed me as a person.

00:03:44.974 --> 00:03:49.831
It instilled in me a sense
of wonder and optimism

00:03:49.855 --> 00:03:53.507
and possibility that permeates
everything I create.

00:03:55.178 --> 00:03:56.803
I make sculptures like "FOREVER"

00:03:56.827 --> 00:04:02.522
as a way of giving physical,
tangible forms to language and time.

00:04:02.908 --> 00:04:05.793
Those powerful but invisible forces

00:04:05.817 --> 00:04:10.206
that shape the way we perceive
and experience our realities.

00:04:10.802 --> 00:04:14.910
And in doing so, I try to give
other people the opportunity

00:04:14.934 --> 00:04:18.442
to reflect on their own
perception of reality

00:04:18.466 --> 00:04:21.566
and inspire them to wonder and imagine

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:23.805
what else might be possible.

00:04:25.371 --> 00:04:27.244
I often use signs to do this,

00:04:27.268 --> 00:04:32.146
because of how simply and effectively
they're able to grab our attention

00:04:32.170 --> 00:04:34.450
and communicate information.

00:04:34.965 --> 00:04:38.179
They often point out things
we would otherwise overlook,

00:04:38.203 --> 00:04:42.865
like this sign on the side
of the highway in Texas.

00:04:42.889 --> 00:04:44.039
[TEMPTATIONS]

00:04:44.063 --> 00:04:46.689
They can often signify things
that we can't see at all,

00:04:46.713 --> 00:04:48.752
like the distance to our destination.

00:04:48.776 --> 00:04:52.014
Signs often help to orient us in the world

00:04:52.038 --> 00:04:53.189
[You are on an island]

00:04:53.213 --> 00:04:54.752
by telling us where we are now

00:04:54.776 --> 00:04:56.990
and what's happening
in the present moment,

00:04:57.014 --> 00:04:59.680
but they can also help us zoom out,

00:04:59.704 --> 00:05:01.720
shift our perspective

00:05:01.744 --> 00:05:04.411
and get a glimpse of the bigger picture.

00:05:05.014 --> 00:05:07.736
Imagine, for example,

00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:10.691
you're walking down
the street in Philadelphia.

00:05:11.081 --> 00:05:14.731
A city in the US that contains
so much history,

00:05:14.755 --> 00:05:17.401
the birthplace of our constitution.

00:05:18.565 --> 00:05:20.585
But imagine you're walking down the street

00:05:20.609 --> 00:05:23.776
in an area that's undergoing
a huge transformation

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:25.410
due to gentrification.

00:05:26.069 --> 00:05:28.133
And as you walk down that street,

00:05:28.157 --> 00:05:30.783
you notice something
flashing up above you.

00:05:30.807 --> 00:05:33.926
So you look up and you see this.

00:05:34.371 --> 00:05:36.469
A flashing neon sign that says

00:05:36.493 --> 00:05:39.410
"All the light you see is from the past,"

00:05:39.434 --> 00:05:42.029
and then "All you see is past,"

00:05:42.053 --> 00:05:45.057
before turning off completely
for a brief moment.

00:05:46.723 --> 00:05:48.589
It asks you to stop and notice

00:05:48.613 --> 00:05:51.573
the history embedded
in everything that you see.

00:05:53.486 --> 00:05:54.660
And it reminds you

00:05:54.684 --> 00:05:58.854
that because light takes time
to travel across space,

00:05:58.878 --> 00:06:02.537
even from just across the street
or across the room,

00:06:02.561 --> 00:06:05.136
everything you're seeing
in the present moment

00:06:05.160 --> 00:06:07.958
is technically an image of the past.

00:06:10.565 --> 00:06:13.970
Signs influence the way
we all navigate the world,

00:06:13.994 --> 00:06:16.861
which means they have
the ability to create

00:06:16.885 --> 00:06:19.982
a collective experience or understanding.

00:06:20.807 --> 00:06:23.022
My time in South Africa taught me

00:06:23.046 --> 00:06:26.459
that when people are able
to find common ground

00:06:26.483 --> 00:06:29.823
and work together towards a mutual goal,

00:06:29.847 --> 00:06:33.665
powerful things can happen
and so much more becomes possible.

00:06:34.340 --> 00:06:36.808
And I want to create more opportunities

00:06:36.832 --> 00:06:39.863
for people to find
that kind of common ground.

00:06:40.237 --> 00:06:44.101
I want people to feel
the power of collaboration,

00:06:44.125 --> 00:06:46.006
sometimes quite literally.

00:06:47.252 --> 00:06:48.547
A few years ago,

00:06:48.571 --> 00:06:49.969
a friend of mine showed me

00:06:49.993 --> 00:06:54.616
how our bodies can safely conduct
small amounts of electricity.

00:06:54.982 --> 00:06:57.680
And if you hold hands with another person,

00:06:57.704 --> 00:07:01.355
a small electrical current
can pass through your held hands

00:07:01.379 --> 00:07:05.338
and become like a switch
that can trigger something else to happen.

00:07:06.275 --> 00:07:10.981
So last year, I used
that form of human connection

00:07:11.005 --> 00:07:13.640
to activate an inflatable sculpture.

00:07:14.300 --> 00:07:17.492
I put two sensors on a platform
far enough apart

00:07:17.516 --> 00:07:20.529
so that one person
can't make it work on their own.

00:07:20.903 --> 00:07:23.174
But when two or more people work together

00:07:23.198 --> 00:07:25.760
to complete that electrical circuit,

00:07:25.784 --> 00:07:27.717
the inflatable comes to life.

00:07:28.522 --> 00:07:31.252
And it begins to fill with air,

00:07:31.276 --> 00:07:34.847
and the longer people hold hands,
the larger it becomes,

00:07:34.871 --> 00:07:38.204
expanding into the words "You are magic."

00:07:38.228 --> 00:07:42.387
(Music, birds chirping)

00:07:42.411 --> 00:07:43.744
I always love to see

00:07:43.768 --> 00:07:47.402
how each group of people
finds a different way

00:07:47.426 --> 00:07:50.870
to bridge that physical
and metaphorical divide.

00:07:52.331 --> 00:07:57.045
But as soon as they release their hands
and break that connection,

00:07:57.069 --> 00:08:01.123
the words immediately begin
to `slouch` and fall over

00:08:01.147 --> 00:08:05.369
and eventually return to a lifeless
pile of fabric on the ground.

00:08:06.733 --> 00:08:13.517
(Applause)

00:08:15.422 --> 00:08:19.649
At this moment in time,
I think we could all agree

00:08:19.673 --> 00:08:24.177
that the future feels
pretty `bleak` and uncertain.

00:08:25.709 --> 00:08:27.328
But maybe the hope

00:08:27.352 --> 00:08:32.593
for a brighter, more sustainable,
more `equitable` future

00:08:32.617 --> 00:08:36.156
depends first on our ability
to imagine it.

00:08:38.101 --> 00:08:39.910
But after we imagine it,

00:08:39.934 --> 00:08:42.712
we actually have to believe it's possible.

00:08:44.006 --> 00:08:47.418
And then we have to find common ground

00:08:47.442 --> 00:08:51.347
with people we would maybe
otherwise disagree with

00:08:51.371 --> 00:08:54.304
and work together
towards that mutual goal.

00:08:55.315 --> 00:08:59.101
And if we do that, I believe
we have the capacity for magic.

00:09:00.641 --> 00:09:04.077
So if you can humor me
for one more minute,

00:09:04.101 --> 00:09:09.251
I'm going to ask everyone
in this theater to hold hands.

00:09:14.602 --> 00:09:17.325
When was the last time
you held hands with a stranger?

00:09:17.349 --> 00:09:19.276
(Laughter)

00:09:21.078 --> 00:09:22.522
And if you feel comfortable,

00:09:22.546 --> 00:09:26.308
go ahead and make
that metaphorical gesture

00:09:26.332 --> 00:09:27.934
of reaching across the aisle.

00:09:28.315 --> 00:09:31.974
And after you've held hands
with people on either side of you,

00:09:31.998 --> 00:09:34.855
if you feel comfortable,
please close your eyes.

00:09:35.522 --> 00:09:39.265
Now take a minute to imagine
what you want,

00:09:39.289 --> 00:09:42.355
what you want the future to look like.

00:09:42.797 --> 00:09:47.876
And give yourself permission
to be at least a little bit idealistic.

00:09:50.075 --> 00:09:55.439
What do you want to see change or happen
in your own life as an individual?

00:09:56.868 --> 00:10:02.759
What do you want to see change or happen
for everyone, for the planet?

00:10:04.300 --> 00:10:05.894
Can you picture it?

00:10:06.641 --> 00:10:11.068
And can you start to see how,
if we all worked together,

00:10:11.092 --> 00:10:13.584
it might actually be possible?

00:10:15.512 --> 00:10:17.272
Now open your eyes,

00:10:18.275 --> 00:10:20.050
and let's make it real.

00:10:20.998 --> 00:10:22.173
Thank you.

00:10:22.197 --> 00:10:27.967
(Applause)
