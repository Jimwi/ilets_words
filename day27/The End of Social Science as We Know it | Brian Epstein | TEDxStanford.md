00:00:11.463 --> 00:00:15.503
Let me take you back
to the autumn of 2008,

00:00:15.503 --> 00:00:18.935
when the global financial system
almost collapsed.

00:00:18.935 --> 00:00:22.715
Back in March, Bear Stearns
had gone bankrupt,

00:00:22.715 --> 00:00:26.624
but people weren't really sure then
whether that was a one-off event,

00:00:26.624 --> 00:00:29.276
or whether it was foretelling
something worse.

00:00:29.276 --> 00:00:34.002
Then in July, IndyMac,
a huge mortgage bank, went under,

00:00:34.002 --> 00:00:35.974
and markets started to get nervous.

00:00:35.974 --> 00:00:38.975
By the middle of September,
they were in full panic.

00:00:39.285 --> 00:00:42.224
On September 15th,
Lehman Brothers collapsed.

00:00:42.224 --> 00:00:43.543
The very next day,

00:00:43.543 --> 00:00:47.081
AIG had to be bailed out
for 85 billion dollars.

00:00:47.381 --> 00:00:52.152
Then on September 29th,
the Dow fell 778 points.

00:00:52.422 --> 00:00:58.774
And so began a multiyear global depression
that we're only now getting out of.

00:00:59.604 --> 00:01:03.504
It sure is a good thing we have
15,000 economists in the United States.

00:01:03.504 --> 00:01:04.384
(Laughter)

00:01:04.384 --> 00:01:07.566
You might have thought they could have
let us know this was coming.

00:01:07.566 --> 00:01:10.086
You might have thought they could have

00:01:10.086 --> 00:01:12.276
given us some policies
for when it did arrive.

00:01:12.276 --> 00:01:13.557
But they didn't.

00:01:13.557 --> 00:01:17.436
Before the crisis, the greatest economists
in the world didn't see it.

00:01:17.436 --> 00:01:21.276
When the crisis came,
they bickered about what to do.

00:01:21.526 --> 00:01:25.666
Today, years later, they're still debating
the fundamental causes.

00:01:25.666 --> 00:01:31.149
No wonder we don't have good policies
in place for avoiding the next crisis.

00:01:31.149 --> 00:01:34.719
This represents a great failure
of social science.

00:01:35.419 --> 00:01:38.199
The social sciences are not working.

00:01:39.349 --> 00:01:43.416
Sociology, economics,
political science, history;

00:01:43.416 --> 00:01:46.490
we need good answers
from these disciplines.

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:49.178
Imagine what we could accomplish

00:01:49.178 --> 00:01:51.798
if we were actually good
at social science.

00:01:51.798 --> 00:01:55.110
Imagine the crises we could avoid.

00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:57.439
Imagine the lives we could save.

00:01:57.439 --> 00:02:00.000
Today I want to talk to you
about some new ideas

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.800
for fixing the foundations
of social science,

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:05.460
for rebuilding them from the ground up.

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:08.170
At the heart of this talk
is one simple point:

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:10.089
There's a certain kind of question

00:02:10.089 --> 00:02:12.760
that we're not really asking
in the social sciences,

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:14.910
something that we're largely overlooking.

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:18.010
It's what I'll call
a "What is it?" question.

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:23.111
These are questions we rarely ask,
and when we do bother to ask them,

00:02:23.111 --> 00:02:25.320
we tend to get the answers wrong.

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:29.608
The reason is the social sciences
are largely in the Dark Ages,

00:02:29.608 --> 00:02:33.942
they're relying on old assumptions
and dogmas that we need to overturn.

00:02:33.942 --> 00:02:38.143
So let me start by distinguishing
two kinds of questions in the sciences:

00:02:38.143 --> 00:02:41.533
"What is it?" questions
and "How does it work?" questions.

00:02:41.533 --> 00:02:44.774
These questions are fairly familiar
in the physical sciences

00:02:44.774 --> 00:02:48.695
or natural sciences, like physics
and chemistry and biology.

00:02:49.395 --> 00:02:53.265
"What is it?" questions are questions
about structure or composition.

00:02:53.265 --> 00:02:56.027
Like, suppose you have a molecule of DNA.

00:02:56.027 --> 00:02:59.604
What is the structure of it?
What are it's building blocks? What is it?

00:02:59.604 --> 00:03:01.011
"How does it work?" questions

00:03:01.011 --> 00:03:04.184
are questions about
mechanisms or processes.

00:03:04.184 --> 00:03:06.786
Like, imagine that you have
a strand of DNA

00:03:06.786 --> 00:03:09.906
and some enzymes out of which
a protein is being built.

00:03:09.906 --> 00:03:12.326
What's the process
by which that's happening?

00:03:12.326 --> 00:03:15.704
What's the sequence of causes and effects?

00:03:15.874 --> 00:03:19.306
Scientists spend some of their time
answering the first kind of question

00:03:19.306 --> 00:03:22.233
and some of their time answering
the second kind of question.

00:03:22.233 --> 00:03:25.536
And importantly, those two questions
interact with one another.

00:03:25.536 --> 00:03:29.629
If you want to do a good job answering
"How does it work?" questions,

00:03:29.629 --> 00:03:34.795
it's a really good idea to do a good job
answering "What is it?" questions as well.

00:03:35.015 --> 00:03:36.815
The thing about the social sciences

00:03:36.815 --> 00:03:40.410
is we spend a lot of time
on "How does it work?" questions.

00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:42.400
But "What is it?" questions?

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:43.988
We don't really do that.

00:03:43.988 --> 00:03:47.361
What is money? What is a company?
What is an institution?

00:03:47.361 --> 00:03:48.981
What's a social group?

00:03:48.981 --> 00:03:51.612
What are credit cards,
financial instruments, contracts?

00:03:51.612 --> 00:03:54.892
These are questions we really
don't ask in social sciences.

00:03:54.892 --> 00:03:56.898
Here's an interesting comparison:

00:03:56.898 --> 00:04:01.225
I had a research associate
look at two of the top journals.

00:04:01.225 --> 00:04:04.466
One in the natural sciences
and one in the social sciences,

00:04:04.466 --> 00:04:07.424
Nature and the American Economic Review.

00:04:07.694 --> 00:04:12.012
We looked at the 400 or so articles
that came out over the last year

00:04:12.012 --> 00:04:15.675
and coded them in terms of what kind
of questions they were addressing.

00:04:15.675 --> 00:04:17.206
Here are the results:

00:04:17.376 --> 00:04:20.506
The blue bars represent Nature,
and as you can see,

00:04:20.506 --> 00:04:23.615
about 16 per cent
of the articles in Nature

00:04:23.615 --> 00:04:26.856
are addressing purely
"What is it?" questions.

00:04:26.856 --> 00:04:30.695
Then another 12 per cent
are addressing a mix of questions.

00:04:30.695 --> 00:04:33.668
The American Economic Review
is very different.

00:04:33.898 --> 00:04:36.517
Out of the 242 articles we looked at,

00:04:36.517 --> 00:04:40.557
only two of them are addressing
purely "What is it?" questions.

00:04:40.897 --> 00:04:43.659
And only 13 were even addressing a mix.

00:04:43.659 --> 00:04:46.589
These are things we're not really
paying attention to.

00:04:47.389 --> 00:04:52.490
Why do the natural sciences spend
so much time addressing these questions?

00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:54.710
Let me tell you a story about what happens

00:04:54.710 --> 00:04:58.889
if you get your answers
to "What is it?" questions wrong.

00:04:59.059 --> 00:05:03.080
This is a story from biology,
from the 1860s.

00:05:03.450 --> 00:05:06.570
But as you'll see, the things
that were going wrong then

00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:08.325
are remarkably similar

00:05:08.325 --> 00:05:11.848
to the things that are going wrong
in the social sciences today.

00:05:12.538 --> 00:05:14.999
Here's a guy named Rudolf Virchow.

00:05:15.419 --> 00:05:18.820
Back in the 19th century,
he was a very prominent biologist

00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:21.860
arguing for the cell theory of organisms.

00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:24.580
Now it may be hard to believe,
but at the time,

00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:28.331
there were a lot of debates about
what organisms like us are made of.

00:05:28.451 --> 00:05:32.292
Some people thought that we're made
of some stuff called protoplasm,

00:05:32.292 --> 00:05:33.543
whatever that is,

00:05:33.543 --> 00:05:35.672
some people thought
that we're made of fluids

00:05:35.672 --> 00:05:38.503
with a vital life force
flowing up and down us.

00:05:38.773 --> 00:05:41.538
Virchow argued for
the cell theory of organisms,

00:05:41.538 --> 00:05:44.575
and here are a couple
of the principles he put forward.

00:05:44.575 --> 00:05:48.135
One is: All organisms are made
exclusively out of cells.

00:05:48.615 --> 00:05:53.333
A second is: Cells are the functional
and structural units of organisms.

00:05:54.193 --> 00:05:56.382
Cell theory really is very good.

00:05:56.482 --> 00:05:59.726
It's much better
than life-force fluid theory.

00:05:59.726 --> 00:06:01.241
(Laughter)

00:06:01.631 --> 00:06:04.795
But the problem is it's not quite true.

00:06:05.405 --> 00:06:07.978
Think about a body.

00:06:08.228 --> 00:06:10.408
There are lots of cells in the body,

00:06:10.408 --> 00:06:13.908
but lots of parts of the body
are non-cellular as well.

00:06:13.908 --> 00:06:15.769
Think, for an instance, about the eye.

00:06:15.769 --> 00:06:19.239
There are lots of cells in the retina
or cells in the optic nerve,

00:06:19.969 --> 00:06:24.530
but most of the eye is non-cellular;
the cornea has almost no cells, the lens.

00:06:25.370 --> 00:06:29.680
Most of the eye, is the vitreous humor
and that also has almost no cells.

00:06:29.680 --> 00:06:33.188
The eye is an amazing structural
and functional device,

00:06:33.188 --> 00:06:35.159
and yet it's not made out of cells.

00:06:35.159 --> 00:06:38.350
The same is true for lots
of other parts of the body as well.

00:06:38.350 --> 00:06:40.930
The bones, 15 per cent of the body.

00:06:41.520 --> 00:06:44.785
The hair, the teeth,
all the fluids in the body.

00:06:44.785 --> 00:06:47.511
Virchow got the answer
to the "What is it?" question

00:06:47.511 --> 00:06:49.261
about the body wrong.

00:06:49.261 --> 00:06:52.751
It was too simple. It was too uniform.

00:06:53.501 --> 00:06:55.160
One more point about this:

00:06:55.160 --> 00:06:59.041
Suppose you want to use Virchow's answer
to "What is it?" questions

00:06:59.041 --> 00:07:01.741
to then answer
"How does it work?" questions.

00:07:01.741 --> 00:07:05.316
For instance, suppose you want
to construct a simulation,

00:07:05.316 --> 00:07:11.681
and in the simulation of the body
as a whole, you only simulate the cells.

00:07:11.681 --> 00:07:15.272
And you ignore, overlook,
all the non-cellular stuff.

00:07:16.012 --> 00:07:19.153
This will not be a good
simulation of the body.

00:07:19.623 --> 00:07:21.843
You might simulate a few things well.

00:07:21.843 --> 00:07:27.924
You might simulate the muscles well,
or you might simulate the organs well.

00:07:28.244 --> 00:07:31.693
But as a simulation of the body
as a whole, it will be terrible.

00:07:31.693 --> 00:07:34.746
You can probably predict
what's going to happen.

00:07:35.176 --> 00:07:38.045
(Laughter)

00:07:38.435 --> 00:07:40.623
With a bad answer
to "What is it?" questions,

00:07:40.623 --> 00:07:42.857
we don't have a prayer
of giving a good answer

00:07:42.857 --> 00:07:45.136
to "How does it work?" questions.

00:07:45.586 --> 00:07:49.768
There's an assumption that's deeply built
into the social sciences today,

00:07:49.768 --> 00:07:54.617
which is that the social world
is built exclusively out of people.

00:07:54.857 --> 00:07:56.197
What's an economy?

00:07:56.197 --> 00:07:58.861
It's a bunch of people
interacting with one another.

00:07:58.861 --> 00:07:59.991
What's a company?

00:07:59.991 --> 00:08:02.568
It's a bunch of people
interacting with one another.

00:08:02.568 --> 00:08:04.228
Let me give you three examples

00:08:04.228 --> 00:08:07.260
of cutting-edge social science
to illustrate this:

00:08:07.940 --> 00:08:12.650
Here's a picture I took from a recent book
on simulating corporations.

00:08:12.650 --> 00:08:17.073
As you can see, what they've done
in terms of organizing a simulation

00:08:17.073 --> 00:08:21.440
is to take people and then to cluster them
into hierarchies or groups.

00:08:21.710 --> 00:08:25.002
If you followed their instructions
for simulating a corporation,

00:08:25.002 --> 00:08:26.838
you are going to simulate the people.

00:08:26.838 --> 00:08:28.317
Nothing more.

00:08:29.037 --> 00:08:31.760
Here's an example
of a field of social science

00:08:31.760 --> 00:08:35.683
that's getting an enormous amount
of attention: social network theory.

00:08:36.343 --> 00:08:39.155
In this diagram, you can see
that a society as a whole

00:08:39.155 --> 00:08:41.285
is represented as a graph,

00:08:41.285 --> 00:08:44.916
with people at the nodes
and relations between people

00:08:44.916 --> 00:08:47.126
as the lines between the nodes.

00:08:47.126 --> 00:08:51.145
The society as a whole is represented
by people and their relationships,

00:08:51.145 --> 00:08:52.994
nothing more.

00:08:54.124 --> 00:08:57.595
Or general equilibrium
theory in economics.

00:08:58.055 --> 00:09:01.386
This is the workhorse of economic theory,

00:09:01.386 --> 00:09:04.266
it's what macro-economists
spend much of their time doing.

00:09:04.266 --> 00:09:07.852
These models are slightly more complicated
in terms of their building blocks

00:09:07.852 --> 00:09:09.485
than the ones I just showed you,

00:09:09.485 --> 00:09:11.895
but not much more,
they're still very simple.

00:09:11.895 --> 00:09:15.789
They start with a group of people,
or what they call "A cohort of agents,"

00:09:15.789 --> 00:09:18.135
then they add just
a few more building blocks.

00:09:18.135 --> 00:09:20.125
They add some resources,

00:09:20.585 --> 00:09:23.816
they add some firms
which are basically understood

00:09:23.816 --> 00:09:28.221
as "black boxes that take inputs
and transform them into outputs,"

00:09:28.221 --> 00:09:31.816
and then they sometimes will add
a government or some bonds.

00:09:31.816 --> 00:09:35.385
A little more complicated
but still very simple.

00:09:36.395 --> 00:09:40.338
I was talking to an economist
the other day, and he was like:

00:09:40.818 --> 00:09:44.061
"Sure, society is built out of people,

00:09:44.061 --> 00:09:47.957
and these are the building blocks
of our model, but what else is there?

00:09:47.957 --> 00:09:52.598
Are you suggesting that there's some sort
of dark matter in the social world

00:09:52.598 --> 00:09:54.640
that we're not really representing?

00:09:54.640 --> 00:09:57.036
Some invisible stuff we can't see?"

00:09:57.036 --> 00:09:59.159
Now I've gotten this reaction quite a bit,

00:09:59.159 --> 00:10:02.748
but whenever I get it,
I'm always kind of puzzled

00:10:02.748 --> 00:10:05.599
because there is no dark matter.

00:10:05.859 --> 00:10:08.558
All we need to do is look around us.

00:10:08.558 --> 00:10:10.218
Look around you right now.

00:10:10.218 --> 00:10:13.459
Sure you see some people,
but there's a lot more than people.

00:10:13.459 --> 00:10:17.058
Or look in your company.
Or look in your university.

00:10:17.058 --> 00:10:19.009
Or in your living room, or your car,

00:10:19.009 --> 00:10:21.939
or look at your wallet,
at the bills and cards in your wallet.

00:10:21.939 --> 00:10:26.649
Each one of these things is built
on a complex hierarchy of parts.

00:10:27.439 --> 00:10:28.679
To see this vividly,

00:10:28.679 --> 00:10:30.969
think about the building blocks
of an economy.

00:10:30.969 --> 00:10:32.851
Or maybe that's too complicated.

00:10:32.851 --> 00:10:35.390
Think about the building blocks
of a single company.

00:10:35.390 --> 00:10:36.692
Or less complicated,

00:10:36.692 --> 00:10:39.641
think about the building blocks
of the company's balance sheet.

00:10:39.641 --> 00:10:41.882
Or even one account.

00:10:41.882 --> 00:10:45.393
Or even simpler,
think about my bank account.

00:10:46.363 --> 00:10:51.275
As you can see from this ATM receipt,
I have a $78 balance in my bank account.

00:10:51.275 --> 00:10:52.404
(Laughter)

00:10:52.404 --> 00:10:56.466
This is what you get for going to academia
instead of Silicon Valley.

00:10:56.466 --> 00:10:58.524
(Laughter)

00:10:58.524 --> 00:11:01.335
So what are the building blocks of that?

00:11:01.335 --> 00:11:04.675
Well partly, it's actions
by me, a person -

00:11:04.675 --> 00:11:06.155
my deposits and my withdrawals,

00:11:06.155 --> 00:11:08.258
maybe interacting
with tellers and machines -

00:11:08.258 --> 00:11:11.256
but there's a lot more
behind it than just that.

00:11:11.256 --> 00:11:14.707
For instance, in order for me
to have that bank balance,

00:11:14.707 --> 00:11:17.755
Bank of America needs to be
a depository institution,

00:11:17.755 --> 00:11:19.486
it has to be able to take deposits.

00:11:19.486 --> 00:11:23.194
And that depends on an enormous
hierarchy of complicated stuff.

00:11:23.194 --> 00:11:25.437
It partly depends on their employees,

00:11:25.437 --> 00:11:27.816
but it also depends
on things like licenses,

00:11:27.816 --> 00:11:30.535
which have lots of complicated
terms and conditions,

00:11:30.535 --> 00:11:32.866
and those conditions
have their own dependencies.

00:11:32.866 --> 00:11:34.812
Then there are things like bank capital,

00:11:34.812 --> 00:11:37.668
and relationships with other banks
like the Federal Reserve,

00:11:37.668 --> 00:11:39.805
which then has it's own dependencies.

00:11:39.805 --> 00:11:41.591
And there's more.

00:11:41.591 --> 00:11:44.738
For instance, the Bank of America
needs to be solvent.

00:11:44.738 --> 00:11:48.338
For it to be solvent, depends
on it's capital and on its loan portfolio,

00:11:48.338 --> 00:11:49.998
and deposits and other stuff.

00:11:49.998 --> 00:11:51.158
Or if it's not solvent,

00:11:51.158 --> 00:11:53.792
then there's the FDIC,
which has its own dependencies.

00:11:53.792 --> 00:11:56.912
The point is not the details
of this particular example.

00:11:57.832 --> 00:12:00.681
The point is that what looks like
a very simple fact

00:12:00.681 --> 00:12:05.002
is actually built out of a complicated
and heterogeneous set of building blocks.

00:12:05.002 --> 00:12:08.303
And that is just one guy's bank account.

00:12:08.793 --> 00:12:10.373
Think about a company.

00:12:10.373 --> 00:12:12.174
Think about an economy.

00:12:12.174 --> 00:12:16.414
The idea that these things are built
exclusively out of people is crazy.

00:12:17.194 --> 00:12:21.274
What do we do when we encounter
something like the financial crisis?

00:12:21.274 --> 00:12:25.166
We want to understand what happened,
we want to understand how it works.

00:12:25.906 --> 00:12:27.036
But to understand that,

00:12:27.036 --> 00:12:30.115
we need to understand
the mechanisms behind the parts of that.

00:12:30.115 --> 00:12:31.937
And in order to understand that,

00:12:31.937 --> 00:12:34.937
we need to understand
what those parts are.

00:12:34.937 --> 00:12:37.117
This is something
we have to take seriously,

00:12:37.117 --> 00:12:42.778
at least as seriously as we take DNA
in the natural sciences.

00:12:43.328 --> 00:12:46.122
It's not that social scientists are blind.

00:12:46.122 --> 00:12:50.952
They can look around them and see
that the world is a complicated place.

00:12:51.822 --> 00:12:53.032
But what they're doing

00:12:53.032 --> 00:12:56.333
is they think that society is made
exclusively out of people,

00:12:56.333 --> 00:12:59.355
and so it interacts
with the other parts of the world.

00:12:59.355 --> 00:13:03.375
So you come up with this clean separation
of society and people here,

00:13:03.375 --> 00:13:05.977
and resources here
and firms here, and so on.

00:13:05.977 --> 00:13:10.415
But if you just take one glance
at this complicated hierarchy,

00:13:10.415 --> 00:13:12.435
it's clear that
couldn't possibly be right.

00:13:12.435 --> 00:13:16.335
There is no way of pulling out
and separating the people in our models.

00:13:17.435 --> 00:13:21.596
Our approach to the social world overall
is too centered on people;

00:13:22.026 --> 00:13:26.007
it's too people-centric,
too anthropocentric.

00:13:26.847 --> 00:13:32.778
500 years ago, Copernicus argued against
anthropocentrism, about the solar system.

00:13:33.958 --> 00:13:38.038
Before Copernicus, astronomers
couldn't imagine a universe

00:13:38.038 --> 00:13:40.539
where people weren't right at the center.

00:13:41.929 --> 00:13:44.499
Those astronomers, of course,
were proven wrong.

00:13:44.499 --> 00:13:46.858
We are part of the universe,

00:13:46.858 --> 00:13:49.409
but we are not at the center
of the universe.

00:13:49.409 --> 00:13:52.041
Amazingly, 500 years later,

00:13:52.041 --> 00:13:56.930
the social sciences are still relying
on a similar kind of assumption.

00:13:57.340 --> 00:13:59.709
But this is not the way it has to be.

00:13:59.709 --> 00:14:03.720
We don't have to labor under the dogmas
of an earlier generation.

00:14:03.720 --> 00:14:06.222
All we need to do is take
the "What is it?" questions

00:14:06.222 --> 00:14:10.402
even half as seriously in social science
as we do in the natural sciences,

00:14:10.402 --> 00:14:13.214
and we have the potential
to make some real progress.

00:14:13.214 --> 00:14:15.421
Here's some steps we can take.

00:14:15.421 --> 00:14:18.162
First: We have to recognize the problem.

00:14:18.162 --> 00:14:21.301
There's no way that we are going
to improve this stuff until we see

00:14:21.301 --> 00:14:26.002
that "What is it?" questions are important
and that we are not addressing them well.

00:14:26.442 --> 00:14:31.130
Also, critical, is to go beyond
just thinking about psychology.

00:14:31.520 --> 00:14:35.312
Lots of people are thinking about
how to fix the social sciences,

00:14:35.312 --> 00:14:38.274
but by large the way they are doing it

00:14:38.274 --> 00:14:41.493
is by improving our models
of the human psyche.

00:14:41.493 --> 00:14:45.733
For instance, the biggest trend, by far,
in the social sciences today

00:14:45.733 --> 00:14:49.455
is taking account of the fact
that people are not always rational.

00:14:49.455 --> 00:14:51.130
Sometimes we are irrational.

00:14:51.130 --> 00:14:53.986
Now, this is something
we've known for a very long time,

00:14:54.856 --> 00:14:58.795
but people are starting to systematically
incorporate it into their models.

00:14:58.795 --> 00:15:00.505
This is a good thing.

00:15:00.505 --> 00:15:02.244
It's a good thing for people to do.

00:15:02.244 --> 00:15:03.765
But we have to understand

00:15:03.765 --> 00:15:06.895
that even if we got
the human psyche perfect,

00:15:06.895 --> 00:15:11.126
we're still only addressing
a small fraction of the social world.

00:15:12.466 --> 00:15:14.637
Second: We need to experiment.

00:15:14.637 --> 00:15:17.257
We need to try things out
in a variety of places,

00:15:17.257 --> 00:15:21.070
this is not a task for big science
to try to do a moonshot.

00:15:21.070 --> 00:15:24.536
It's a task for a lot of us
to experiment and build on things.

00:15:24.536 --> 00:15:26.168
We're very much at the beginning

00:15:26.168 --> 00:15:28.988
of understanding the nature
of the social world.

00:15:28.988 --> 00:15:33.318
A lot of different people and disciplines
need to start contributing to it.

00:15:34.339 --> 00:15:38.099
And thirdly: We need to build out
our intellectual infrastructure,

00:15:38.099 --> 00:15:40.978
and we need to build out
our modelling infrastructure.

00:15:40.978 --> 00:15:42.519
I come from philosophy,

00:15:42.519 --> 00:15:45.100
and in recent years,
we've made some huge strides

00:15:45.100 --> 00:15:48.367
in cracking some of these problems
about the social world.

00:15:48.367 --> 00:15:50.731
But still, we're only just starting.

00:15:50.731 --> 00:15:54.971
And of course, philosophy's just one place
where this needs to happen.

00:15:54.971 --> 00:15:57.361
It needs to happen in the social sciences.

00:15:57.361 --> 00:16:02.030
Modelling infrastructure needs to be built
in computer science and in mathematics,

00:16:02.290 --> 00:16:06.183
and examples need to be drawn
from business and from the humanities.

00:16:06.183 --> 00:16:08.702
Let me conclude by saying
that this is not something

00:16:08.702 --> 00:16:11.981
that we are going to solve
in a day or a week or a month.

00:16:11.981 --> 00:16:17.252
It's an ongoing project in social science,
just as it is in natural science.

00:16:18.192 --> 00:16:21.431
But even if we can make
small strides, little by little,

00:16:21.431 --> 00:16:23.292
it can have an enormous impact.

00:16:23.292 --> 00:16:26.061
The stakes are huge
in the social sciences.

00:16:26.061 --> 00:16:28.440
And if we can start making improvements,

00:16:28.440 --> 00:16:31.852
we just might find that after years
and years and years of effort,

00:16:31.852 --> 00:16:34.601
that we can finally draw
on the social sciences

00:16:34.601 --> 00:16:38.422
to solve some of the most
pressing problems of our time.

00:16:38.422 --> 00:16:39.787
Thank you.

00:16:39.787 --> 00:16:41.822
(Applause)
