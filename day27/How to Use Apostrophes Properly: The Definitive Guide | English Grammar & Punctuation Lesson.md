WEBVTT Kind: captions Language: en 

hello everyone and welcome back to english with lucy. today, after all of your requests I'm doing a grammar video and I wanted to talk to you about something that even I an English teacher struggle with sometimes it's something I have to use every single day it is punctuation and I have always really struggled with apostrophes and when and when not to use them apostrophes follow loads of rules and I see them misused all of the time I know that sometimes I might misuse them as well but I think today we should just clarify all of our doubts and use apostrophes properly once and for all I really do think this video is going to help anybody who needs to write frequently anyone who's going to take an English exam like the IELTS or the FCE or even the CAE anyone who needs to write emails

one free on I talk you lessons all you have to do is click on the link in the description box that being said let's get started with the punctuation lesson so how's this lesson going to be structured well first I'm going to be talking about the possessive case the genitive case where apostrophes show possession or a relationship between two things I'm then going to show you how apostrophes are used in verb pronoun and some noun contractions and then finally I'll show you some extra `miscellaneous` contractions using `apostrophes` as well let's get started so let's talk about the possessive case normally it uses apostrophe s but there are some exceptions this shows possession a relationship between two things normally with one thing belonging to the other for example the ball of the dog the dog's ball so how do we use them with singular nouns well we just add apostrophe s for example Lucy's car is orange or I ate dinner at Will's house but what happens if those singular nouns end in s now this is a little bit of a cause for `dispute` in the English grammar world but the most accepted form is to add apostrophe s as well now this is `disputed` and some people will argue that we should just add the apostrophe whatever you choose to do make it consistent choose one of those rules and be consistent with it so at least it looks like you know what you're doing so I personally like to stick with the apostrophe s because I think it's the most traditional for example the actresses role was difficult or Jess's dog is called Mable now with the other rule where they just put the apostrophe and they don't put the S you will still treat it in spoken English as if you had that s there so you will still say Jess's dog is called Mable and the actresses role was difficult even though the S is not there it's complicated so what about plural nouns well regular plural nouns usually end in s and for these two show possession you just need to add an apostrophe to the end of them for example my grandparents house is cozy or my friends party was amazing now this is why English is a little bit difficult because if I say these two sentences my friends party was amazing or my friends party was amazing the first one is just referring to one friend and the second one is referring to two friends the apostrophe has changed place but it sounds the same in spoken English that's why you need to add a bit of context in the words of Coldplay nobody said it was easy but what about those plural nouns that don't end in s for example children well liked the singular nouns we just add apostrophe s so the children's clothing is to your left or the women's party is starting now these examples are less complicated because the plural and singular version of those nouns sound different on their own but if you had a noun like sheep you have one sheep two sheep well it gets a bit more complicated because as we explained in the last example it sounds the same okay so we've cleared up where to use apostrophe and where to use apostrophe s and the general consensus is add apostrophe s to everything apart from regular plural nouns that end in s and for those we just add the apostrophe one important thing to note is that sometimes that second noun isn't necessary you don't have to repeat yourself for example my house is smaller than my parents house I could just say my house is smaller than my parents the meaning is clear I'm not trying to say that my house is smaller in size that my parents are in size I'm trying to say that my house is smaller my parents house which is bigger the meaning is more or less clear so we don't have to repeat ourselves with that second house now what happens if one object has more than one owner what if Ali and I were to buy a cat together would it be Lucy's and Ali's cat or Lucy and Ali's cat well if we are both the owner it would be Lucy and Ali's cat because the last person in the list takes the possessive form however if they are similar items that are owned individually say I have a cat and Ali has a cat it would be Lucy's and Ali's cats I have cats Ali has cats Lucy's and Ali's cats okay so that section on the possessive case should now be clear if it's still not clear you can re-watch the section and then go on to comment any doubts you have in the comments below and I will try and help but I also really encourage you to help out each other as well now let's talk about apostrophes with verb contractions I have got five of the most common situations in which verb contractions are used with apostrophes so an apostrophe in a verb contraction basically shows missing letters for example I am I'm that apostrophe is showing that missing a and the space it also gives you an indication on pronunciation example number one verbs plus not for example do not don't cannot can't could not couldn't should not shouldn't the second example pronouns and will I will I'll she will she'll they will Vale the third one and this one can be slightly more complicated pronouns and nouns with to be for example I am I'm you are your will is wills so if you look at wills on its own it could be showing the possessive case or it could be showing a contraction of the verb to be wills watching television it is wills television one of them is will plus to be and the other one is showing that the television is the television of will it is wills television one thing to note is with who who's with the apostrophe is who is who plus to be who's there who's spelt WH o s e is the possessive form whose bag is this it's very important to remember that especially when you're writing in exams it's an incredibly common mistake especially amongst native speakers I have absolutely made the mistake in the past but I'm really going to try and not make the mistake in the future number four is pronouns plus the verb to have I have I've she has she's so she's could be she is or she has you have to look at the context note though it would not be confused with the possessive because the possessive would be hers the last one number five pronouns plus wood or hat for example I had I'd now we would use this in situations like I'd better go I had better go we wouldn't say I'd a dog when I was 12 I had a dog when I was 12 and then with would I would do that I do that in everyday conversation the apostrophe D can be used with nouns like Oh Mahmoud love that mum would love that or Sophia eat that Sophie would eat that so those are the five most common contractions now just like to quickly cover three others that are not so common but still really important and you will definitely come across them so the first situation is when we talk about years but we drop a couple of the numbers for example the summer of 69 we know that we're talking about 1969 but we might just want to say 69 it's more common to use this when describing the 1900s the next situation is where we drop the words of for example two o'clock originally it was of or in the surname Donovan it would have likely been of Donovan originally the last situation is to show pronunciation in dialogue for example come on could be changed to come on and we'd use an apostrophe in that to give guidance on how to pronounce it come on is different to come on isn't it right guys that is it for my grammar lesson on apostrophes I really hope you
