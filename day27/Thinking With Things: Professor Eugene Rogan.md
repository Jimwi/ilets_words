00:00:03.680 --> 00:00:06.300
As Professor of Modern Middle Eastern History at Oxford

00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:07.960
I've worked extensively on the First World War

00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:09.060
in the Middle East.

00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:10.800
While I've always tried to privilege

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:12.980
Arab and Turkish accounts of the war,

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:14.680
the figure of T.E. Lawrence,

00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:16.760
better known as Lawrence of Arabia,

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:18.760
looms too large to neglect.

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:20.780
I can't tell you how many of my students over

00:00:20.780 --> 00:00:23.560
the past quarter century have been inspired to

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:25.520
study the Middle East out of fascination with

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:26.640
the Lawrence legend.

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:28.740
I'm not immune myself,

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:31.040
every time I visit the Ashmolean

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:33.420
I find myself drawn to the display case

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:35.280
with his Arab robes.

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:38.340
And therein lies a tale that Lawrence himself tells,

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:41.220
in his classic account 'The Seven Pillars of Wisdom'.

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:44.540
At the height of the First World War Lawrence seized

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:46.760
the opportunity to trade his desk job in the

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:48.720
Arab Bureau in Cairo to serve as

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:51.580
British Liaison to the Arab revolt and the Red

00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:53.240
Sea province of the Hejaz.

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:56.100
Lawrence never really took to the

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:58.920
standard British officers uniform; his superiors

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:01.500
always commented on his disregard for regulation.

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:05.300
As Ronald Storrs recalled in his book 'Orientations':

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:08.640
"His sand brown belt was as often as not buckled loose

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:12.580
over his unbuttoned shoulder straps, or he would forget

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:15.120
to put it on at all. Once at least I had to send my

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:17.780
servant running with it after him into the street".

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:21.480
Yet in the Hejaz, Lawrence always stood out among the

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:23.660
Arab tribesmen in his scruffy English

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:25.140
khakis and puttees.

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:28.900
His uniform provoked the suspicions of the Bedouin

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:32.080
as Lawrence reflected in 'The Seven Pillars of Wisdom:

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:34.920
"The only wearers of khaki in their experience

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:37.000
had been Turkish officers, before whom

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:38.640
they took up an instinctive defence".

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:41.360
When the commander of the Arab army

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:43.160
Emir Faisal I bin Hussein

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:45.720
suggested that he might dress in Arab clothes,

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:48.100
Lawrence agreed in a flash.

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:50.620
As he wrote in the Seven Pillars:

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:53.440
"Army uniform was abominable when camel riding,

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:56.040
or when sitting about on the ground, and the Arab

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:58.660
things were cleaner and more decent in the desert.

00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:01.000
Besides, the tribesmen would then understand

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.680
how to take me. If I wore Meccan clothes

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:06.540
they would behave to me as though I were really one of

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:08.920
the leaders, and I might slip in and out of

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:11.680
Faisal's tent without making a sensation,

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:14.680
which he had to explain away each time to strangers".

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:18.020
If Faisal had intended for Lawrence to fit in,

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:20.340
he could hardly have given the young Englishman

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:23.080
a worse set of clothes, and Lawrence was

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:24.940
delighted with what he wrote:

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:27.160
"With the splendid white silk and gold

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:29.180
embroidered wedding garments which had

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:30.880
been sent to Faisal lately

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:34.100
(was it a hint?) by his great-aunt in Mecca".

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:37.980
Lawrence must have stood out among the tribesmen,

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:41.260
their uncoloured robes, like a pearl among oysters.

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:44.000
No sooner had he changed into Faisal's wedding suit

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.220
than Lawrence, quote: "took a stroll in the new

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:48.800
looseness of them around the palm gardens at Mubarak

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:51.600
and Bruka to accustom myself to their feel".

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:54.740
It's a moment that David Lean captured with comic

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:58.120
effect in his 1962 classic 'Lawrence of Arabia'.

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:02.360
In the course of the Arab revolt Lawrence accumulated

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:04.620
something of a wardrobe of Bedouin robes

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:07.100
The Ashmolean holds a number of suits of his Arab clothing.

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:10.640
Yet these white robes, which he managed to keep

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:12.720
right through the course of the war,

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:14.660
and which he described in such a loving detail in

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:16.140
'The Seven Pillars of Wisdom',

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:18.560
must have been his favourites.
