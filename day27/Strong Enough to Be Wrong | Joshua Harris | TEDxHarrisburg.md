00:00:05.509 --> 00:00:07.123
I have a question for you.

00:00:08.343 --> 00:00:10.465
Is admitting you're wrong

00:00:11.665 --> 00:00:13.802
a sign of weakness

00:00:14.464 --> 00:00:16.275
or a sign of strength?

00:00:18.113 --> 00:00:22.483
And how hard is it for you to consider
that you've gotten something wrong?

00:00:22.523 --> 00:00:25.423
I'm not talking about small areas.

00:00:25.773 --> 00:00:27.673
What about when the stakes are high?

00:00:28.356 --> 00:00:33.306
When what you've gotten wrong
could affect your livelihood,

00:00:33.833 --> 00:00:36.169
or your involvement in a community,

00:00:36.679 --> 00:00:39.349
or even your own sense of identity?

00:00:40.049 --> 00:00:43.149
I wish that these questions
were just theoretical,

00:00:43.176 --> 00:00:45.066
but for me, they're very real,

00:00:45.086 --> 00:00:48.398
very right-now questions
that I am wrestling with

00:00:48.428 --> 00:00:50.107
in a very public way.

00:00:50.378 --> 00:00:53.498
So let me tell you 
a little bit of my journey.

00:00:53.528 --> 00:00:58.388
I could take you to the exact spot,
in my parents living room,

00:00:58.408 --> 00:01:00.335
in Gresham, Oregon,

00:01:00.355 --> 00:01:03.712
where I knelt down
and I prayed this prayer,

00:01:04.085 --> 00:01:09.065
"God, let me write a book
that will change the world."

00:01:10.092 --> 00:01:11.732
Be careful what you pray for!

00:01:11.752 --> 00:01:12.776
(Chuckles)

00:01:12.806 --> 00:01:15.619
I was 20 years old, I was young,

00:01:15.639 --> 00:01:19.109
I was religiously zealous, I was certain

00:01:19.139 --> 00:01:21.159
and I was restlessly ambitious.

00:01:21.792 --> 00:01:25.642
Youth, zeal, certainty, ambition -

00:01:26.207 --> 00:01:29.337
Not unlike the ingredients
of the Molotov cocktail,

00:01:29.367 --> 00:01:32.487
they have the tendency
to set the world on fire.

00:01:32.679 --> 00:01:36.269
And, in my little corner of the world,
that's exactly what happened,

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:39.129
because, incredibly,
my prayer was answered.

00:01:39.149 --> 00:01:44.199
I did write a book,
it was published and it exploded!

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:47.380
It started to sell and sell and sell.

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:50.560
The publisher kept writing me, saying:
"We're going back to print."

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:54.142
It was selling tens of thousands
of copies every month.

00:01:54.162 --> 00:01:57.432
I remember the day that I went 
into my local Christian book store,

00:01:57.452 --> 00:01:59.716
and there was my book,

00:01:59.735 --> 00:02:02.515
the number one,
bestselling book in the country.

00:02:02.535 --> 00:02:04.815
And it stayed there for months.

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:07.950
I was on national radio shows,

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:10.740
newspaper articles were being
written about me and my book.

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:13.880
The pinnacle of my 15 min of fame

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:16.870
was when I was on
the Bill Maher television show,

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:20.614
sitting across from a young actor
named Ben Affleck.

00:02:20.804 --> 00:02:23.634
I had a conversation with Batman.

00:02:24.064 --> 00:02:25.244
(Laughter)

00:02:25.274 --> 00:02:29.500
My book went on to sell
over 1,2 million copies

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:32.229
and was translated
into dozens of languages.

00:02:32.249 --> 00:02:33.549
Now,

00:02:33.569 --> 00:02:37.959
if you were not a part
of the Evangelical Christian subculture

00:02:37.989 --> 00:02:39.039
in the late 1990s,

00:02:39.059 --> 00:02:41.669
you will not have heard
anything about my book.

00:02:41.699 --> 00:02:44.269
But, if you were growing up
in that environment,

00:02:44.289 --> 00:02:48.269
there is a sense in which my book
did change your world.

00:02:48.289 --> 00:02:50.960
Now, some people would say,
"For the better,"

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:54.000
but there are a lot of people
who would say, "For the worst."

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:57.250
And there are some that are
still really pissed off about that.

00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:01.160
My book was called: 
"I Kissed Dating Goodbye -

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:05.100
A new attitude towards 
relationships and romance."

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:06.820
I was writing to fellow Christians.

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:09.130
I saying: "We need to be
serious about our faith,

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:13.050
and if we're serious about our faith,
we won't have sex until we're married,

00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:14.940
and if we want to avoid premarital sex,

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:17.600
then we should radically
change our lifestyle,

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:19.680
and that means we should stop dating.

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:21.010
Dating is the problem.

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:24.020
Dating is a distraction,
it's preparation for divorce,

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:25.840
it leads to temptation."

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:31.820
(Laughter)

00:03:31.843 --> 00:03:34.063
I was 21. I knew a lot, okay?

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:35.910
(Laughter)

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:41.490
I should probably mention at this point
that I'd been homeschooled my whole life

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:44.630
and I'd only been in one
serious relationship at this point.

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:45.727
(Laughter)

00:03:45.747 --> 00:03:48.310
Now, you know, there were
some things about this book

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:50.580
that I still think are good.

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:52.790
Some people were helped by the reminder

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:56.480
that you don't have to be in a dating
relationship to be a complete person.

00:03:56.510 --> 00:03:59.790
Some people were helped to realize
they could take a break from dating

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:02.000
and focus on personal development.

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:05.573
And I still think that there's a lot
that takes place in modern dating

00:04:05.593 --> 00:04:07.712
that can be really selfish and harmful,

00:04:07.732 --> 00:04:10.379
and some of that needs to be challenged.

00:04:10.692 --> 00:04:15.032
But my eyes have really been open
in the last few years,

00:04:15.062 --> 00:04:20.416
to see some fundamental problems 
in the book that I wrote.

00:04:20.436 --> 00:04:24.566
You know, I didn't leave room for the idea
that dating could be a healthy way

00:04:24.586 --> 00:04:28.796
of learning what you're looking for
in a long-term relationship,

00:04:28.826 --> 00:04:31.476
that it could be a part
of growing personally.

00:04:31.506 --> 00:04:32.926
I made that the focus,

00:04:32.956 --> 00:04:37.106
I gave the impression that there was
really one formula that you coild follow,

00:04:37.136 --> 00:04:40.646
and if you followed that,
then you would be happily married,

00:04:40.676 --> 00:04:42.108
God would bless you

00:04:42.128 --> 00:04:44.838
and you'd have a great
sex life and marriage.

00:04:44.858 --> 00:04:47.748
Obviously, the real world
doesn't work that way.

00:04:48.074 --> 00:04:51.054
But probably the thing
that I regret the most

00:04:51.084 --> 00:04:53.704
is that there was
a lot of fear inside of me

00:04:53.734 --> 00:04:56.560
that I transferred into my writing,

00:04:57.210 --> 00:04:59.170
and fear is never a good motive:

00:04:59.660 --> 00:05:02.240
fear of messing up,

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:04.460
fear of getting your heart broken,

00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:06.010
fear of hurting somebody else,

00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:07.420
fear of sex.

00:05:09.259 --> 00:05:10.509
(Sigh)

00:05:11.038 --> 00:05:12.278
Yeah.

00:05:15.948 --> 00:05:18.658
Why did it take me so long
to see these problems?

00:05:19.793 --> 00:05:23.343
You know, I think it was because 
I was so afraid of being wrong!

00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:29.000
You know, that book had made me
a best-selling author,

00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:31.130
it had given me an identity,

00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:34.230
it had make me slightly famous,

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:38.117
and it was so easy to just write
the critics off as haters,

00:05:38.137 --> 00:05:39.707
you know, "Those are the haters,"

00:05:39.727 --> 00:05:43.767
and then find people who liked my book
and hide behind them.

00:05:43.787 --> 00:05:46.167
And isn't that the great thing
about the Internet?

00:05:46.197 --> 00:05:48.107
No matter who you are or what you think,

00:05:48.127 --> 00:05:50.967
you could find someone
on the Internet that agrees with you.

00:05:50.997 --> 00:05:52.391
You could literally be Hitler

00:05:52.421 --> 00:05:54.871
and find people who think
you're doing a good job.

00:05:57.861 --> 00:06:01.049
But it was so hard for me
to face up to being wrong

00:06:01.059 --> 00:06:06.959
because it felt like I would be saying
that a big part of my life was wrong,

00:06:06.979 --> 00:06:08.989
and I didn't have courage to do that.

00:06:09.375 --> 00:06:13.775
What helped me to begin
to let my guard down

00:06:13.795 --> 00:06:15.395
was, a few years ago,

00:06:15.415 --> 00:06:20.065
I stopped being the pastor of a large
church and I went back to school.

00:06:20.085 --> 00:06:22.120
I went to graduate school

00:06:22.130 --> 00:06:25.700
and I stopped having to be
constantly right about everything

00:06:25.720 --> 00:06:28.100
and defend all these different ideas,

00:06:28.120 --> 00:06:30.710
and I just became a student
who was listening.

00:06:30.730 --> 00:06:33.980
And I developed relationships
with my fellow students,

00:06:34.010 --> 00:06:37.980
and a lot of them started to share stories
with me about the effect my book had had.

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:40.100
And many times
this was a negative effect,

00:06:40.120 --> 00:06:45.007
and I couldn't just write them off
as angry trolls on the Internet.

00:06:45.027 --> 00:06:48.037
These were my friends, and so I listened.

00:06:48.647 --> 00:06:54.277
And then one day, on Twitter, 
of all places, this woman wrote me,

00:06:54.297 --> 00:06:59.562
and she said, "Your book
was used against me like a weapon."

00:07:00.972 --> 00:07:03.252
And I almost didn't answer her

00:07:03.282 --> 00:07:06.202
because I was afraid
she would lash out at me,

00:07:06.667 --> 00:07:08.347
but in this particular day,

00:07:08.837 --> 00:07:11.257
I just answered and said, "I'm so sorry,"

00:07:11.967 --> 00:07:15.897
such a simple human interaction.

00:07:16.707 --> 00:07:19.887
And that interaction
led to a conversation,

00:07:20.377 --> 00:07:22.727
and that conversation led to a friendship,

00:07:22.757 --> 00:07:24.717
and that friendship changed me.

00:07:24.737 --> 00:07:26.987
She said something to me
that I'll never forget.

00:07:27.007 --> 00:07:30.167
She told me that
that back and forth on Twitter

00:07:30.637 --> 00:07:33.507
was the first time that a religious leader

00:07:33.537 --> 00:07:35.897
had ever acknowledged
getting something wrong,

00:07:35.917 --> 00:07:37.698
and ever apologized to her.

00:07:38.378 --> 00:07:40.488
And I heard that and I just thought,

00:07:40.508 --> 00:07:43.438
"There's something 
really unhealthy about this."

00:07:43.818 --> 00:07:49.108
That led me to open up my website
and invite people to share their stories,

00:07:49.128 --> 00:07:50.538
the effect my book had had,

00:07:50.568 --> 00:07:55.048
and we just published them
uncensored on the website.

00:07:55.068 --> 00:07:58.268
Some of those were stories of people
having a positive experience,

00:07:58.288 --> 00:08:00.158
but others were heart-wrenching.

00:08:00.188 --> 00:08:03.388
Others were from people 
who were really angry and hurt.

00:08:03.408 --> 00:08:08.138
And now I'm in this process of working
with a fellow student at my grad school

00:08:08.158 --> 00:08:11.438
who was a woman who was hurt 
by my book, growing up,

00:08:11.458 --> 00:08:13.538
and we're producing a documentary

00:08:13.558 --> 00:08:18.578
that's sharing the journey
of me going back and looking at the book,

00:08:18.598 --> 00:08:20.448
but also trying to tell a bigger story

00:08:20.468 --> 00:08:24.028
about how religious communities
talk about sexuality,

00:08:24.058 --> 00:08:25.458
and talk about relationships

00:08:25.488 --> 00:08:27.748
and what it looks like
to face up to moments

00:08:27.768 --> 00:08:31.238
when we don't get everything right,
even when we're well-intentioned.

00:08:31.268 --> 00:08:35.128
We crowdfunded this 
and we're giving the film away online,

00:08:35.148 --> 00:08:37.858
and hoping it will be helpful to someone.

00:08:37.887 --> 00:08:41.217
It's been such an emotional
roller coaster for me, though.

00:08:41.247 --> 00:08:43.807
You know, there are moments
where I feel contrite,

00:08:43.837 --> 00:08:46.937
and then other moments
where I swing over and I'm defensive

00:08:46.967 --> 00:08:50.177
and I'm mad that people
are blaming me for things,

00:08:50.207 --> 00:08:54.587
and a lot of times I just want
to run away from the whole process.

00:08:55.212 --> 00:08:57.152
But the reason I don't

00:08:57.182 --> 00:09:01.442
is because I believe that this is
the pathway of growth for me,

00:09:01.802 --> 00:09:07.742
that I'm going to learn things
in facing up to what I got wrong

00:09:07.772 --> 00:09:10.552
that I won't be able
to learn any other way.

00:09:11.173 --> 00:09:14.593
I'm discovering that there is
transformational power

00:09:15.263 --> 00:09:17.513
in admitting that you got something wrong.

00:09:17.828 --> 00:09:20.878
A couple of things
that I'm learning in the process.

00:09:21.244 --> 00:09:27.572
First, I'm learning that evolution
always involves death.

00:09:28.222 --> 00:09:31.542
You know, we talk about
how we want to evolve personally.

00:09:31.562 --> 00:09:33.482
That sounds great, right?

00:09:33.502 --> 00:09:34.912
It sounds sophisticated.

00:09:34.942 --> 00:09:36.842
I mean, who doesn't want to become

00:09:36.872 --> 00:09:42.412
a smarter, stronger, more loving,
compassionate version of themselves?

00:09:42.432 --> 00:09:47.732
We all want to evolve personally,
but think about what evolution requires,

00:09:47.752 --> 00:09:50.892
when you think about the evolution
of the species over generations.

00:09:50.912 --> 00:09:53.342
There's a lot of death that takes place!

00:09:53.362 --> 00:09:55.822
Natural selection is a traumatic thing.

00:09:55.842 --> 00:09:57.862
We talk about the survival of the fittest,

00:09:57.882 --> 00:10:01.872
but think about all those that were not
the fittest, that did not survive?

00:10:01.902 --> 00:10:03.492
There is death involved.

00:10:03.872 --> 00:10:07.902
And why should we think that
personal evolution would be any different?

00:10:07.922 --> 00:10:11.876
It's never this painless, clean process.

00:10:12.376 --> 00:10:15.056
There is a type of death involved.

00:10:15.696 --> 00:10:18.296
It involves dying to old ways of thinking,

00:10:18.906 --> 00:10:20.646
it involves dying to old habits,

00:10:20.676 --> 00:10:24.956
maybe even to old relationships
that are keeping us from growing.

00:10:25.686 --> 00:10:30.696
Evolving personally involves admitting
that you got some things wrong,

00:10:30.726 --> 00:10:32.746
and letting those things die.

00:10:33.997 --> 00:10:36.347
The second thing that I'm learning

00:10:36.367 --> 00:10:40.507
is that you can't rush
this process of transformation.

00:10:41.047 --> 00:10:43.167
You can't just rush through it.

00:10:43.182 --> 00:10:46.012
I think most of us, when we
realize we got something wrong,

00:10:46.042 --> 00:10:48.532
we just want to get through that
as quick as possible

00:10:48.552 --> 00:10:50.302
and get back to feeling right.

00:10:50.322 --> 00:10:54.472
And the way that a lot of us do that
as individuals, or even as organizations,

00:10:54.492 --> 00:10:55.992
is we just change our behavior,

00:10:56.012 --> 00:10:59.722
and we don't actually acknowledge that
we changed or that we got anything wrong

00:10:59.742 --> 00:11:02.249
and we want everyone
to just kind of pay no attention

00:11:02.259 --> 00:11:04.789
to the man behind
the curtain, or the past.

00:11:05.309 --> 00:11:08.019
In some cases, when we
have to say something about it,

00:11:08.039 --> 00:11:09.872
we just give these lame apologies.

00:11:09.892 --> 00:11:11.132
You know the classic line,

00:11:11.152 --> 00:11:14.082
"If anyone was offended,
I'm sorry to anyone who was offended,

00:11:14.112 --> 00:11:16.512
In other words, it's your fault
for being offended.

00:11:16.532 --> 00:11:18.339
I'm sorry you're offended, right?

00:11:19.483 --> 00:11:21.043
We just want to get past it,

00:11:21.073 --> 00:11:24.663
don't really want to deal with all
the tension and the messiness of it.

00:11:24.683 --> 00:11:27.513
We just want to get back to being right.

00:11:27.543 --> 00:11:30.723
But if you try to rush through that,
you're not going to grow.

00:11:32.380 --> 00:11:35.460
I've been dragging out the process, 
even doing this documentary,

00:11:35.480 --> 00:11:38.930
where I'm sitting down across from people
who have been hurt by my book,

00:11:38.950 --> 00:11:40.615
and it sucks!

00:11:40.995 --> 00:11:42.639
It really does!

00:11:43.540 --> 00:11:46.130
And yet, it's in that tension

00:11:46.150 --> 00:11:48.800
of asking these questions
and facing up to this

00:11:48.820 --> 00:11:50.950
that I'm really growing.

00:11:51.340 --> 00:11:53.481
And it involves asking questions like,

00:11:53.501 --> 00:11:55.471
"What shaped my thinking?"

00:11:56.551 --> 00:11:58.181
"What was behind that?

00:11:58.491 --> 00:12:00.642
How did that express itself?

00:12:01.092 --> 00:12:03.322
How did that affect other people?

00:12:04.462 --> 00:12:06.328
And what do I need to learn

00:12:06.348 --> 00:12:09.798
so that I don't repeat
those same mistakes?"

00:12:09.828 --> 00:12:14.294
Those are hard questions to ask,
that don't come instantly,

00:12:14.674 --> 00:12:16.214
It requires time.

00:12:16.724 --> 00:12:18.504
Think about a caterpillar.

00:12:18.829 --> 00:12:23.189
The caterpillar doesn't just one day,
instantaneously, sprout wings

00:12:23.209 --> 00:12:25.467
and become a butterfly.

00:12:25.497 --> 00:12:30.297
No, a caterpillar literally has
to dissolve before it can transform.

00:12:30.327 --> 00:12:36.229
It forms a cocoon and, within that cocoon,
it becomes a caterpillar smoothie -

00:12:36.239 --> 00:12:38.528
it's not the most scientific explanation -

00:12:39.848 --> 00:12:42.058
before it can be transformed.

00:12:42.668 --> 00:12:46.098
When you are admitting
that you got something wrong,

00:12:46.718 --> 00:12:50.688
there are going to be moments
where you'll feel like you're dissolving.

00:12:51.925 --> 00:12:56.075
You know, you'll feel like you're loosing
your swagger, your confidence -

00:12:56.095 --> 00:12:58.880
You may be losing relationships -

00:12:58.900 --> 00:13:01.350
You may even be lose your sense of self,

00:13:01.370 --> 00:13:04.270
if you're used to base
a lot of your identity in those ideas,

00:13:04.300 --> 00:13:06.660
or that practice, or whatever it might be.

00:13:07.520 --> 00:13:09.580
But something new it's being born,

00:13:09.610 --> 00:13:12.080
so don't rush through it,
don't try to skip it.

00:13:12.877 --> 00:13:14.732
The final thing that I'm learning

00:13:14.742 --> 00:13:18.992
is that admitting that you're wrong
will tick some people off.

00:13:20.262 --> 00:13:24.132
I wish I could say that you'll just get
a bunch of people coming alongside you,

00:13:24.152 --> 00:13:27.772
patting you on the back and saying,
"It's so humble of you to process this."

00:13:27.792 --> 00:13:30.322
But - expect resistance.

00:13:31.052 --> 00:13:32.562
And it makes sense, doesn't it?

00:13:32.582 --> 00:13:37.672
Because there are people in your life 
who were invested in the old you.

00:13:37.702 --> 00:13:42.582
There are people in your life 
who want you to stay the same,

00:13:43.112 --> 00:13:46.542
maybe because they just love you, 
love you the way that you are,

00:13:46.572 --> 00:13:49.922
but also possibly because,
if you admit you're wrong,

00:13:49.942 --> 00:13:51.092
and they agree with you,

00:13:51.112 --> 00:13:54.332
then by implication they are wrong
and don't want to deal with that,

00:13:54.352 --> 00:14:00.182
so they'd rather you stay the way you are
than have to face up to that themselves.

00:14:00.670 --> 00:14:05.660
So, I mean, if you're in one career,
and you decide to switch careers,

00:14:05.690 --> 00:14:08.550
all the people who helped you 
get there and invested in you,

00:14:08.570 --> 00:14:10.790
they are going to take that personally.

00:14:10.810 --> 00:14:12.760
Or if you're part of an organization,

00:14:12.790 --> 00:14:17.930
and you begin to question whether
you're wrong about ideals and values

00:14:17.950 --> 00:14:19.960
that are at the core of that organization,

00:14:19.980 --> 00:14:22.650
that's going to feel like an attack
to that organization.

00:14:22.680 --> 00:14:24.280
They aren't going to like that.

00:14:24.920 --> 00:14:28.950
It's an interesting thought exercise
just the process, you know.

00:14:28.980 --> 00:14:30.992
If I were to change my mind

00:14:31.012 --> 00:14:35.152
and admit that I was wrong
about X, Y, Z - fill in the blank -

00:14:35.762 --> 00:14:37.682
where would I get pushback?

00:14:38.464 --> 00:14:41.814
It could come from family,
come from a religious community,

00:14:41.844 --> 00:14:44.394
come from the business
that you're a part of.

00:14:45.324 --> 00:14:49.674
You know, the hardest part for me,
of re-evaluating my book,

00:14:49.704 --> 00:14:53.594
has been interacting with people
who love my book!

00:14:54.584 --> 00:14:57.874
Because they're so confused, 
and they're so supportive,

00:14:57.894 --> 00:14:59.914
and I'm so grateful for them!

00:15:00.364 --> 00:15:02.444
And yet, as I'm questioning my own book,

00:15:02.464 --> 00:15:05.895
which I feel like I should be
allowed to do, because it's my book -

00:15:05.925 --> 00:15:07.215
(Laughter)

00:15:07.235 --> 00:15:10.725
I can tell that they're like,
"You're not allowed to do that!"

00:15:11.115 --> 00:15:15.175
Because they made decisions based 
on the ideas in my book

00:15:15.205 --> 00:15:17.385
and they feel like
I'm criticizing their life,

00:15:17.415 --> 00:15:18.935
which I'm not!

00:15:18.965 --> 00:15:20.655
I'm not at all doing that.

00:15:20.675 --> 00:15:25.165
And I've really sought to honor them,
and respect them, and hear their stories,

00:15:25.185 --> 00:15:27.055
but at the end of the day I know

00:15:27.085 --> 00:15:30.505
that I can't be controlled
by someone else's viewpoint.

00:15:32.342 --> 00:15:37.072
I think the big idea that I really want
to leave with you is this:

00:15:37.356 --> 00:15:42.416
I think that a lot of us
have been wrong about being wrong.

00:15:43.406 --> 00:15:45.546
We've been so scared of it,

00:15:45.566 --> 00:15:47.696
we've been so afraid of it.

00:15:47.716 --> 00:15:51.126
We've viewed it as weakness.

00:15:51.866 --> 00:15:54.806
We've viewed it as something
that is shameful,

00:15:54.826 --> 00:15:57.896
and so we've shunned people
who've gotten things wrong.

00:15:57.916 --> 00:16:01.866
You know, "Just fired them,
push them aside and find right people!"

00:16:01.886 --> 00:16:05.156
And it's the right people who are
never wrong that we want to follow.

00:16:05.176 --> 00:16:07.076
We want to have leaders.

00:16:08.196 --> 00:16:09.627
But think about it,

00:16:09.998 --> 00:16:12.104
people who are always right,

00:16:12.898 --> 00:16:14.825
they are not really growing!

00:16:15.298 --> 00:16:16.308
They can't change!

00:16:16.328 --> 00:16:19.088
If they're always right
and they change, they'll be wrong,

00:16:19.118 --> 00:16:20.308
You follow me?

00:16:21.236 --> 00:16:24.206
Now, I think we need
to change our thinking

00:16:24.236 --> 00:16:27.556
and to realize that admitting
that you're wrong

00:16:27.576 --> 00:16:29.986
really takes a form of strength.

00:16:30.496 --> 00:16:33.061
And so instead of viewing it
as a dead end,

00:16:33.081 --> 00:16:35.441
we should view it as a new start,

00:16:35.461 --> 00:16:38.753
and instead of shunning people 
who admit they got something wrong,

00:16:38.783 --> 00:16:40.943
we should encourage them

00:16:40.963 --> 00:16:45.343
and invite them to come and share
the wisdom that they're learning.

00:16:45.743 --> 00:16:48.212
You know, the great news -

00:16:48.232 --> 00:16:54.682
The great news about learning
to admit that you got something wrong

00:16:54.702 --> 00:16:57.932
is that you don't have to be
so afraid of being wrong,

00:16:58.622 --> 00:17:04.087
which means you can move toward people
that see the world differently than you

00:17:04.107 --> 00:17:07.107
and not be so terrified
that they might change your mind.

00:17:08.387 --> 00:17:11.192
It means that you can dream,

00:17:11.212 --> 00:17:12.487
and dare,

00:17:12.507 --> 00:17:14.309
and risk,

00:17:14.339 --> 00:17:15.862
and live.

00:17:16.812 --> 00:17:18.252
Thank you so much.

00:17:18.270 --> 00:17:19.810
(Applause)
