00:00:06.996 --> 00:00:10.121
After the California Gold Rush of 1848,

00:00:10.121 --> 00:00:13.204
white settlers streamed west
to strike it rich.

00:00:13.371 --> 00:00:17.288
In addition to precious metals, 
they unearthed another treasure:

00:00:17.954 --> 00:00:19.371
dinosaur bones.

00:00:19.663 --> 00:00:22.413
Two wealthy scientists in particular—

00:00:22.413 --> 00:00:25.621
Othniel Charles Marsh 
and Edward Drinker Cope—

00:00:25.621 --> 00:00:28.871
competed to uncover these
prehistoric monsters.

00:00:29.204 --> 00:00:32.579
Marsh and Cope were first to describe
iconic creatures

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:36.412
like Brontosaurus, Triceratops, 
and Stegosaurus.

00:00:36.746 --> 00:00:42.079
But they also showcased the destructive
whirlwind of profiteering and ambition

00:00:42.079 --> 00:00:45.537
that fueled American science
during the late 1800s.

00:00:45.912 --> 00:00:50.579
Their rivalry, one of the most notorious
scientific feuds in history,

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:53.579
became known as the Bone Wars.

00:00:54.621 --> 00:00:58.787
Marsh was ill-tempered and had 
a knack for debunking falsehoods.

00:00:58.787 --> 00:01:02.954
One woman said that getting to know him
was “like running against a pitchfork.”

00:01:03.037 --> 00:01:07.538
Cope, on the other hand, was charismatic
and given to bold theorizing.

00:01:07.913 --> 00:01:10.788
But he was also sarcastic
and temperamental.

00:01:11.288 --> 00:01:13.204
By his own admission, he wasn’t

00:01:13.204 --> 00:01:17.621
“constructed for getting along comfortably
with the general run of people.”

00:01:17.954 --> 00:01:21.996
When Marsh and Cope first met in 1864,
they were friendly,

00:01:21.996 --> 00:01:25.038
and each named a new species 
in the other’s honor.

00:01:25.579 --> 00:01:27.996
But their relationship soon soured.

00:01:28.371 --> 00:01:33.204
In 1868, Cope took Marsh to a quarry
near his home in New Jersey

00:01:33.204 --> 00:01:36.621
where one of the most complete dinosaur
skeletons to date

00:01:36.621 --> 00:01:38.454
had recently been discovered.

00:01:38.954 --> 00:01:42.288
Sensing an opportunity, 
Marsh paid the mine operators

00:01:42.288 --> 00:01:45.038
to send him the most interesting 
new finds.

00:01:45.496 --> 00:01:48.454
Outraged, Cope accused Marsh of bribery.

00:01:48.829 --> 00:01:53.788
That same year, Cope showed Marsh
his reconstruction of a new marine reptile

00:01:53.788 --> 00:01:55.829
called Elasmosaurus.

00:01:56.371 --> 00:01:59.204
Marsh immediately noticed 
that something was wrong:

00:01:59.496 --> 00:02:03.163
Cope had mistaken the creature’s
long neck for its tail.

00:02:03.746 --> 00:02:07.663
When Cope's mentor sided with Marsh,
Cope was mortified.

00:02:08.079 --> 00:02:13.329
He tried to buy and destroy every copy 
of the article containing his blunder,

00:02:13.329 --> 00:02:14.746
but to no avail.

00:02:15.246 --> 00:02:17.954
Their mutual resentment blossomed.

00:02:18.579 --> 00:02:22.246
After the transcontinental railroad
was completed the following year,

00:02:22.246 --> 00:02:26.204
Cope and Marsh began scouring 
the American West for fossils.

00:02:26.538 --> 00:02:29.788
They found riches the likes 
of which neither had dreamed.

00:02:30.204 --> 00:02:32.996
Relying on the help of Native American 
guides,

00:02:32.996 --> 00:02:36.579
Marsh made some especially
significant discoveries,

00:02:36.579 --> 00:02:39.704
like ancient birds with teeth
that are still celebrated

00:02:39.704 --> 00:02:43.829
as a missing link between dinosaurs
and modern birds.

00:02:44.246 --> 00:02:46.663
Cope made important discoveries, too,

00:02:46.663 --> 00:02:49.788
but Marsh successfully invalidated 
many of them,

00:02:49.788 --> 00:02:53.121
showing them to be redundant 
with other known species.

00:02:53.413 --> 00:02:57.121
Enraged, Cope tried to secure priority 
for new findings

00:02:57.121 --> 00:02:59.288
by announcing them via telegram.

00:02:59.496 --> 00:03:01.913
He even purchased a respected journal

00:03:01.913 --> 00:03:04.663
so future publications could
be rushed into print.

00:03:04.954 --> 00:03:09.163
But Marsh used his personal fortune
to gain the upper hand,

00:03:09.163 --> 00:03:13.538
hiring a small army of fossil hunters
to out-compete his rival.

00:03:13.996 --> 00:03:19.788
In 1878, Marsh bought an especially
promising quarry in Como Bluff, Wyoming,

00:03:19.829 --> 00:03:21.621
from two frontier collectors.

00:03:21.829 --> 00:03:24.413
It yielded tons of fossils,

00:03:24.413 --> 00:03:28.329
including the near-complete skeleton 
of a gigantic dinosaur

00:03:28.329 --> 00:03:31.079
that Marsh named Brontosaurus.

00:03:31.454 --> 00:03:36.288
Over the next 10 years, his men shipped 
him more than 480 boxes

00:03:36.288 --> 00:03:39.288
of dinosaur bones from Como alone.

00:03:39.621 --> 00:03:42.663
Marsh named dozens of new species.

00:03:42.663 --> 00:03:45.454
But his assistants could be ruthless 
in their quest

00:03:45.454 --> 00:03:47.871
to further Marsh’s scientific ambitions.

00:03:48.038 --> 00:03:51.246
They sometimes destroyed fossils 
just to prevent them

00:03:51.246 --> 00:03:53.538
from falling into Cope’s hands.

00:03:53.871 --> 00:03:55.913
Desperate to catch up with Marsh,

00:03:55.913 --> 00:03:59.788
Cope invested his dwindling fortune
into silver mining.

00:04:00.246 --> 00:04:03.704
The gamble failed, 
and he was left nearly destitute.

00:04:04.121 --> 00:04:07.121
While Cope contemplated selling 
his precious collection,

00:04:07.121 --> 00:04:11.538
Marsh was named lead paleontologist 
for the US Geological Survey.

00:04:11.913 --> 00:04:16.704
This well-funded branch of the government 
often sponsored Westward expeditions,

00:04:16.704 --> 00:04:20.579
giving Marsh even more resources
to vanquish his rival.

00:04:21.288 --> 00:04:25.829
The Bone Wars spilled into public view 
when Cope had a tabloid newspaper

00:04:25.829 --> 00:04:31.413
publish an article accusing Marsh 
of plagiarism, fraud, and corruption.

00:04:31.829 --> 00:04:36.204
Marsh fired back and the two further 
tarnished each other’s reputations.

00:04:36.496 --> 00:04:38.621
Neither ever relented.

00:04:39.246 --> 00:04:42.704
When Cope died, he donated
his skull to science,

00:04:42.704 --> 00:04:46.413
hoping to prove that his brain was
larger than that of his enemy.

00:04:46.871 --> 00:04:49.746
Marsh never accepted the challenge.

00:04:50.204 --> 00:04:53.246
Although Marsh named more species 
than Cope,

00:04:53.413 --> 00:04:57.413
both men greatly expanded 
our understanding of evolution.

00:04:57.829 --> 00:05:01.496
But their egotistical one-upmanship
reminds us that,

00:05:01.496 --> 00:05:03.204
in spite of its ideals,

00:05:03.204 --> 00:05:07.996
science is a personal enterprise
conducted by individual—

00:05:07.996 --> 00:05:11.579
and at times deeply flawed— 
human beings.
