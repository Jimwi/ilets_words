00:00:00.958 --> 00:00:03.625
(ambient music)

00:00:11.387 --> 00:00:12.970
- Welcome everybody

00:00:13.916 --> 00:00:16.030
to this second of two events

00:00:16.030 --> 00:00:18.887
around the visit of this
year's Una's Lecturer,

00:00:18.887 --> 00:00:20.257
Ben Ratliff.

00:00:20.257 --> 00:00:21.476
I'm Tim Hampton,

00:00:21.476 --> 00:00:22.834
the director of the
Townsend Humanities Center.

00:00:22.834 --> 00:00:24.947
And I'm really happy that
everyone could show up

00:00:24.947 --> 00:00:26.735
for today's event.

00:00:26.735 --> 00:00:30.152
Just to say a few words about Ben's work.

00:00:31.031 --> 00:00:33.237
It seems to me that one of
the most striking changes

00:00:33.237 --> 00:00:35.837
that has come to pass over
our collective cultural life

00:00:35.837 --> 00:00:38.206
in the past two decades
is a transformation

00:00:38.206 --> 00:00:39.924
in the role of the critic.

00:00:39.924 --> 00:00:42.455
With the rise of new technologies
that have both altered

00:00:42.455 --> 00:00:44.197
the way we read and the way we experience

00:00:44.197 --> 00:00:47.793
our sonic landscape, the
traditional function of the art,

00:00:47.793 --> 00:00:50.396
theater or music critic has shifted.

00:00:50.396 --> 00:00:52.556
The conventional function
of the New York Times

00:00:52.556 --> 00:00:54.946
or San Francisco Chronicle reviewer,

00:00:54.946 --> 00:00:56.689
who makes judgments about the quality

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:58.361
of this or that aesthetic artifact

00:00:58.361 --> 00:01:00.822
has given way to a much more
challenging and important role

00:01:00.822 --> 00:01:04.119
as a kind of guide for the perplexed,

00:01:04.119 --> 00:01:06.162
an informed and thoughtful
voice that can help

00:01:06.162 --> 00:01:08.067
listeners and readers make sense

00:01:08.067 --> 00:01:10.249
of the increasingly complicated landscape

00:01:10.249 --> 00:01:11.407
in which we live.

00:01:11.407 --> 00:01:13.105
Or, to put it slightly differently,

00:01:13.105 --> 00:01:14.568
the critic as tastemaker has given way

00:01:14.568 --> 00:01:17.215
to the critic as mapmaker.

00:01:17.215 --> 00:01:20.187
As we are confronted with an
overload of image and sound,

00:01:20.187 --> 00:01:21.999
with access to every song ever,

00:01:21.999 --> 00:01:24.181
the critic takes on
the role of interpreter

00:01:24.181 --> 00:01:25.900
and critical voice,

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:28.150
able to describe new trends
and repackage old trends.

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:30.845
And the repackaging of old trends,

00:01:30.845 --> 00:01:34.096
with the ability to cut through bullshit

00:01:34.096 --> 00:01:37.208
and isolate important issues
in our cultural moment.

00:01:37.208 --> 00:01:39.205
And no one has embraced the
complexity and difficult

00:01:39.205 --> 00:01:40.876
of writing about culture
in the current moment

00:01:40.876 --> 00:01:44.243
than our guest today,
Una's Lecturer Ben Ratliff.

00:01:44.243 --> 00:01:45.846
As pop and jazz critic
for the New York Times

00:01:45.846 --> 00:01:49.305
over two decades, and as
the author of five books,

00:01:49.305 --> 00:01:50.904
culminating most recently
in the dazzling study

00:01:50.904 --> 00:01:52.138
Every Song Ever,

00:01:52.138 --> 00:01:54.363
20 Ways to Listen in an
Age of Musical Plenty,

00:01:54.363 --> 00:01:57.288
Ratliff has charted with
a sure hand and style

00:01:57.288 --> 00:01:59.011
the explosion of sonic information

00:01:59.011 --> 00:02:00.892
that now defines our moment.

00:02:00.892 --> 00:02:02.866
More than anyone, it seems to me,

00:02:02.866 --> 00:02:05.048
he has grasped the
changing role of the critic

00:02:05.048 --> 00:02:06.929
and the changing nature of music.

00:02:06.929 --> 00:02:09.089
As boundaries between
note and noise evaporate,

00:02:09.089 --> 00:02:12.036
as live performance is
haunted by digitization

00:02:12.036 --> 00:02:14.054
and vice versa.

00:02:14.054 --> 00:02:16.264
Whether he is writing about the textures

00:02:16.264 --> 00:02:18.052
of John Coltrane's late
style in his remarkable book

00:02:18.052 --> 00:02:19.744
On The Sound of Coltrane,

00:02:19.744 --> 00:02:22.928
or studying the ability of a DJ scratch

00:02:22.928 --> 00:02:24.832
to create density in a recording,

00:02:24.832 --> 00:02:27.061
or zeroing in on a single strummed chord

00:02:27.061 --> 00:02:28.638
by country singer Merle Haggard,

00:02:28.638 --> 00:02:30.264
Ratliff has mapped out the emotional

00:02:30.264 --> 00:02:32.611
and even physical stakes
of the waves of vibration

00:02:32.611 --> 00:02:35.165
that shape our soundscape.

00:02:35.165 --> 00:02:37.696
So please join me in
welcoming Ben Ratliff.

00:02:37.696 --> 00:02:40.863
(audience applauding)

00:02:44.429 --> 00:02:46.194
- Thank you.

00:02:46.194 --> 00:02:49.361
I'm gonna begin by playing you a song.

00:02:52.482 --> 00:02:55.815
(Flamenco song playing)

00:06:23.046 --> 00:06:25.888
That is Siempre Estoy Yolando,

00:06:25.888 --> 00:06:29.069
the song I have most recently discovered,

00:06:29.069 --> 00:06:31.879
which involuntarily suggests for me

00:06:31.879 --> 00:06:34.685
the word we are about to discuss.

00:06:34.685 --> 00:06:36.593
The singer is La Nina de la Puebla,

00:06:36.593 --> 00:06:39.841
whose background has been
described by Flamenco historians

00:06:39.841 --> 00:06:40.924
as non-gypsy.

00:06:42.700 --> 00:06:45.811
And the guitarist was Sabicas.

00:06:45.811 --> 00:06:48.319
And this recording was
made in the early 1930s

00:06:48.319 --> 00:06:49.689
in Sevilla.

00:06:49.689 --> 00:06:52.777
Nina de la Puebla was
blind and a traveling star

00:06:52.777 --> 00:06:55.749
by her mid twenties, that's her.

00:06:55.749 --> 00:06:58.536
She admired the unremitting intensity

00:06:58.536 --> 00:07:01.763
of cante jondo style Flamenco singing.

00:07:01.763 --> 00:07:04.457
But her voice wasn't quite suited to it,

00:07:04.457 --> 00:07:08.098
instead it was thin and fine and capable

00:07:08.098 --> 00:07:11.794
of flickering microtonal precision.

00:07:11.794 --> 00:07:14.673
She allows you to register
all the articulation

00:07:14.673 --> 00:07:16.810
as it is happening,

00:07:16.810 --> 00:07:19.875
and that is a quality
is suppose I associate

00:07:19.875 --> 00:07:21.208
with virtuosity.

00:07:22.545 --> 00:07:26.655
This is a recording in which
her voice is on display,

00:07:26.655 --> 00:07:31.157
but it's also moving through a
relationship with the guitar.

00:07:31.157 --> 00:07:33.226
And they are saying ole to each other

00:07:33.226 --> 00:07:37.081
and to the atmosphere they
are creating together.

00:07:37.081 --> 00:07:39.681
Much later, in the early 80s,

00:07:39.681 --> 00:07:42.375
Sabicas was asked whether a non-Spaniard

00:07:42.375 --> 00:07:44.958
can hope to play Flamenco well.

00:07:45.997 --> 00:07:50.339
He had a very all-or-nothing
Flamenco answer.

00:07:50.339 --> 00:07:52.592
"Of course," he said,

00:07:52.592 --> 00:07:56.307
"but Flamenco is 100% atmosphere,

00:07:56.307 --> 00:07:59.575
"and if you are alone
without the atmosphere,

00:07:59.575 --> 00:08:01.322
"you won't get anywhere.

00:08:01.322 --> 00:08:03.528
"You must mix every day with people

00:08:03.528 --> 00:08:05.943
"who sing, dance or play.

00:08:05.943 --> 00:08:07.290
"And if you don't do that,

00:08:07.290 --> 00:08:08.637
"you'll have a lot of technique,

00:08:08.637 --> 00:08:11.554
"but you won't know how to use it."

00:08:12.491 --> 00:08:14.180
Technique is an interpretive translation

00:08:14.180 --> 00:08:16.067
of what Sabicas really said.

00:08:16.067 --> 00:08:19.900
He really said muchos
dedos, a lot of fingers.

00:08:22.174 --> 00:08:24.757
When I hear Nina de los Peines,

00:08:26.330 --> 00:08:29.511
who was gitana, and much
more widely thought-of

00:08:29.511 --> 00:08:32.832
as the greatest female singer of Flamenco,

00:08:32.832 --> 00:08:35.525
I hear more of everything.

00:08:35.525 --> 00:08:39.589
More emotional engagement,
and her voice is bigger,

00:08:39.589 --> 00:08:43.756
and broader, and often on the
verge of a shout, or in one.

00:08:47.460 --> 00:08:48.293
Like this.

00:08:51.106 --> 00:08:54.439
(Flamenco song playing)

00:09:19.899 --> 00:09:22.633
Her art is beyond my understanding.

00:09:22.633 --> 00:09:26.447
I wonder why, with Nina de los Peines,

00:09:26.447 --> 00:09:29.721
who we just heard, I love
the sound and the voice,

00:09:29.721 --> 00:09:31.643
I will listen to it forever,

00:09:31.643 --> 00:09:35.560
but the V word never
comes to mind as a marker.

00:09:38.055 --> 00:09:40.565
It's transforming to
see a musician be great

00:09:40.565 --> 00:09:43.769
within the range of
what great means to you.

00:09:43.769 --> 00:09:48.529
And it's moving to see a
musician even try to be great.

00:09:48.529 --> 00:09:52.427
I don't have anything
against muchos dedos,

00:09:52.427 --> 00:09:57.097
techno, or techno-spiritual
excellence in music.

00:09:57.097 --> 00:10:00.415
I have learned how to
respond, I think ole,

00:10:00.415 --> 00:10:03.436
and then I move quickly past the event

00:10:03.436 --> 00:10:06.872
or the achievement in
search of what I think of

00:10:06.872 --> 00:10:09.772
as the real door within their sound,

00:10:09.772 --> 00:10:12.770
which when opened will
tell me who they are

00:10:12.770 --> 00:10:15.270
and what they're trying to do.

00:10:16.486 --> 00:10:18.784
But I have questions about some ideas

00:10:18.784 --> 00:10:20.874
connected to the word virtuosity,

00:10:20.874 --> 00:10:23.986
and I would like to take
this time to ask them.

00:10:23.986 --> 00:10:27.348
I sense that this
movable and slippery word

00:10:27.348 --> 00:10:30.789
has grown more so through
the reception of music,

00:10:30.789 --> 00:10:34.876
particularly music in the
European classical tradition,

00:10:34.876 --> 00:10:36.914
rather than through the doing of it.

00:10:36.914 --> 00:10:39.682
In other words, as a value,

00:10:39.682 --> 00:10:42.910
I think virtuosity is
more a beholder's value.

00:10:42.910 --> 00:10:45.244
And so I'm gonna interrupt this talk

00:10:45.244 --> 00:10:48.413
with words from other beholders,

00:10:48.413 --> 00:10:49.969
musicians and writers and friends

00:10:49.969 --> 00:10:52.523
to whom I all posed the same question:

00:10:52.523 --> 00:10:54.706
when you think about virtuosity,

00:10:54.706 --> 00:10:57.123
what or whom do you think of?

00:10:59.466 --> 00:11:03.111
And at the end of these
quotes from other people,

00:11:03.111 --> 00:11:05.758
I will point back to myself, like this,

00:11:05.758 --> 00:11:08.498
so you know it's me again.

00:11:08.498 --> 00:11:11.581
Teju Cole, a writer in New York City.

00:11:12.910 --> 00:11:15.836
"When I watch masterclasses,
what strikes me

00:11:15.836 --> 00:11:18.367
"is that the master in
question takes the matter

00:11:18.367 --> 00:11:21.939
"of technical ability for granted.

00:11:21.939 --> 00:11:23.980
"Of course you can hit all the notes,

00:11:23.980 --> 00:11:27.072
"else why would you even
be in a masterclass.

00:11:27.072 --> 00:11:30.093
"And more often than not,
what the master then teaches

00:11:30.093 --> 00:11:32.160
"is where to place the accents,

00:11:32.160 --> 00:11:34.505
"how to vary within repetitions,

00:11:34.505 --> 00:11:37.240
"how to create little narratives.

00:11:37.240 --> 00:11:39.799
"True virtuosity lies in an accumulation

00:11:39.799 --> 00:11:41.882
"of those little touches.

00:11:42.771 --> 00:11:44.443
"And of course the superlative virtuosos

00:11:44.443 --> 00:11:47.740
"are all interpretation,
and they drop lots of notes

00:11:47.740 --> 00:11:48.990
"along the way.

00:11:49.923 --> 00:11:53.893
"I think of Horowitz,
Rubinstein, even Richter.

00:11:53.893 --> 00:11:55.663
"But perhaps few artists have shown

00:11:55.663 --> 00:11:58.301
"how far interpretation
can surpass technique

00:11:58.301 --> 00:12:01.051
"as well as Thelonious Monk has."

00:12:03.273 --> 00:12:05.014
When you are really young,

00:12:05.014 --> 00:12:08.358
a song does something
practical, it has a function.

00:12:08.358 --> 00:12:11.790
It keeps you company when
you sing it to yourself,

00:12:11.790 --> 00:12:15.812
or it marks off a countdown,
or it narrates a game.

00:12:15.812 --> 00:12:19.271
Or it accompanies the
characters and visual effects

00:12:19.271 --> 00:12:23.474
in a movie, or it's
something sung at gatherings,

00:12:23.474 --> 00:12:25.007
like hymns or anthems.

00:12:25.007 --> 00:12:26.725
Or it's what you play on an instrument,

00:12:26.725 --> 00:12:29.740
for reasons that may be obscure to you,

00:12:29.740 --> 00:12:33.528
every Thursday at 4:30, with a teacher,

00:12:33.528 --> 00:12:36.031
sitting on gray metal folding chairs

00:12:36.031 --> 00:12:38.405
in a basement classroom.

00:12:38.405 --> 00:12:41.400
And then one day you
hear something special,

00:12:41.400 --> 00:12:43.118
usually a recording,

00:12:43.118 --> 00:12:45.092
and you feel an integrated response

00:12:45.092 --> 00:12:50.061
in parts of your body that
you do not have names for.

00:12:50.061 --> 00:12:52.406
And you cannot believe
that someone made music

00:12:52.406 --> 00:12:55.820
as fluid and purposeful as that,

00:12:55.820 --> 00:12:58.490
in which fast melodic steps,

00:12:58.490 --> 00:13:01.764
or changes of atmosphere through tone,

00:13:01.764 --> 00:13:03.347
come down like law.

00:13:04.759 --> 00:13:07.639
These musicians are not
only better than you,

00:13:07.639 --> 00:13:11.632
but so much better than they need to be,

00:13:11.632 --> 00:13:13.444
and they're bringing back
evidence from an atmosphere

00:13:13.444 --> 00:13:15.611
you do not have access to.

00:13:17.391 --> 00:13:20.386
And sometimes they're
doing it nonchalantly,

00:13:20.386 --> 00:13:24.380
or seeming as if an outside
force is guiding them.

00:13:24.380 --> 00:13:26.888
They can do this from
their learned instincts

00:13:26.888 --> 00:13:29.787
of technique and show business,

00:13:29.787 --> 00:13:32.275
but at best it probably
comes from their knowledge

00:13:32.275 --> 00:13:35.358
that virtuosity is a means to an end.

00:13:36.431 --> 00:13:38.821
There is something beyond virtuosity,

00:13:38.821 --> 00:13:40.843
and that is the part that you don't,

00:13:40.843 --> 00:13:43.510
or are unwilling to, understand.

00:13:46.114 --> 00:13:48.459
To some extent the listener
recognizing all this

00:13:48.459 --> 00:13:51.709
has to be naive, at least for a moment.

00:13:53.010 --> 00:13:55.472
To respond to music at that high level,

00:13:55.472 --> 00:13:58.389
whether or however you evaluate it,

00:13:59.651 --> 00:14:02.345
is to take part in a kind of fantasy.

00:14:02.345 --> 00:14:04.133
But does that mean a fantasy in which

00:14:04.133 --> 00:14:08.034
everyone in the world
is musically virtuosic?

00:14:08.034 --> 00:14:10.623
Or does it mean a fantasy in which

00:14:10.623 --> 00:14:13.166
there is no such thing as virtuosity,

00:14:13.166 --> 00:14:16.230
because there is no such
thing as a musician?

00:14:16.230 --> 00:14:19.963
Because a musician is a
just another breather,

00:14:19.963 --> 00:14:23.428
and all of our movements,
all of our thoughts,

00:14:23.428 --> 00:14:25.449
all of our speech, comes
out in this fantasy

00:14:25.449 --> 00:14:28.695
as graceful and purposeful art.

00:14:28.695 --> 00:14:31.924
Anyway, the first virtuosic performance

00:14:31.924 --> 00:14:35.712
we really notice might be
the most satisfying one

00:14:35.712 --> 00:14:38.011
we ever hear in our lives.

00:14:38.011 --> 00:14:41.841
It might be Vision of
Love by Mariah Carey,

00:14:41.841 --> 00:14:44.234
or Come On by Jimi Hendrix,

00:14:44.234 --> 00:14:46.602
or Aaron Rosand playing Saint-Saens's

00:14:46.602 --> 00:14:48.924
Third Violin Concerto,

00:14:48.924 --> 00:14:51.757
or John Coltrane playing Giant Steps,

00:14:51.757 --> 00:14:55.924
or Andre 3000 rapping in
Outkast's Return of the G.

00:14:56.818 --> 00:14:58.467
And often around that time,

00:14:58.467 --> 00:15:00.832
when listeners have that experience,

00:15:00.832 --> 00:15:03.251
their parents cease to
be as interesting to them

00:15:03.251 --> 00:15:04.751
as they once were.

00:15:10.983 --> 00:15:15.150
("I Had A Vision of Love" by Mariah Carey)

00:15:41.744 --> 00:15:45.411
("Come On" by Jimi Hendrix)

00:16:03.205 --> 00:16:07.372
(Saint-Saens's Third Violin
Concerto by Aaron Rosand)

00:16:29.834 --> 00:16:33.917
("Giant Steps" by John Coltrane)

00:16:44.792 --> 00:16:48.709
("Return of the G" by Outkast)

00:17:01.464 --> 00:17:05.202
Kwame Coleman, a jazz
pianist and musicologist,

00:17:05.202 --> 00:17:07.710
and professor in New York:

00:17:07.710 --> 00:17:09.939
"I've come to understand
virtuosity as a musician

00:17:09.939 --> 00:17:12.911
"exercising a certain
virtue in how they work out

00:17:12.911 --> 00:17:15.697
"and execute their music.

00:17:15.697 --> 00:17:18.669
"The most obvious example is
John Coltrane's reputation

00:17:18.669 --> 00:17:22.570
"for his disciplined,
compulsive and `prodigious`

00:17:22.570 --> 00:17:25.704
"practice habits, a
dedication to self-mastery

00:17:25.704 --> 00:17:29.345
"in the service of
creating a music poetry,

00:17:29.345 --> 00:17:32.262
"with deeply spiritual undertones."

00:17:34.366 --> 00:17:38.405
Leron Thomas, a jazz and
other things trumpet player

00:17:38.405 --> 00:17:39.822
in New York City:

00:17:41.146 --> 00:17:45.313
"To call Coltrane a virtuoso
would be to reduce him."

00:17:47.764 --> 00:17:50.643
"Virtuosity is about shifting borders,"

00:17:50.643 --> 00:17:53.102
Dana Gooley has written in his great book,

00:17:53.102 --> 00:17:54.685
The Virtuoso Liszt.

00:17:55.984 --> 00:17:58.886
"The musician, the
athlete and the magician

00:17:58.886 --> 00:18:02.695
"are potentially virtuosos as
soon as they cross a limit,

00:18:02.695 --> 00:18:05.478
"the limit of what seems possible

00:18:05.478 --> 00:18:08.078
"or what the spectator can imagine.

00:18:08.078 --> 00:18:10.818
"Once this act of
transgression is complete,

00:18:10.818 --> 00:18:13.466
"the border shifts, and the
boundaries of the possible

00:18:13.466 --> 00:18:14.549
"are redrawn.

00:18:15.555 --> 00:18:18.040
"If the performer does not cross a newer,

00:18:18.040 --> 00:18:19.781
"more challenging one,

00:18:19.781 --> 00:18:24.495
"he will no longer be
perceived as a virtuoso."

00:18:24.495 --> 00:18:26.608
That's Dana Gooley.

00:18:26.608 --> 00:18:28.048
But at a certain point,

00:18:28.048 --> 00:18:30.602
the listener can grow up and decide

00:18:30.602 --> 00:18:33.272
that many virtuosos are alike.

00:18:33.272 --> 00:18:35.942
Or to be more precise, it's
not the musicians themselves

00:18:35.942 --> 00:18:39.170
who are alike, it's the
borders that they represent.

00:18:39.170 --> 00:18:42.351
Because, to a certain way of thinking,

00:18:42.351 --> 00:18:46.518
Franz Liszt, playing an
unaccompanied recital in 1840,

00:18:48.966 --> 00:18:52.633
that's a `caricature` of
him made at the time,

00:18:54.727 --> 00:18:58.894
was Jerry Lee Lewis in front
of a pick-up band in 1964,

00:19:01.856 --> 00:19:04.782
who was James P. Johnson
playing solo piano

00:19:04.782 --> 00:19:08.032
at a basement casino in Harlem in 1913.

00:19:10.935 --> 00:19:14.935
Liszt and Lewis both had
long, romanticist hair.

00:19:17.506 --> 00:19:20.594
Liszt and Johnson both
deployed powerful rituals

00:19:20.594 --> 00:19:22.243
of stagecraft.

00:19:22.243 --> 00:19:23.985
Just before sitting down to play,

00:19:23.985 --> 00:19:27.375
Liszt threw his gloves and
handkerchief on the floor.

00:19:27.375 --> 00:19:29.715
Johnson shook a silk handkerchief

00:19:29.715 --> 00:19:32.460
and dusted off the piano stool with it.

00:19:32.460 --> 00:19:34.410
All three played piano in a way

00:19:34.410 --> 00:19:35.780
sometimes called orchestral,

00:19:35.780 --> 00:19:38.242
with double glissandi
and almost frightening

00:19:38.242 --> 00:19:41.957
dynamic shifts, and projected
a kind of domination

00:19:41.957 --> 00:19:43.874
over their instruments.

00:19:44.949 --> 00:19:47.598
Johnson said that he used to perform

00:19:47.598 --> 00:19:50.455
Liszt's Rigoletto Concert Paraphrase

00:19:50.455 --> 00:19:52.955
as an introduction to a stomp.

00:19:53.822 --> 00:19:55.166
Hans Christian Anderson,

00:19:55.166 --> 00:19:57.909
having seen Liszt perform in Weimar,

00:19:57.909 --> 00:19:59.163
wrote this about him:

00:19:59.163 --> 00:20:02.088
"He seemed to me a demon
who was nailed fast

00:20:02.088 --> 00:20:06.255
"to the instrument whence
the tones streamed forth."

00:20:09.542 --> 00:20:11.423
Jerry Lee Lewis told his
first record producer

00:20:11.423 --> 00:20:14.302
that he thought the devil was inside him.

00:20:14.302 --> 00:20:16.543
All of them pumped their
forearms at the piano,

00:20:16.543 --> 00:20:20.455
as opposed to keeping their
hands low by the keys.

00:20:20.455 --> 00:20:23.451
It has been suggested that
Liszt raised up off the bench

00:20:23.451 --> 00:20:27.201
while playing his famously
fast `encore` piece,

00:20:28.484 --> 00:20:29.984
Galop Chromatique.

00:20:31.137 --> 00:20:33.412
Jerry Lee Lewis ritually
did the same thing,

00:20:33.412 --> 00:20:35.682
and kicked his stool away.

00:20:35.682 --> 00:20:37.567
His stool is out of the picture,

00:20:37.567 --> 00:20:40.212
but I have seen a larger
version of this picture

00:20:40.212 --> 00:20:43.718
in which you see the stool
and it's upside-down.

00:20:43.718 --> 00:20:45.324
Also, do you notice,

00:20:45.324 --> 00:20:49.174
this is the moment he
is really turning it on,

00:20:49.174 --> 00:20:52.591
but his face is just like a mask of calm.

00:20:56.771 --> 00:20:58.745
I doubt that Jerry Lee Lewis is a virtuoso

00:20:58.745 --> 00:21:01.899
in terms of harmonic fluency
or range of expression,

00:21:01.899 --> 00:21:03.946
he's no James P. Johnson.

00:21:03.946 --> 00:21:07.104
But he is fluid and purposeful,

00:21:07.104 --> 00:21:10.121
and in control of his
own musical language.

00:21:10.121 --> 00:21:11.818
And to see him play his music

00:21:11.818 --> 00:21:13.745
is to feel implicated by it.

00:21:13.745 --> 00:21:15.719
And so what makes them all remarkable

00:21:15.719 --> 00:21:19.059
turns out to be what makes them similar.

00:21:19.059 --> 00:21:21.809
Until you see, let's say, Prince.

00:21:23.103 --> 00:21:26.697
Because Prince redrew the
boundaries of the possible.

00:21:26.697 --> 00:21:28.490
I remember seeing him
in Madison Square Garden

00:21:28.490 --> 00:21:31.439
about 20 years ago, and
being under the impression

00:21:31.439 --> 00:21:34.132
that he could control the lights

00:21:34.132 --> 00:21:37.755
with cueing motions from his hands.

00:21:37.755 --> 00:21:39.752
He probably was doing that,

00:21:39.752 --> 00:21:41.793
and if that were all he were doing,

00:21:41.793 --> 00:21:44.230
I might not have been quite so impressed.

00:21:44.230 --> 00:21:48.691
But he was also playing a
highly articulated guitar solo,

00:21:48.691 --> 00:21:51.191
and I think spinning in place.

00:21:52.517 --> 00:21:55.123
More than that, he
merged with his actions.

00:21:55.123 --> 00:21:59.274
He was the guitar, he was the
spin, and he was the lights.

00:21:59.274 --> 00:22:03.970
So here is another aspect
of virtuosity, perhaps,

00:22:03.970 --> 00:22:08.137
doing and being more than
one thing very well at once.

00:22:10.309 --> 00:22:13.976
Parul Sehgal, a literary
critic in Brooklyn:

00:22:14.860 --> 00:22:18.018
"Virtuosity for me implies
a kind of abundance,

00:22:18.018 --> 00:22:22.185
"a kind of mastery so great
that the activity becomes play."

00:22:24.589 --> 00:22:26.191
James P. Johnson used to play a piece

00:22:26.191 --> 00:22:28.630
called Imitator's Rag,

00:22:28.630 --> 00:22:30.975
whose final strain had
Dixie in the right hand

00:22:30.975 --> 00:22:34.992
and the Star Spangled Banner in the left.

00:22:34.992 --> 00:22:35.988
And so on.

00:22:35.988 --> 00:22:38.238
This kind of virtuosity is
not necessarily about returns

00:22:38.238 --> 00:22:40.123
but about generosity,

00:22:40.123 --> 00:22:42.678
the musician adds an
extra level to their work

00:22:42.678 --> 00:22:45.510
just to do it, just for the feeling,

00:22:45.510 --> 00:22:49.677
or to specify the exact
crossing of discipline and love.

00:22:51.339 --> 00:22:52.755
And this is the right
time to say that parents

00:22:52.755 --> 00:22:56.842
are often the first
virtuosos in your life.

00:22:56.842 --> 00:22:59.675
They pick you up with a left arm,

00:22:59.675 --> 00:23:03.342
they feed you with
right, and walk with you,

00:23:04.412 --> 00:23:07.964
sometimes while talking to someone else.

00:23:07.964 --> 00:23:11.029
They are Prince, they
know they can do this

00:23:11.029 --> 00:23:12.910
any day of the week.

00:23:12.910 --> 00:23:14.907
You're in awe of this for some years,

00:23:14.907 --> 00:23:16.834
and then someone with
a guitar or microphone

00:23:16.834 --> 00:23:19.342
surpasses them, as far
as you're concerned,

00:23:19.342 --> 00:23:21.592
and the border has shifted.

00:23:30.533 --> 00:23:33.599
The V word appeared in my
inbox as I was writing this

00:23:33.599 --> 00:23:36.849
in a message sent by a music publicist.

00:23:37.685 --> 00:23:40.379
"I hope you're doing well," it reads,

00:23:40.379 --> 00:23:43.093
"I'm checking in about
the virtuosic saxophonist

00:23:43.093 --> 00:23:47.260
"slash composer slash arranger
X's sophomore release."

00:23:49.296 --> 00:23:51.571
Reading sentences like
this has been part of

00:23:51.571 --> 00:23:55.008
my everyday life for about 25 years.

00:23:55.008 --> 00:23:59.175
Sophomore release is the
perfumed data of music biz talk,

00:24:00.650 --> 00:24:03.692
and virtuosic is, or purports to be,

00:24:03.692 --> 00:24:06.692
the language of a rare aestheticism.

00:24:07.732 --> 00:24:10.263
The publicist may or may not know

00:24:10.263 --> 00:24:12.858
that the rise of the
word in the first half

00:24:12.858 --> 00:24:15.672
of the 19th century, the
time of Liszt and Paganini

00:24:15.672 --> 00:24:18.530
and Schumann was coterminous with the rise

00:24:18.530 --> 00:24:22.013
of the popular music
critic, a person like me.

00:24:22.013 --> 00:24:26.471
And the rise of the touring
superstar solo recitalist.

00:24:26.471 --> 00:24:27.469
But that doesn't matter.

00:24:27.469 --> 00:24:31.881
The publicist knows that
V is a word with muscles.

00:24:31.881 --> 00:24:34.830
The publicist is strutting just a bit,

00:24:34.830 --> 00:24:37.984
and so a music critic's response to V,

00:24:37.984 --> 00:24:40.960
in whatever direction, is Pavlovian,

00:24:40.960 --> 00:24:43.605
or at least irrational.

00:24:43.605 --> 00:24:46.045
Attraction or repulsion.

00:24:46.045 --> 00:24:48.855
I'll be into it, or I'll
be skeptical around.

00:24:48.855 --> 00:24:50.811
Most likely I'll be skeptical around it.

00:24:50.811 --> 00:24:53.952
Because V, to me, in and of itself,

00:24:53.952 --> 00:24:56.331
without the instinct that comes before it,

00:24:56.331 --> 00:24:59.118
or the grace that comes after it,

00:24:59.118 --> 00:25:01.285
means shutting down doubt.

00:25:02.926 --> 00:25:04.784
It's the projection of a system of power

00:25:04.784 --> 00:25:06.524
that I don't wanna be part of,

00:25:06.524 --> 00:25:08.941
and it is my job to question.

00:25:11.471 --> 00:25:15.638
Geeta Dayal, a writer and
music critic in Los Angeles:

00:25:16.812 --> 00:25:19.270
"To me the word virtuosity
is biased toward melody.

00:25:19.270 --> 00:25:20.915
"Whether you think of a virtuoso pianist,

00:25:20.915 --> 00:25:24.165
"or a particularly ripping guitar solo.

00:25:26.584 --> 00:25:28.692
"And while there are certainly drummers

00:25:28.692 --> 00:25:31.156
"who are considered virtuosos,

00:25:31.156 --> 00:25:33.573
"the concept of virtuosity
is biased against

00:25:33.573 --> 00:25:35.156
"rhythm and timbre.

00:25:36.755 --> 00:25:39.355
"The big innovation in
the 21st century for me

00:25:39.355 --> 00:25:43.948
"is timbre, the invention
of new timbres and textures.

00:25:43.948 --> 00:25:48.272
"Timbre is threatening to the
establishment in some way,

00:25:48.272 --> 00:25:50.826
"because it's not easily quantifiable,

00:25:50.826 --> 00:25:53.076
"nor is it easily notated."

00:25:56.933 --> 00:26:00.160
I admit that I noticed
the word in the email.

00:26:00.160 --> 00:26:03.040
It means something to me that
someone will go on the record

00:26:03.040 --> 00:26:05.585
calling a musician a virtuoso.

00:26:05.585 --> 00:26:08.742
But beyond that I have no
more interest in musician X,

00:26:08.742 --> 00:26:13.172
whose work I don't think
I knew, than I did before.

00:26:13.172 --> 00:26:15.755
I may have less interest.

00:26:15.755 --> 00:26:19.214
From my perspective, here's
what the situation looks like.

00:26:19.214 --> 00:26:22.512
The publicist in general
is paid to consider

00:26:22.512 --> 00:26:25.484
using the word as a term of praise,

00:26:25.484 --> 00:26:27.992
to consider using the
word as a term of praise.

00:26:27.992 --> 00:26:31.892
The critic in general is paid to consider

00:26:31.892 --> 00:26:35.770
using the word as a term of disapproval.

00:26:35.770 --> 00:26:37.767
And the musician is esteemed,

00:26:37.767 --> 00:26:39.625
if not necessarily paid,

00:26:39.625 --> 00:26:43.015
for being disinterested in the concept,

00:26:43.015 --> 00:26:44.640
for wanting to get free of it,

00:26:44.640 --> 00:26:48.031
or for not wanting to show it too much.

00:26:48.031 --> 00:26:50.213
The three of us are not
thinking about this word

00:26:50.213 --> 00:26:52.963
with a shared frame of reference.

00:26:53.905 --> 00:26:58.085
Mikhail Baryshnikov, who has
often been called a virtuoso,

00:26:58.085 --> 00:27:01.150
has said: "One part of me is dancing,

00:27:01.150 --> 00:27:04.327
"and the other observing from the side.

00:27:04.327 --> 00:27:07.949
"This control protects
you from an overdone,

00:27:07.949 --> 00:27:09.948
"vulgar presentation.

00:27:09.948 --> 00:27:13.665
"You constantly keep yourself
under fire, as it were.

00:27:13.665 --> 00:27:16.707
"You watch with an
ironic eye, as if saying,

00:27:16.707 --> 00:27:19.215
"well well, so you can do it,

00:27:19.215 --> 00:27:21.632
"but don't show it too much."

00:27:24.114 --> 00:27:26.596
In other words, perhaps
some kinds of virtuosity

00:27:26.596 --> 00:27:29.014
wouldn't have much power if
they weren't right on the edge

00:27:29.014 --> 00:27:32.347
of being vulgar or thoughtless or rough.

00:27:35.838 --> 00:27:40.005
Hank Shteamer, a music critic
and editor in Brooklyn:

00:27:41.320 --> 00:27:42.667
"I often think that Igor,

00:27:42.667 --> 00:27:44.641
"my Russian barber in the East Vilage,

00:27:44.641 --> 00:27:46.641
"in terms of virtuosity.

00:27:47.659 --> 00:27:51.119
"I'm not sure I've seen
anyone so casually,

00:27:51.119 --> 00:27:53.878
"almost brutally efficient
with their movements

00:27:53.878 --> 00:27:56.128
"and reflexes as this guy."

00:27:59.200 --> 00:28:01.171
Unless of course the opposite is true,

00:28:01.171 --> 00:28:04.610
virtuosity is right on the
edge of something so fine,

00:28:04.610 --> 00:28:07.193
it seems outside of human will.

00:28:10.322 --> 00:28:13.739
Zachary Wolf, a music critic in New York:

00:28:15.291 --> 00:28:17.358
"When I think about virtuosity,

00:28:17.358 --> 00:28:19.108
"I think about this."

00:28:20.632 --> 00:28:24.632
(woman singing classical music)

00:28:59.269 --> 00:29:01.589
"About lightness, about freedom,

00:29:01.589 --> 00:29:04.680
"but a freedom that follows the rules.

00:29:04.680 --> 00:29:07.013
"Virtuosity is law-abiding."

00:29:09.278 --> 00:29:12.087
V is too easily used as a cudgel,

00:29:12.087 --> 00:29:14.177
or a boast or a threat or an insult

00:29:14.177 --> 00:29:16.174
or a form of ogling.

00:29:16.174 --> 00:29:18.055
It puts its thumb on the scale.

00:29:18.055 --> 00:29:20.609
There's something about the
conversation-stopping charge

00:29:20.609 --> 00:29:24.533
around the word which implies that it is

00:29:24.533 --> 00:29:26.830
the last refinement,

00:29:26.830 --> 00:29:29.967
and most sensible people
agree that it is not.

00:29:29.967 --> 00:29:32.798
If it means anything, as
I've already suggested,

00:29:32.798 --> 00:29:35.028
it's a means to an end, of course.

00:29:35.028 --> 00:29:36.700
What is the end?

00:29:36.700 --> 00:29:38.395
Some kind of absolute freedom,

00:29:38.395 --> 00:29:40.994
or the discovery of a power in music

00:29:40.994 --> 00:29:45.161
that goes beyond notes and
musicians and audiences.

00:29:46.894 --> 00:29:49.814
It's been described in different ways.

00:29:49.814 --> 00:29:51.956
Murray Perahia gives the same
advice to younger pianists

00:29:51.956 --> 00:29:54.873
that Vladimir Horowitz gave to him.

00:29:55.993 --> 00:29:58.039
"To become more than a virtuoso,

00:29:58.039 --> 00:30:01.801
"first you have to become a virtuoso."

00:30:01.801 --> 00:30:05.005
The violist Kim Kashkashian,
who can hit all the notes,

00:30:05.005 --> 00:30:07.653
talks about a written score as a house

00:30:07.653 --> 00:30:09.649
which may be perfectly sound,

00:30:09.649 --> 00:30:12.992
but needs a conscience to live inside it.

00:30:12.992 --> 00:30:15.106
The extent to which you respect it

00:30:15.106 --> 00:30:16.430
and also fill it with yourself

00:30:16.430 --> 00:30:19.773
is something like your virtuosity.

00:30:19.773 --> 00:30:22.513
That's a paraphrase,
she said that yesterday.

00:30:22.513 --> 00:30:24.430
I didn't write it down.

00:30:25.623 --> 00:30:28.247
In musicians, virtuosity usually implies

00:30:28.247 --> 00:30:31.917
great charismatic fluency and dexterity,

00:30:31.917 --> 00:30:35.911
sometimes great memory
and problem-solving skill.

00:30:35.911 --> 00:30:38.651
Perhaps near the limits of human ability.

00:30:38.651 --> 00:30:42.134
Virtuosity is virtuous when it
is understood as disciplined

00:30:42.134 --> 00:30:42.967
and rare.

00:30:44.131 --> 00:30:46.825
It's corrupt when
understood as ingratiating

00:30:46.825 --> 00:30:50.992
or a matter of covering over
a lack of profound thought.

00:30:52.305 --> 00:30:54.046
Certainly, the word doesn't imply anything

00:30:54.046 --> 00:30:57.296
about artistic taste, whatever that is.

00:31:00.522 --> 00:31:04.588
Jason Moran, jazz
pianist in New York City:

00:31:04.588 --> 00:31:07.003
"Generally I think about Thelonious Monk

00:31:07.003 --> 00:31:09.394
"when I think about virtuosity.

00:31:09.394 --> 00:31:12.645
"In that people said he was not virtuosic.

00:31:12.645 --> 00:31:16.812
"And by people I mean idiot
assholes that don't know shit.

00:31:18.520 --> 00:31:21.724
"Monk defines it for me
because he does what he needs

00:31:21.724 --> 00:31:24.209
"to make the phrase shine bright.

00:31:24.209 --> 00:31:27.101
"He puts peroxide on the wound.

00:31:27.101 --> 00:31:29.240
"From the arpeggio down the entire piano

00:31:29.240 --> 00:31:31.144
"landing with a low boom,

00:31:31.144 --> 00:31:34.311
"like a stuntman knowing how to fall."

00:31:37.088 --> 00:31:40.682
In a funny way, the idea
of virtuosity in any arena

00:31:40.682 --> 00:31:44.842
implies tradition and
singularity at the same time.

00:31:44.842 --> 00:31:47.230
Virtuosity, the word and idea,

00:31:47.230 --> 00:31:51.397
is perhaps best understood
not as a neutral certificate,

00:31:52.344 --> 00:31:54.261
or an objective virtue,

00:31:55.107 --> 00:31:59.274
but as a set of specific
historical practices and values.

00:32:01.005 --> 00:32:04.442
Whether in say, Europe or
India or North America,

00:32:04.442 --> 00:32:06.346
involving teachers and gurus,

00:32:06.346 --> 00:32:08.691
performance expectations,
systems of media,

00:32:08.691 --> 00:32:12.824
specific strata of class,
race, culture, age,

00:32:12.824 --> 00:32:15.146
and specific marketplaces.

00:32:15.146 --> 00:32:18.257
It tells you everything about
the culture of the music,

00:32:18.257 --> 00:32:21.174
and nothing about the music itself.

00:32:23.571 --> 00:32:25.618
Dan Weiss, a drummer in New York:

00:32:25.618 --> 00:32:27.961
"I think of someone playing an instrument

00:32:27.961 --> 00:32:31.468
"or singing like they're
playing with a toy.

00:32:31.468 --> 00:32:33.635
"Just joy and zero effort.

00:32:35.742 --> 00:32:37.066
"Contemporary players?

00:32:37.066 --> 00:32:39.619
"One that comes to mind is Peter Evans.

00:32:39.619 --> 00:32:43.786
"Just completely sick and
devoid of technical restraints.

00:32:44.751 --> 00:32:48.441
"He's playing the instrument
as if it doesn't exist.

00:32:48.441 --> 00:32:49.774
"Big compliment.

00:32:51.111 --> 00:32:52.553
"Maybe that's what I'm getting at.

00:32:52.553 --> 00:32:54.246
"The music becomes more transparent,

00:32:54.246 --> 00:32:57.267
"and instruments or
voices become transcendent

00:32:57.267 --> 00:32:59.028
"and invisible.

00:32:59.028 --> 00:33:03.195
"The music is all present,
everything else disappears."

00:33:06.996 --> 00:33:10.990
I can't shake the thought,
this is me talking,

00:33:10.990 --> 00:33:14.078
I can't shake the thought that one can be

00:33:14.078 --> 00:33:16.702
not at all good at one's instrument

00:33:16.702 --> 00:33:19.605
in any traditional way,
or simply not wanna bother

00:33:19.605 --> 00:33:23.597
with appearing to be good,
and still be virtuosic.

00:33:23.597 --> 00:33:26.269
Rather, what that virtuoso might possess

00:33:26.269 --> 00:33:28.730
is confidence, grace,

00:33:28.730 --> 00:33:31.537
a knowledge of their own musical language,

00:33:31.537 --> 00:33:33.722
and an ambition that
just slightly outpaces

00:33:33.722 --> 00:33:36.369
their physical ability.

00:33:36.369 --> 00:33:39.620
They might be asserting
dominance over their instrument,

00:33:39.620 --> 00:33:43.985
but they're still chasing
something, mostly themselves.

00:33:43.985 --> 00:33:47.143
I saw Arto Lindsey do
this about a month ago.

00:33:47.143 --> 00:33:50.301
He sang, lightly, and
played electric guitar

00:33:50.301 --> 00:33:52.718
using only rhythm and timbre,

00:33:53.849 --> 00:33:56.292
without forming a single known chord,

00:33:56.292 --> 00:33:58.312
or playing a melody.

00:33:58.312 --> 00:34:00.448
And he did this while interacting

00:34:00.448 --> 00:34:04.883
with a Brazilian percussionist
of more traditional skills.

00:34:04.883 --> 00:34:07.484
He had set up speakers and
amplifiers on the floor

00:34:07.484 --> 00:34:09.063
throughout the room,

00:34:09.063 --> 00:34:11.919
so that a single rhythmic strike

00:34:11.919 --> 00:34:14.009
could ricochet in various patterns

00:34:14.009 --> 00:34:16.586
throughout the audience.

00:34:16.586 --> 00:34:19.882
It was somewhat confrontational.

00:34:19.882 --> 00:34:23.111
At the end of it he said
something I will never forget.

00:34:23.111 --> 00:34:27.278
He said, "thank you, I
hope we raised some doubt."

00:34:31.122 --> 00:34:34.419
And for me, the word works best in writing

00:34:34.419 --> 00:34:38.668
when its meaning and
function can be restricted,

00:34:38.668 --> 00:34:41.432
or laboriously defended,

00:34:41.432 --> 00:34:45.772
so that nobody takes
its power for granted.

00:34:45.772 --> 00:34:48.142
Or put in a strange context.

00:34:48.142 --> 00:34:52.972
Or made to modify an
intangible or negative thought.

00:34:52.972 --> 00:34:55.502
I've found that the word works beautifully

00:34:55.502 --> 00:34:59.497
when I'm praising musicians
for non-virtuosity.

00:34:59.497 --> 00:35:01.470
Ralph Ellison described his
fictional character Reinhardt

00:35:01.470 --> 00:35:05.637
in Invisible Man as an
American virtuoso of identity.

00:35:08.553 --> 00:35:10.106
That's good.

00:35:10.106 --> 00:35:14.149
Kit Lambert, who was one of
the early managers of The Who,

00:35:14.149 --> 00:35:18.421
once called Eric Clapton
a virtuoso of tedium.

00:35:18.421 --> 00:35:20.338
That's really good too.

00:35:22.090 --> 00:35:24.923
And a German music critic in 1844,

00:35:25.759 --> 00:35:29.842
quoted in Žarko Cvejić's
The Virtuoso as Subject,

00:35:31.632 --> 00:35:34.720
tellingly praised Franz Liszt as

00:35:34.720 --> 00:35:37.053
"more than a mere virtuoso."

00:35:40.851 --> 00:35:43.684
Iggy Pop, rockstar, Miami Florida:

00:35:46.423 --> 00:35:49.652
"The first words that
come to mind are boring,

00:35:49.652 --> 00:35:51.235
"clueless, noodler.

00:35:53.158 --> 00:35:57.059
"These words are in response
to an imaginary musician,

00:35:57.059 --> 00:35:59.962
"one we've all heard before,

00:35:59.962 --> 00:36:02.629
"who has done a lot of practice,

00:36:04.118 --> 00:36:08.201
"but not a lot of thinking,
or feeling or living.

00:36:09.293 --> 00:36:12.361
"However, I suspect that
in the classical tradition

00:36:12.361 --> 00:36:15.121
"in which the true virtuoso interprets

00:36:15.121 --> 00:36:17.121
"the composer's work,

00:36:17.121 --> 00:36:20.883
"physical skills at his or her disposal

00:36:20.883 --> 00:36:23.762
"may indeed free him or her to approach

00:36:23.762 --> 00:36:26.247
"a great performance, which nevertheless

00:36:26.247 --> 00:36:28.164
"must come from within.

00:36:29.730 --> 00:36:32.144
"And also it must come with awareness

00:36:32.144 --> 00:36:35.061
"of the most vulgar circumstances."

00:36:39.203 --> 00:36:41.014
I think what Iggy is talking about

00:36:41.014 --> 00:36:45.496
is that some virtuosos seem to
have a fixed outcome in mind.

00:36:45.496 --> 00:36:48.422
Perhaps that means drawing a border.

00:36:48.422 --> 00:36:51.045
It might be at a very high level.

00:36:51.045 --> 00:36:53.135
But it is fixed.

00:36:53.135 --> 00:36:55.271
And then there is Sarah Vaughan

00:36:55.271 --> 00:36:58.081
singing Lullaby of Birdland.

00:36:58.081 --> 00:37:00.148
The typical and limited ways

00:37:00.148 --> 00:37:03.004
one might evaluate other great singers,

00:37:03.004 --> 00:37:06.789
that they operate best within
certain particular ranges,

00:37:06.789 --> 00:37:09.621
or that they're in charge of
certain particular effects,

00:37:09.621 --> 00:37:12.704
seem not really to apply well to her.

00:37:14.308 --> 00:37:17.656
To me, every single sound she makes

00:37:17.656 --> 00:37:20.790
is equally purposeful, strong, stylish,

00:37:20.790 --> 00:37:22.873
disciplined, articulated.

00:37:23.946 --> 00:37:26.293
What she's doing suggests achievement,

00:37:26.293 --> 00:37:29.080
and usually an achievement
is measured by an evaluation,

00:37:29.080 --> 00:37:31.123
but she makes you think
about what she's doing

00:37:31.123 --> 00:37:33.492
in a way that must be
categorically different

00:37:33.492 --> 00:37:36.556
from evaluation, because
she's conjuring levels

00:37:36.556 --> 00:37:40.759
of achievement that never
would've occurred to you.

00:37:40.759 --> 00:37:42.826
That is more than mere.

00:37:42.826 --> 00:37:45.493
There should be a word for that.

00:37:47.540 --> 00:37:50.674
Arto Lindsey, musician, Rio de Janeiro:

00:37:50.674 --> 00:37:54.341
"If I consider it as
it's usually conceived,

00:37:55.272 --> 00:37:57.287
"I think about controlling
many aspects of performance

00:37:57.287 --> 00:37:58.916
"at the same time.

00:37:58.916 --> 00:38:00.933
"I think about technique close to an edge

00:38:00.933 --> 00:38:04.026
"where it will lose control of itself,

00:38:04.026 --> 00:38:06.046
"where technique is honed
past being an issue.

00:38:06.046 --> 00:38:08.296
"Virtue gives way to grace.

00:38:11.381 --> 00:38:13.848
"Or, I can think about
establishing a virtuosity

00:38:13.848 --> 00:38:16.402
"of indeterminate skills,

00:38:16.402 --> 00:38:19.304
"scales of diminishing self-control.

00:38:19.304 --> 00:38:23.670
"Places we can go when
we're absent from ourselves.

00:38:23.670 --> 00:38:25.922
"Or, just admit that when
I think about virtuosity,

00:38:25.922 --> 00:38:30.659
"I think about getting
over it, getting past it."

00:38:30.659 --> 00:38:33.826
And now, I am getting past virtuosity.

00:38:36.484 --> 00:38:37.317
Thank you.

00:38:38.484 --> 00:38:41.651
(audience applauding)

00:38:46.565 --> 00:38:48.841
