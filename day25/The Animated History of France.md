00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:06.790
France.

00:00:06.790 --> 00:00:08.060
The land of baguette

00:00:08.060 --> 00:00:09.520
croissants

00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:10.380
brioche

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:11.880
croutons

00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:13.760
fougasse

00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:14.680
miche

00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:16.619
 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:18.180
France.

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:20.380
Home to the capital of love, romance

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:21.360
and sex in

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:22.440
French

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:24.840
Wh- who

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:26.420
who's writing these scripts

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:33.120
The first traces of France in written history

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:36.180
appeared around 1000 BC, during the Iron Age.

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:37.660
Around that time, it was known as Gaul,

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:40.830
and was occupied by the Romans, Greeks, and Carthaginians.

00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:42.640
Despite what their orgies and brothels would have you think

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:44.800
the Romans weren't big on sharing

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:46.260
and Caesar invaded Gaul and annexed it

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:48.530
to the Roman Empire in 51 BC.

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:50.620
After the collapse of the Roman Empire, the

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:53.250
Franks took over Gaul: first, the Merovingian

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:55.880
dynasty led by Clovis I, then the Carolingian

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:58.150
dynasty, featuring important figures such

00:00:58.150 --> 00:01:01.320
as Charles Martel, Pepin the Short, and Charlemagne.

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:02.900
The end of the 10th century saw the fall of

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:04.689
the Carolingian dynasty, brought about by

00:01:04.689 --> 00:01:06.130
Viking invasions.

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:09.160
From 987 till 1643, the Monarchy of France

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:10.710
was in the hands of a series of Philips, Henries,

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:13.690
Charleses, and Louises.

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:16.260
In 1643, Louis the XIVth rose to power

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:18.450
and all he gave France was a lavish palace [Versailles],

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:20.840
a dramaturge [Moliere] and a weak Louis the XVth.

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:23.840
But really, this badass assumed the throne at 4 years old.

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:26.299
At that age you were probably still sucking on some tit.

00:01:26.299 --> 00:01:28.594
He expanded France and made it the most powerful

00:01:28.594 --> 00:01:29.550
country of its time.

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:31.400
The 18th century witnessed the birth of the

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:33.110
Age of Enlightenment, when a group of pompous

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:34.880
French philosophers and scientists [Voltaire, Diderot, Montesquieu]

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:35.619
gathered in dark rooms

00:01:35.619 --> 00:01:37.720
to write books, discuss political affairs

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:38.750
and make out.

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:42.240
On the 14th of July 1789, a group of insurgents

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:43.800
motivated by the Enlightenment’s principles

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:45.760
of “Liberty, Equality, Fraternity”

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:48.720
took the Bastille prison and started the French Revolution.

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:50.720
In August, the National Assembly adopted the

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:53.020
Declaration of Rights of the Man and the Citizen,

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:55.220
attempting to write a constitution, and abolished

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:57.310
the privileges of the nobles and the clergy.

00:01:57.310 --> 00:01:59.880
After that, the Revolution quickly degenerated:

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:02.060
Louis the XVIth, the last king of France,

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:04.240
was executed, and Robespierre, one of the

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:07.240
rebels, established a Reign of Terror in 1793.

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:09.980
In 1799, Napoleon came along and reinstated

00:02:09.980 --> 00:02:11.220
order and stability.

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:13.379
He also established the First Republic.

00:02:13.379 --> 00:02:16.499
In 1918, France was on the winning side of World War I.

00:02:16.499 --> 00:02:18.500
After engaging in socialist reforms led by

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:20.139
The Popular Front and Leon Blum following

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:21.220
the Great Depression

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:27.739
France went to war again
[World War II].

00:02:27.739 --> 00:02:29.840
The Germans quickly defeated the French military,

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:31.909
and Paris fell on June 14 1940.

00:02:31.909 --> 00:02:35.219
By 1942, Germany occupied all of Vichy France.

00:02:35.219 --> 00:02:37.300
On the opposite side, General Charles De Gaulle

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:39.059
announced on BBC radio that he was at the

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:40.680
head of the Resistance, gathering the

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:43.200
French Free Forces and fighting for France’s freedom.

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:46.200
In 1944, the Allies landed in Normandy and Provence

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:49.000
and liberated the country from Germany occupation.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.480
This was not France’s first or last military failure,

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:53.780
because in 1954, the French surrendered

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:56.480
in Vietnam, and then again in 1962, giving

00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:58.019
Algeria its independence.

00:02:58.019 --> 00:03:00.300
Today France is the 6th largest economy by

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:03.389
nominal GDP and the 22nd most developed country.

00:03:03.389 --> 00:03:04.840
Paris is one of the world’s most beautiful

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:06.900
cities, and you should all go there to try out

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:08.360
their cheese, wine

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:10.720
and see how much baguette you can fit up your ass.
