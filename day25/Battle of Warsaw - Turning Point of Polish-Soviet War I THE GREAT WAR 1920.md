00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:27.320
It’s August 1920, and the armies of Bolshevik
Russia have reached the gates of the capital.

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:33.180
Desperate Polish forces prepare to defend
the city – and maybe even prevent the spread

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:37.880
of the revolution to Central Europe: it’s
the Battle of Warsaw.

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:55.140
Hi, I’m Jesse Alexander and welcome to The
Great War.

00:00:55.150 --> 00:01:00.870
By August 1920, the Polish-Soviet War had
been raging for over a year.

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:06.440
What had started as a guerilla border war
had turned into a full-on conventional conflict

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:13.430
in the spring of 1920, as Polish forces advanced
east into Belarus and Ukraine, capturing Kiev

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:14.930
in May.

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:20.870
But the Red Army recovered and launched a
major counterattack, which would reach a dramatic

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:27.020
and decisive stage at the Battle of Warsaw
100 years ago.

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:32.620
The Red Army offensive began in June, when
the Southwest Front, under General Yegorov

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:38.600
and the political supervision of Joseph Stalin,
pushed the Poles back in bloody fighting.

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:44.040
After the initial victory near Kiev, General
Semyon Budyonni’s 1st Cavalry Army captured

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:48.530
Rowne, Lutsk, Brody, and had surrounded Lwow.

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:54.950
This advance was slowed by determined Polish
resistance and skilful use of fortified towns

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:59.650
and cavalry by the Polish commander, General
Edvard Rydz-Smigly.

00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:02.870
The fight for Brody was particularly bloody.

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:10.130
Isaac Babel, who was with the Red Army, recalled
the aftermath: “A field of horror, strewn

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:19.450
with `mangled` dead, inhuman cruelty, unimaginable
wounds, crushed skulls, young, white naked

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:27.070
bodies flashing in the sun, lost notebooks
laying about, single pages, paybooks, prayer

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:29.990
books, human corpses in the grain.”

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:35.840
(Lehnstaedt 89) By early August, the Red Army
had stopped at Lwow, in what had become a

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:37.980
drawn-out siege.

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:43.170
The main Bolshevik offensive was launched
further north in July, by General Mikhail

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:46.880
Tukhachevsky’s Western Front in Belarus.

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:52.600
After three days of fighting, Polish lines
broke and the Bolshevik advance began to gather

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:54.030
momentum.

00:02:54.030 --> 00:03:02.260
The Reds had about 160,000 combat troops against
about 115,000 under Polish General Szeptycki

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:06.940
– and the Bolsheviks had a 3 to 1 advantage
in artillery (Lehnstaedt 85).

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:12.090
But the cavalry was the key to the Red Army’s
success, as mounted units used the wide open

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:16.569
spaces to outflank and surround Polish units.

00:03:16.569 --> 00:03:22.280
Tukhachevsky, who was himself partly of Polish
origin, was younger and more willing to take

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:27.670
risks than his older Polish counterparts,
and it paid off.

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:32.959
In particular, the advance was led by the
1st Red Cavalry Corps, under Persian-born

00:03:32.959 --> 00:03:37.211
Armenian General Hayk Bzhishkyan, better known
as Gaia Gai.

00:03:37.211 --> 00:03:43.569
Gai was able to keep the Poles off balance
by using the Lithuanian and German borders

00:03:43.569 --> 00:03:49.280
to cover his flank, and even managed to defeat
a Polish force equipped with French tanks

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:52.440
at Grodno on July 19.

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:58.530
One advantage they had was that Polish intelligence
had been able to read some Red Army telegrams

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:03.629
within a few days of them being sent, which
did help the Poles try to predict the general

00:04:03.629 --> 00:04:09.420
disposition of Bolshevik forces . The Poles
also tried to stabilize the front by using

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:14.510
old German trenches from the Great War, but
could not stem the tide.

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:19.539
During the Red Army’s advance, Lithuania
joined in on the Bolshevik side, to recover

00:04:19.539 --> 00:04:24.599
the disputed city of Wilno, Vilnius, from
the Poles.

00:04:24.599 --> 00:04:32.009
By August 1, the Red Army was in Bialystok
and Brest-Litovsk, just 200km from Warsaw.

00:04:32.009 --> 00:04:37.419
A week after that, Tukhachevsky’s spearheads
were northwest of the Polish capital, which

00:04:37.419 --> 00:04:41.610
came under direct threat of encirclement.

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:47.439
So within a month of launching their attack,
the Red Army was deep in the heart of Poland.

00:04:47.439 --> 00:04:52.889
The rapid advance of Bolshevik forces now
plunged the country into a crisis, which both

00:04:52.889 --> 00:04:56.120
united and divided its citizens.

00:04:56.120 --> 00:05:03.039
The string of defeats had deeply shaken the
Polish army, government and society.

00:05:03.039 --> 00:05:08.409
The army had suffered heavy losses, lacked
weapons and equipment, and morale was on the

00:05:08.409 --> 00:05:10.389
verge of collapse.

00:05:10.389 --> 00:05:16.569
Desertions increased, some officers openly
spoke of a coming Bolshevik victory, and many

00:05:16.569 --> 00:05:19.629
civilians fled the city.

00:05:19.629 --> 00:05:24.409
Some unions called for peace with Russia.

00:05:24.409 --> 00:05:32.309
Pilsudski was painfully aware of the situation:
“This breakdown of our forces, this sinking

00:05:32.309 --> 00:05:36.439
morale was, in my view, [Tukhachevski’s]
greatest triumph.”

00:05:36.439 --> 00:05:42.460
(Lehnstaedt 89) and he later admitted: “I
could not trust the morale of the troops or

00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:46.069
the civilians, or the leaders of either group.”

00:05:46.069 --> 00:05:47.650
(Lehnstaedt 115).

00:05:47.650 --> 00:05:50.979
The government also faced a political crisis.

00:05:50.979 --> 00:05:56.779
Partisan divisions in the Polish parliament
became even more intense than usual, and Pilsudski

00:05:56.779 --> 00:06:00.479
twice offered his resignation, which was refused.

00:06:00.479 --> 00:06:06.039
Prime Minister Grabski resigned, and was replaced
by Wincenty Witos, the head of the Peasant

00:06:06.039 --> 00:06:07.039
Party.

00:06:07.039 --> 00:06:11.949
Witos headed up an all-party government which
weakened Pilsudki’s socialists, but was

00:06:11.949 --> 00:06:17.020
expected to be more appealing to the Bolsheviks
during negotiations.

00:06:17.020 --> 00:06:21.969
Things were so bad that Pilsudski sought to
overcome the difficulties in parliament by

00:06:21.969 --> 00:06:28.000
creating the Council of National Defence,
which in some ways functioned as a parallel

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:29.210
parliament.

00:06:29.210 --> 00:06:32.909
The crisis also worsened relations between
Catholics and Jews.

00:06:32.909 --> 00:06:37.589
There had already been numerous outbreaks
of anti-Semitic violence and pogroms during

00:06:37.589 --> 00:06:43.309
the war, and now that defeat seemed near,
the association of Jews with the Bolshevik

00:06:43.309 --> 00:06:46.539
enemy caused trouble in the army.

00:06:46.539 --> 00:06:53.839
The War Ministry placed a quota for Jews in
the army, limiting them to 5% of the army.

00:06:53.839 --> 00:06:59.219
Some Jews had joined the Bolsheviks, but most
accepted conscription, and Jews already made

00:06:59.219 --> 00:07:02.210
up more than 5% of Polish troops.

00:07:02.210 --> 00:07:07.469
As a result, thousands were put into labour
battalions digging trenches around Warsaw,

00:07:07.469 --> 00:07:11.249
and others were simply kept in internment
camps.

00:07:11.249 --> 00:07:16.999
This measure was removed after the Battle
of Warsaw, which some took as vindication

00:07:16.999 --> 00:07:19.180
of a Jewish-Bolshevik conspiracy.

00:07:19.180 --> 00:07:20.619
(Lehnstaedt 112-113).

00:07:20.619 --> 00:07:26.219
The threat to Poland and its capital also
laid bare the divide between the peasants,

00:07:26.219 --> 00:07:31.550
who made up the majority of the population,
and m iddle-class urban residents, especially

00:07:31.550 --> 00:07:33.999
the educated.

00:07:33.999 --> 00:07:39.800
Peasants had suffered terribly since 1914,
and resented the state’s inability to protect

00:07:39.800 --> 00:07:43.419
and care for them when in the army.

00:07:43.419 --> 00:07:50.100
They often felt less connected to the nation
than their urban counterparts: “The peasants

00:07:50.100 --> 00:07:55.330
held the Polish elites responsible for an
independence which in their eyes had only

00:07:55.330 --> 00:08:01.289
replaced the habitual prewar order with a
lot of trouble at the new state’s borders

00:08:01.289 --> 00:08:04.409
which was now about to descend upon them.”

00:08:04.409 --> 00:08:14.139
(Boehler 131) Slowikowski recalled a peasant
in his unit scoffed at the notion of fighting

00:08:14.139 --> 00:08:19.360
for national honour: “What does honor give
me when the lice are biting?!

00:08:19.360 --> 00:08:21.560
Did you see all the soldiers from our company?

00:08:21.560 --> 00:08:24.599
Do they all have boots on their feet?

00:08:24.599 --> 00:08:27.419
And you know how many haven’t got shirts?

00:08:27.419 --> 00:08:30.319
Their uniforms are draped on naked bodies.

00:08:30.319 --> 00:08:31.999
Honor, my ass!

00:08:31.999 --> 00:08:38.630
If there’s nothing to eat, the lice are
biting, and the soldiers have no underpants.

00:08:38.630 --> 00:08:43.800
[…] Whoever wants war is welcome to fight,
but it’s a farmer’s job to cultivate the

00:08:43.800 --> 00:08:44.800
soil.”

00:08:44.800 --> 00:08:48.060
(Boehler 134-135)
Although the crisis facing Poland in August

00:08:48.060 --> 00:08:54.550
1920 caused tensions in Polish society, it
had also galvanized and unified some groups,

00:08:54.550 --> 00:08:56.740
especially the urban middle class.

00:08:56.740 --> 00:09:00.510
For high school graduate and army volunteer
Michal Slowikowski, the coming battle was

00:09:00.510 --> 00:09:06.530
personal: “The question of whether Warsaw
would defend itself was an issue not only

00:09:06.530 --> 00:09:11.200
for the nation, but for individual citizens,
too.

00:09:11.200 --> 00:09:15.370
Could the beautiful `mirage` of freedom really
be coming to an end?”

00:09:15.370 --> 00:09:20.530
(Boehler 134) Urbanites like Slowikowski were
united like never before by the threat to

00:09:20.530 --> 00:09:21.710
their nation.

00:09:21.710 --> 00:09:28.660
100,000 men volunteered for the army, mostly
students, scouts, and craftsmen.

00:09:28.660 --> 00:09:34.180
Peasants were under-represented among volunteers,
but they did accept the draft of 1920.

00:09:34.180 --> 00:09:39.740
Women also volunteered in non-combat roles
like sewing uniforms and nursing.

00:09:39.740 --> 00:09:46.470
The Church, political parties, civic societies
and professional associations all mobilized

00:09:46.470 --> 00:09:48.680
like never before.

00:09:48.680 --> 00:09:54.690
Despite the suspicions of their fellow citizens,
many middle-class Jews also donated money

00:09:54.690 --> 00:10:00.430
and volunteered to fight, and most workers’
unions also supported the cause.

00:10:00.430 --> 00:10:05.500
This national mobilization of the middle and
educated classes and the Church crystalized

00:10:05.500 --> 00:10:10.340
around the idea of Poland as the defender
of Christian European civilization against

00:10:10.340 --> 00:10:17.530
the lesser, barbarous and foreign civilization
of the east, sometimes portrayed as Judeo-Bolshevik,

00:10:17.530 --> 00:10:20.870
and sometimes as quote “tatar-byzantine.”

00:10:20.870 --> 00:10:27.030
Prince Lubomirski reflected this view in a
speech: “The war which Poland is carrying

00:10:27.030 --> 00:10:33.520
on is not one of conquest, but exclusively
one of defense.

00:10:33.520 --> 00:10:38.770
The Bolsheviks invaded Poland at the moment
of its liberation and we were forced to take

00:10:38.770 --> 00:10:41.519
up arms in our defense.

00:10:41.519 --> 00:10:47.510
[…] We have only wanted to protect those
regions peopled by Polish subjects, to liberate

00:10:47.510 --> 00:10:53.560
them from the oppression of Bolshevism, and
to create around us friendly nations who will

00:10:53.560 --> 00:10:58.110
stand with us against the barbarism of the
East.”

00:10:58.110 --> 00:11:05.400
(Reed 223) Pilsudski himself was more concerned
with Polish sovereignty and borders than ideological

00:11:05.400 --> 00:11:06.570
questions.

00:11:06.570 --> 00:11:12.500
Poland was both divided and united in the
face of defeat – and it also called on its

00:11:12.500 --> 00:11:14.720
British and French Allies to help.

00:11:14.720 --> 00:11:18.180
French and British reactions
The existence of Poland as an independent

00:11:18.180 --> 00:11:24.950
state was vital to the post-war order the
British and French were trying to create.

00:11:24.950 --> 00:11:29.670
Poland was to play a role in containing Bolshevism
on the one hand, and in weakening Germany

00:11:29.670 --> 00:11:33.390
on the other, but there were also disagreements.

00:11:33.390 --> 00:11:38.930
The French were more strident in their anti-Bolshevik
position, whereas the British had tried to

00:11:38.930 --> 00:11:44.120
gain influence by entering into trade negotiations
with them.

00:11:44.120 --> 00:11:50.180
Both Britain and France had clashed with Poland
over the extent of Polish territorial claims,

00:11:50.180 --> 00:11:53.120
and over the rights of minorities in Poland.

00:11:53.120 --> 00:11:58.200
Now, the looming victory of the Red Army spurred
Allied action.

00:11:58.200 --> 00:12:04.300
An Inter-Allied Military Commission was sent
to advise the Poles, led by General Henrys

00:12:04.300 --> 00:12:06.250
and Viscount D’Abernon.

00:12:06.250 --> 00:12:10.490
The officers of the commission, however, like
General Weygand and Charles de Gaulle, were

00:12:10.490 --> 00:12:15.700
sometimes ignored by their Polish counterparts,
since their experience with trench warfare

00:12:15.700 --> 00:12:22.320
on the Western Front did not apply to the
wide-open spaces and smaller firepower in

00:12:22.320 --> 00:12:23.720
the East.

00:12:23.720 --> 00:12:29.320
The British and French also got involved directly
with the Poles and Bolsheviks at the negotiating

00:12:29.320 --> 00:12:30.320
table.

00:12:30.320 --> 00:12:36.400
In July, they forced the Poles to accept,
in principle, a border at the Curzon Line,

00:12:36.400 --> 00:12:40.470
even though the Poles wanted a border further
east.

00:12:40.470 --> 00:12:44.470
The British then gave an ultimatum to the
Bolsheviks, demanding that they stop their

00:12:44.470 --> 00:12:50.470
advance at the line or the Allies would be
free to assist the Poles more directly, and

00:12:50.470 --> 00:12:55.780
the economically important trade deal talks
between Britain and Russia would be stopped.

00:12:55.780 --> 00:13:02.080
This sounded like a serious threat, but British
and French hands were partly tied by domestic

00:13:02.080 --> 00:13:06.170
politics, since there was no stomach for a
new war.

00:13:06.170 --> 00:13:11.680
So the Allies were attempting to help Poland,
even though the relationship was a difficult

00:13:11.680 --> 00:13:12.680
one.

00:13:12.680 --> 00:13:16.610
Meanwhile, the Bolsheviks had problems of
their own.

00:13:16.610 --> 00:13:21.000
Success on the battlefield had presented some
new problems for the Bolsheviks.

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:26.030
As the Red Army advanced westwards, there
were disagreements about what to do next,

00:13:26.030 --> 00:13:29.100
and internal rivalries heated up.

00:13:29.100 --> 00:13:35.170
Commander in Chief Sergey Kamenev wanted to
stop at the Curzon Line, whereas War Commissar

00:13:35.170 --> 00:13:41.480
Leon Trotsky thought the army should be able
to cross the line temporarily if necessary.

00:13:41.480 --> 00:13:48.130
Lenin was more hawkish, and orders were given
to push past the Curzon Line in mid-July.

00:13:48.130 --> 00:13:54.750
The Bolsheviks also wasted no time in setting
up puppet soviet states in Galicia and also

00:13:54.750 --> 00:13:56.279
in Poland.

00:13:56.279 --> 00:14:01.980
The Polish Revolutionary Committee was established
in Bialystok and headed up by Polish Bolshevik

00:14:01.980 --> 00:14:07.250
Feliks Dzerzhinsky, head of the Cheka secret
police.

00:14:07.250 --> 00:14:12.600
The Polish Revolutionary Committee made no
bones about what they had planned: “All

00:14:12.600 --> 00:14:18.680
representatives of the Polish bourgeoisie
and landowners, all who support White Poland,

00:14:18.680 --> 00:14:22.420
will be arrested and sent to concentration
camps.”

00:14:22.420 --> 00:14:26.700
(Engelstein 501)
Now although the Bolsheviks had plans to rule

00:14:26.700 --> 00:14:33.120
Poland and Galicia, there is a debate about
how far or under what circumstances they wanted

00:14:33.120 --> 00:14:38.440
to use the expected victory in Poland to spread
the revolution into Europe.

00:14:38.440 --> 00:14:44.160
Some, from the leadership down to the lower
ranks, like Isaac Babel, felt that the Red

00:14:44.160 --> 00:14:51.120
Army was on an unstoppable historical march:
“We will wage war forever.

00:14:51.120 --> 00:14:54.210
Russia has thrown down the gauntlet.

00:14:54.210 --> 00:14:57.820
We will march into Europe to conquer the world.

00:14:57.820 --> 00:15:02.110
The Red Army has become a factor in world
politics.”

00:15:02.110 --> 00:15:03.150
(Lehnstaedt 93).

00:15:03.150 --> 00:15:08.090
But given the weakness of the Red Army, it
is unlikely that this could have been achieved

00:15:08.090 --> 00:15:10.190
by force alone.

00:15:10.190 --> 00:15:15.000
Because of this, some historians have emphasized
the Bolshevik leadership’s caution.

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:21.450
Tukhachevsky, for example, wanted to offer
Germany its 1914 borders, even though he made

00:15:21.450 --> 00:15:25.470
public statements about bringing the revolution
to the heart of Europe.

00:15:25.470 --> 00:15:30.420
Lenin, on the other hand, hoped that if the
Red Army was able to get close enough to Germany,

00:15:30.420 --> 00:15:35.820
Hungary, and Romania after defeating Poland,
the workers of Central Europe would rise up

00:15:35.820 --> 00:15:43.529
in revolution on their own – though no specific
military plans for this were drawn up.

00:15:43.529 --> 00:15:49.640
Stalin and Polish Bolshevik Karl Radek thought
a European revolution unlikely, and Trotsky

00:15:49.640 --> 00:15:55.620
feared Allied intervention if the Red Army
went too far – but there was general agreement

00:15:55.620 --> 00:16:01.280
that Poland’s presence in Ukraine and Belarus
was a strategic threat to Russia.

00:16:01.280 --> 00:16:07.420
In the end, both ideological and military
reasons contributed to the Bolshevik decision

00:16:07.420 --> 00:16:11.350
to continue the invasion of Poland past the
Curzon Line.

00:16:11.350 --> 00:16:16.779
While the Red Army marched and Bolshevik leaders
debated internally, negotiations with the

00:16:16.779 --> 00:16:19.020
Allies and the Poles went on.

00:16:19.020 --> 00:16:24.601
A series of talks took place, which reached
their peak in early August after the Poles

00:16:24.601 --> 00:16:29.070
requested talks, and the British proposed
conference.

00:16:29.070 --> 00:16:34.040
There was much back and forth, with the British
threating to cancel trade talks with Russia,

00:16:34.040 --> 00:16:39.250
and the Soviets suggesting a Polish border
east of the Curzon Line, but at the price

00:16:39.250 --> 00:16:42.420
of a disarmed Polish military.

00:16:42.420 --> 00:16:48.210
Bolshevik Lev Kamenev assured British Prime
Minister Lloyd George Poland’s independence

00:16:48.210 --> 00:16:53.610
was safe: “[The Red Army advance did] not
predetermine in the slightest the question

00:16:53.610 --> 00:16:59.330
of the character of the peace treaty and does
not constitute a threat to the independence

00:16:59.330 --> 00:17:04.330
and integrity of the Polish state in its ethnic
borders.”

00:17:04.330 --> 00:17:09.020
(Engelstein 503) But the British intercepted
telegrams that showed the Bolsheviks were

00:17:09.020 --> 00:17:16.269
not sincere, and were stalling to allow their
forces to decide the issue on the battlefield.

00:17:16.269 --> 00:17:22.019
Viscount D’Abernon was outraged: “[The
Bolsheviks] pride themselves in hitting below

00:17:22.019 --> 00:17:25.139
the belt and in breaking their word.”

00:17:25.139 --> 00:17:30.070
(Engelstein 503) This was all part of the
Bolshevik strategy pairing negotiations geared

00:17:30.070 --> 00:17:36.509
to buy time with military action, which they
had used in the spring negotiations with Poland

00:17:36.509 --> 00:17:37.950
as well.

00:17:37.950 --> 00:17:43.450
So the Bolsheviks were divided – but they
were able to buy time while negotiating, and

00:17:43.450 --> 00:17:47.669
now their army was on the cusp of victory.

00:17:47.669 --> 00:17:53.980
Except that the Red Army that stood at the
gates of Warsaw was more fragile than it looked.

00:17:53.980 --> 00:17:59.259
One thing that put the Red Army in a difficult
position was the lack of coordination between

00:17:59.259 --> 00:18:03.620
Tukhachevsky’s Western front and Yegorov’s
Southwestern front.

00:18:03.620 --> 00:18:08.889
Geography played a role, since the two armies
were divided by the natural barrier of the

00:18:08.889 --> 00:18:13.799
Pripet Marshes, but politics was the real
problem.

00:18:13.799 --> 00:18:20.240
Trotsky and Tukhachevsky were close, whereas
Stalin, Budyonni and Yegorov formed a rival

00:18:20.240 --> 00:18:21.240
clique.

00:18:21.240 --> 00:18:26.590
Militarily, it made sense for the Southwest
front to shift as many forces as it could

00:18:26.590 --> 00:18:31.869
to help the Western front at Warsaw instead
of wasting time in Galicia.

00:18:31.869 --> 00:18:38.679
Tukhachevsky pressured Kamenev to do this,
but Kamenev at first issued unclear orders.

00:18:38.679 --> 00:18:44.149
Stalin and Budyonni delayed, and argued that
they could not move west until they had taken

00:18:44.149 --> 00:18:45.580
Lwow.

00:18:45.580 --> 00:18:50.520
The presence of General Vrangel’s White
forces in Crimea was also a distraction, as

00:18:50.520 --> 00:18:57.030
Stalin wrote to Lenin on August 12 – just
days before the Battle of Warsaw began: “It

00:18:57.030 --> 00:19:03.039
is my impression that the commander in chief
and his boys are sabotaging the work of organizing

00:19:03.039 --> 00:19:04.610
victory over Wrangel.

00:19:04.610 --> 00:19:10.909
In any case, they do not show a tenth of the
desire to win that they certainly show in

00:19:10.909 --> 00:19:12.330
the fight against Poland.”

00:19:12.330 --> 00:19:17.679
(Engelstein 506) All this infighting would
waste precious time that the Red Army would

00:19:17.679 --> 00:19:20.139
soon desperately need.

00:19:20.139 --> 00:19:24.159
And they weren’t getting the support from
the Polish population that Lenin had counted

00:19:24.159 --> 00:19:31.710
on either – most Catholic Poles were hostile
to the Bolsheviks, just as Stalin had predicted.

00:19:31.710 --> 00:19:37.620
The behaviour of Red Army troops as they advanced
did not endear them to the locals either – both

00:19:37.620 --> 00:19:43.820
Christians and Jews were targeted in spite
of friendly Bolshevik propaganda, as Isaac

00:19:43.820 --> 00:19:50.330
Babel recorded: “The population expects
a saviour, the Jews expect freedom – and

00:19:50.330 --> 00:19:53.279
the Kuban Cossacks come riding in…”

00:19:53.279 --> 00:19:58.419
(Lehnstaedt 94) Local Poles sometimes rose
up against the invaders, and there were attacks

00:19:58.419 --> 00:20:05.019
on local Jews, as a Red Army report indicated:
“[The locals] emerged onto the roads, entire

00:20:05.019 --> 00:20:12.890
villages at a time, armed with rifles, pitchforks,
[and] axes, attacking our supply trains, capturing

00:20:12.890 --> 00:20:14.049
soldiers.

00:20:14.049 --> 00:20:19.860
Communists, Jews, commissars were shot; Russians
were roughed up.”

00:20:19.860 --> 00:20:24.270
(Engelstein 510)
As if that weren’t bad enough for the Bolsheviks,

00:20:24.270 --> 00:20:28.960
despite recent victories, the Red Army had
been weakened.

00:20:28.960 --> 00:20:35.790
Poland had been devasted by years of war since
1914, and passable roads, intact bridges,

00:20:35.790 --> 00:20:40.460
and food were rare, which led to problems
of supply and morale.

00:20:40.460 --> 00:20:46.470
Isaac Babel recalled a letter home he wrote
for illiterate soldier: “Send me what you

00:20:46.470 --> 00:20:48.989
can, what you are able to.

00:20:48.989 --> 00:20:55.950
Please slaughter the spotted wild boar and
send me a parcel…Every day I go to bed hungry

00:20:55.950 --> 00:20:59.610
and without clothes, so it’s terribly cold.”

00:20:59.610 --> 00:21:06.529
(Lehnstaedt 83) Combined with combat losses
and desertion, about 116,000 Bolshevik troops

00:21:06.529 --> 00:21:11.360
now faced 156,000 Polish defenders (Lehnstaedt
118).

00:21:11.360 --> 00:21:18.270
So a vulnerable Red Army under divided leadership
now stood ready for the final assault on Warsaw,

00:21:18.270 --> 00:21:21.590
and perhaps victory in the war.

00:21:21.590 --> 00:21:26.860
Tukhachevsky’s launched his assault on Warsaw
from the east and north.

00:21:26.860 --> 00:21:32.030
He knew his forces were overextended, but
gambled that the poles would not be able to

00:21:32.030 --> 00:21:34.049
react in time.

00:21:34.049 --> 00:21:39.610
East of the city, Polish forces occupied new
trenches dug in haste, as well as old German

00:21:39.610 --> 00:21:46.110
trenches left over from the Great War, and
Polish General Lucjan Zeligowski admired the

00:21:46.110 --> 00:21:51.809
Germans’ handiwork: “One must admit that
they built [their trenches] very well.”

00:21:51.809 --> 00:21:57.879
(Lehnstaedt 123) Near Radzymin, on August
14, the Red 16th Army began to push against

00:21:57.879 --> 00:22:02.590
Polish defences, and at first drove the Poles
back.

00:22:02.590 --> 00:22:07.740
But General Haller’s defenders rallied,
and soon recaptured the lost ground and more

00:22:07.740 --> 00:22:14.950
, with the help of French tanks – a victory
did wonders for Polish morale, and some historians

00:22:14.950 --> 00:22:19.299
have argued that this was the decisive turn
in the battle.

00:22:19.299 --> 00:22:24.570
To the north of the city, things went equally
badly for Gaia Gai’s Red cavalry.

00:22:24.570 --> 00:22:30.480
They were stopped by inexperienced Polish
forces under General Sikorski in an unlikely

00:22:30.480 --> 00:22:35.330
victory that prevented Warsaw from being enveloped
from the north.

00:22:35.330 --> 00:22:41.660
Sikorski’s attack was a very risky move,
and the chance destruction of a Red Army radio

00:22:41.660 --> 00:22:47.429
transmitter has been said to have avoided
a Polish catastrophe by interrupting Bolshevik

00:22:47.429 --> 00:22:50.690
communications at a critical moment.

00:22:50.690 --> 00:22:55.769
Some historians consider this battle north
of the city to have been the decisive moment,

00:22:55.769 --> 00:22:57.529
not Radzymin.

00:22:57.529 --> 00:23:03.070
Regardless of which was more important, both
of these fronts had to hold long enough for

00:23:03.070 --> 00:23:07.360
Pilsudski’s planned counterattack in the
south to work.

00:23:07.360 --> 00:23:13.039
Since August 6, the Poles had been planning
a very risky counteroffensive, which would

00:23:13.039 --> 00:23:17.499
lead either to a smashing victory, or total
defeat.

00:23:17.499 --> 00:23:23.039
He ordered a difficult re-positioning of Polish
forces during the fighting, and withdrew some

00:23:23.039 --> 00:23:27.519
units from Galicia to bolster the front south
of Warsaw.

00:23:27.519 --> 00:23:33.009
The plan was to push north near Lublin, to
cut off the Bolshevik forces threatening Warsaw

00:23:33.009 --> 00:23:38.720
– the Poles didn’t know it at the time,
but this was exactly where the Red Army was

00:23:38.720 --> 00:23:40.650
weakest.

00:23:40.650 --> 00:23:42.440
But the Poles had to hurry.

00:23:42.440 --> 00:23:47.529
If Budyonni’s cavalry were to finally begin
moving west from Lwow, they could catch the

00:23:47.529 --> 00:23:52.090
Poles in the flank or rear and all would be
lost.

00:23:52.090 --> 00:23:57.369
Since Polish defences around Warsaw were holding,
Pilsudski was able to launch his daring attack

00:23:57.369 --> 00:24:03.590
on August 16, days before Budyonni finally
accepted orders to move.

00:24:03.590 --> 00:24:10.440
Tukhachevsky had learned of the preparations,
but did not believe his intelligence reports.

00:24:10.440 --> 00:24:16.960
The Polish attack was a smashing success,
despite the confusion reigning on both sides.

00:24:16.960 --> 00:24:24.379
They faced little resistance as they raced
120km into the gap and began to cut off Bolshevik

00:24:24.379 --> 00:24:27.730
lines of communication and supply.

00:24:27.730 --> 00:24:33.100
Budyonni was too far away to intervene, and
Tukhachevsky’s overextended and exhausted

00:24:33.100 --> 00:24:39.179
forces found themselves in an impossible position
– they could not take Warsaw, and they could

00:24:39.179 --> 00:24:42.950
not defend themselves with the enemy behind
them.

00:24:42.950 --> 00:24:48.730
Three Red armies were routed within the space
of a few days, and a chaotic retreat eastwards

00:24:48.730 --> 00:24:50.600
began.

00:24:50.600 --> 00:24:56.440
Supply trains and artillery were abandoned,
and Gaia Gai’s cavalry was cut off and crossed

00:24:56.440 --> 00:25:00.669
into East Prussia, where they were interned
by the Germans.

00:25:00.669 --> 00:25:05.539
As the remaining Red forces withdrew, the
Polish population that had generally refused

00:25:05.539 --> 00:25:11.919
to support them now in some cases rose up
against them, as a Red Army commissar reported:

00:25:11.919 --> 00:25:18.340
“[The locals] were extremely hostile to
us…In many cases the retreating units conducted

00:25:18.340 --> 00:25:24.659
rearguard battles with the local population,
during which the Red Army soldiers dealt brutally

00:25:24.659 --> 00:25:25.989
with the insurgents.”

00:25:25.989 --> 00:25:31.749
(Engelstein 507) He went on to note that in
Bialystok, “Even the Jewish population took

00:25:31.749 --> 00:25:33.590
part in the hostile actions.”

00:25:33.590 --> 00:25:40.000
(Engelstein 507) The Red Army had been beaten,
not only by the Polish army, but also by Polish

00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:43.369
citizens who rejected its presence.

00:25:43.369 --> 00:25:49.010
The Polish victory at Warsaw was as complete
as it was surprising, and its importance was

00:25:49.010 --> 00:25:53.299
discussed at the time, and by historians afterwards.

00:25:53.299 --> 00:26:01.090
Two thirds of Tukhachevsky’s army was killed,
wounded or captured – perhaps 100,000 men.

00:26:01.090 --> 00:26:06.820
In Catholic Poland, many felt that divine
intervention had granted them victory, and

00:26:06.820 --> 00:26:10.419
the battle became known as the Miracle on
the Vistula.

00:26:10.419 --> 00:26:17.450
Hugh Gibson, the US ambassador to Poland,
rejoiced: “The Polish news is too good to

00:26:17.450 --> 00:26:23.429
be true and if it will only continue this
way for a little time I am sure all will be

00:26:23.429 --> 00:26:24.429
well again.”

00:26:24.429 --> 00:26:30.249
(Reed 230) Viscount D’Abernon wrote a book
calling Warsaw one of the decisive battles

00:26:30.249 --> 00:26:37.000
in Western history, and the famous military
theorist JFC Fuller also included it in his

00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:39.350
list of decisive battles.

00:26:39.350 --> 00:26:45.299
On the Bolshevik side, there was now general
acceptance that peace with Poland had to be

00:26:45.299 --> 00:26:46.489
made.

00:26:46.489 --> 00:26:52.720
Lenin later reflected on what might have been:
“If Poland had become Soviet, the Versailles

00:26:52.720 --> 00:26:57.919
treaty would have been shattered, and the
entire international system built up by the

00:26:57.919 --> 00:27:00.740
victors would have been destroyed.”

00:27:00.740 --> 00:27:07.109
(Engelstein 507) Lenin blamed Stalin for the
failure, and so did Trotsky, who wrote: “If

00:27:07.109 --> 00:27:13.100
Stalin and Voroshilov and the illiterate Budyonni
had not had their own war in Galicia and the

00:27:13.100 --> 00:27:19.080
Red Cavalry had been at Lublin in time, the
Red Army would not have suffered disaster…”

00:27:19.080 --> 00:27:22.729
(Davies 211)
Regardless of individual roles, Bolshevik

00:27:22.729 --> 00:27:28.539
and Red Army command and control had clearly
failed at the critical moment, and the Polish

00:27:28.539 --> 00:27:31.119
gamble had paid off.

00:27:31.119 --> 00:27:35.619
Not only had Poland prevented a Bolshevik
conquest and perhaps stopped the spread of

00:27:35.619 --> 00:27:41.869
the revolution, but ironically the result
of the Battle of Warsaw may have had benefits

00:27:41.869 --> 00:27:44.140
for the Bolsheviks as well.

00:27:44.140 --> 00:27:49.210
If they had won, the Allies might have been
provoked into intervening and potentially

00:27:49.210 --> 00:27:50.909
overthrowing them.

00:27:50.909 --> 00:27:56.690
In the words of historian Laura Engelstein:
“Polish victory may have saved Europe from

00:27:56.690 --> 00:28:00.200
Bolshevism; it also saved Bolshevism from
Europe.”

00:28:00.200 --> 00:28:04.861
(Engelstein 510)
So by the third week of August 1920, the Poles

00:28:04.861 --> 00:28:12.049
had won a major victory, the Red Army was
on the run, and armistice talks began at Minsk.

00:28:12.049 --> 00:28:17.279
But the Polish-Soviet War was not yet over
– there would be more battles, and months

00:28:17.279 --> 00:28:22.179
of difficult and very unusual negotiations
ahead.

00:28:22.179 --> 00:28:26.729
As history creators we are facing more and
more problems talking about certain aspects

00:28:26.729 --> 00:28:28.630
of history on YouTube.

00:28:28.630 --> 00:28:35.299
Our 18 part, 5 hour long documentary series
about the Battle of Berlin wouldn’t be allowed

00:28:35.299 --> 00:28:41.080
on YouTube because it shows a part of history
that is not “advertising friendly”.

00:28:41.080 --> 00:28:48.070
So, together with other Creator friends we
teamed up to have a platform where creators

00:28:48.070 --> 00:28:55.299
don’t have to worry about demonetization
or the algorithm, where the subscribers are

00:28:55.299 --> 00:28:59.799
directly supporting the creators they watch.

00:28:59.799 --> 00:29:05.770
The content is ad-free, for example the Nebula
version of this video doesn’t feature this

00:29:05.770 --> 00:29:12.789
very ad you are watching right now.

00:29:12.789 --> 00:29:16.479
What does that have to do with CuriosityStream?

00:29:16.479 --> 00:29:23.990
Well, they like documentaries and educational
content, so they partnered with Nebula and

00:29:23.990 --> 00:29:26.370
offer you a package.

00:29:26.370 --> 00:29:32.460
If you go to curiositystream.com/thegreatwar
you can sign up for CuriosityStream and not

00:29:32.460 --> 00:29:41.570
only get access to their library of documentaries,
but you'll also get Nebula for FREE.

00:29:41.570 --> 00:29:47.279
It's not a trial, you'll have it as long as
you're a CuriosityStream member.

00:29:47.279 --> 00:29:55.510
For a limited time, CuriosityStream is offering
26% off their annual plan - that's less than

00:29:55.510 --> 00:30:01.640
$15/year for BOTH CuriosityStream and Nebula.

00:30:01.640 --> 00:30:04.429
A fantastic deal.

00:30:04.429 --> 00:30:12.070
And since virtual learning is quite important
right now, you can watch and learn about Space

00:30:12.070 --> 00:30:19.049
with astronaut Chris Hadfield or learn about
the Battle of Berlin with our documentary

00:30:19.049 --> 00:30:23.109
series 16 Days in Berlin.

00:30:23.109 --> 00:30:29.549
And when you sign up and watch, you will be
directly supporting our channel.

00:30:29.549 --> 00:30:38.379
That’s curiositystream.com/thegreatwar for
26% off.

00:30:38.379 --> 00:30:43.710

I’m Jesse Alexander and this is The Great
War 1920, a production of Real Time History

00:31:07.039 --> 00:31:12.490
and the only Youtube history channel that
asks you, if you can’t support us on Patreon,

and send us a parcel.
