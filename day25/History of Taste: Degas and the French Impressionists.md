1
00:00:02,750 --> 00:00:05,200
This painting of a beach 
scene by Degas

2
00:00:05,500 --> 00:00:08,800
is very important in the history
of the National Gallery's collection,

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,140
because it was one of the first 
French impressionist paintings

4
00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:13,700
that the Gallery ever acquired.

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,750
In this instance the National Gallery
was very much behind the times

6
00:00:17,900 --> 00:00:20,250
because for a long time 
it did not see the virtue

7
00:00:20,260 --> 00:00:21,900
of French Impressionist painting,

8
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,500
so was not avant-garde
in its collecting.

9
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:28,200
In England the taste for
French Impressionist paintings

10
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:31,750
was very much due to the efforts 
of a series of dealers.

11
00:00:31,900 --> 00:00:34,100
The Parisian dealer Durand-Ruel

12
00:00:34,100 --> 00:00:36,700
set up a gallery in 
London in 1870,

13
00:00:36,700 --> 00:00:39,000
but that actually closed
after just five years

14
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,800
because the British public didn't 
want to buy any of his French Impressionist works.

15
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,900
Other dealers carried on
his good work however.

16
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:51,300
In Scotland, in Glasgow, Alex Reid continued 
to promote the work of French Impressionists,

17
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:53,900
as did the Leicester 
Galleries in London.

18
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,900
Hugh Lane, the onetime owner
of this particular painting

19
00:00:57,950 --> 00:01:00,900
set up the Municipal Gallery
of Modern Art in Dublin,

20
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,950
where he was a restorer and  
collector of French Impressionist art,

21
00:01:04,950 --> 00:01:06,950
as well as some Old Masters,

22
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:11,800
where he showed Dubliners his wonderful 
collection of French Impressionists

23
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,060
but he wanted London to benefit
as well.

24
00:01:14,060 --> 00:01:17,900
So he contacted the Director
of the National Gallery, Charles Holroyd,

25
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,500
on two occasions at least, in 1907
and 1914,

26
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:24,800
offering to loan a group of 
his French Impressionist pictures.

27
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:26,800
Although the Director 
was very keen,

28
00:01:26,900 --> 00:01:29,500
the Trustees were quite
conservative in their tastes,

29
00:01:29,550 --> 00:01:32,900
and did not understand the point
of French Impressionist art then,

30
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:37,900
refused to show any of the pictures
in the sanctity of the National Gallery.

31
00:01:38,300 --> 00:01:40,060
Things changed, and tastes 
moved on,

32
00:01:40,550 --> 00:01:44,060
so by the time of Hugh Lane's
death in 1917,

33
00:01:44,550 --> 00:01:48,060
he `bequeathed` a group of French 
Impressionist works to the nation,

34
00:01:48,300 --> 00:01:49,900
and they were readily accepted.

35
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,600
His will was contested because 
of a unsigned codicil,

36
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:56,900
so a compromise between Dublin
and London has been reached,

37
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:02,060
whereby every few years a group of 
pictures from his bequest changes location,

38
00:02:02,060 --> 00:02:07,060
so audiences in both Dublin and London,
can enjoy the fruits of his generosity.
