00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:15.300
Including Ireland in any 

00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:19.670
discussion of ideas of Britishness is deeply
contentious

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:22.000
the result of the turbulent history of the union

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:28.010
in the 19th and 20th centuries

00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:30.339
English kings and statesman

00:00:30.339 --> 00:00:32.550
had for many centuries

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:36.170
seen Ireland as a legitimate sphere of
influence

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:42.310
as subordinate in fact to the interests
of the mainland

00:00:42.310 --> 00:00:45.120
this relationship was confirmed in the
16th century

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:51.300
when Ireland status was changed from a
separate Lordship to a puppet Kingdom

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:54.680
a possession of the English crown

00:00:54.680 --> 00:01:00.640
But it was the religious Reformation in
England the attempt to export it to Ireland

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:07.030
that was to cast a long shadow over the
history both islands

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:09.990
From the mid 16th to the mid 17th
centuries

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:13.110
successive English administration's

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:16.350
pursued a policy of settlement a
plantation

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:19.850
English and Scottish settlers

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:24.470
through their exemplary model of
civility and the true Protestant

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:26.170
religion

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:29.469
would have it was hoped a transformative
effect

00:01:29.469 --> 00:01:35.400
on the barbarous Catholic Irish

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:38.660
it was the strengthening of this
religious divide

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:43.040
between catholics on the one hand a
group that included the so called Old

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:43.660
English

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:47.770
descendants have an early wave migration

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:51.259
and more recent Protestant settlers on the other

00:01:51.259 --> 00:01:53.370
that was to become the key faultline

00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:59.829
in Irish political life during the
eighteenth century

00:01:59.829 --> 00:02:03.390
Ever since the Reformation a struggle
for power had

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:07.520
been waged between the Catholic and
Protestant elites of Irish society

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:14.020
Following the victory if we might forces
in 1691

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:18.410
the Protestant community determined to
crush the Catholic threat once and for

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:20.510
all

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:24.519
Over the next three decades legislation
was passed

00:02:24.519 --> 00:02:29.159
that was designed to severely `curtail`
the civil and religious rights

00:02:29.159 --> 00:02:35.849
of Ireland's Catholic population

00:02:35.849 --> 00:02:40.209
Many people not just Irish people believe that the British government of Ireland in the eighteenth century was harsh, 

00:02:40.209 --> 00:02:44.920
oppressive, colonial and so forth, and in certain respects it was 

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:49.329
The presence of a British army, of a British

00:02:49.329 --> 00:02:53.209
settler class reinforced by the penal
laws 

00:02:53.209 --> 00:02:57.510
which in the early eighteenth-century
excluded

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:02.420
Catholics from power almost entirely,
in theory at least almost

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:08.540
outlawed the practice in the Catholic
religion. The political relationship

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:09.930
between the two countries

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:16.639
was one of subordination. Whilst the Declaratory Act of 1720 

00:03:16.639 --> 00:03:20.840
effectively established the right at the
Westminster Parliament

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:23.980
to legislate directly for Ireland

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:28.290
British politicians also sought to manage Irish affairs 

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:34.410
through a network of elite patronage. It is
possible

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:39.129
of course to condemn the British 

00:03:39.129 --> 00:03:42.209
rule over Ireland 

00:03:42.209 --> 00:03:47.019
in the eighteenth century which was certainly harsh but two things perhaps need to be said 

00:03:47.019 --> 00:03:50.319
if not entirely to be believed. One is
that

00:03:50.319 --> 00:03:55.340
in spite of all this ferocious
legislation it was pretty patchily

00:03:55.340 --> 00:04:00.160
enforced and in effect in the last
analysis 

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:03.319
the practice of the Catholic religion
continued.

00:04:03.319 --> 00:04:06.810
I'm not sure if nobody

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:11.379
was executed for their religion but if
so

00:04:11.379 --> 00:04:16.099
it was a very rare occurrence. The other thing is this,

00:04:16.099 --> 00:04:20.010
certainly in the first half of the eighteenth century

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:23.080
nothing is more significant than the relative 

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:26.310
rural peace of Ireland. Ireland isn't

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:29.900
in flames with risings and rebellions

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:32.240
and so on

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:34.880
Ireland is no different from many European countries in

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:38.310
having a reasonably settled

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:40.840
if difficult 

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:43.370
and in many ways poverty-stricken

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:45.389
environment.

00:04:45.389 --> 00:04:48.870
Now in the second half of the eighteenth century

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:55.870
all this was to change.

00:04:56.790 --> 00:05:02.540
During the American War of Independence
with Britain overstretched abroad

00:05:02.540 --> 00:05:06.880
Protestant Patriots were able to negotiate
significant concessions 

00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:11.950
and a greater degree of autonomy for
their parliament,

00:05:11.950 --> 00:05:16.270
but it was to be the French Revolution
that was to catalyse radical opinion

00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:23.270
and provide the inspiration for the
events of 1798.

00:05:23.790 --> 00:05:28.320
Those within the Protestant tradition
had for a long time seen their Catholic

00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:28.990
neighbours

00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:35.990
as people enslaved by their church, people who couldn't be treated as common citizens. 

00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:40.910
But the revolution in France, where the
population was overthrowing the shackles 

00:05:40.910 --> 00:05:41.750
of monarchy and 

00:05:41.750 --> 00:05:46.090
papacy, seemed to a small but significant
minority

00:05:46.090 --> 00:05:49.390
Protestants to open up the possibility 

00:05:49.390 --> 00:05:53.010
of the engagement of Catholics as citizens

00:05:53.010 --> 00:06:00.010
in a secular Irish Republic. Against a
background of a wider European

00:06:02.440 --> 00:06:03.470
Enlightenment

00:06:03.470 --> 00:06:06.890
that promoted ideas of religious
toleration

00:06:06.890 --> 00:06:10.850
and with an eye on Ireland's large reserve of manpower, 

00:06:10.850 --> 00:06:14.200
potential recruits to the British
military cause,

00:06:14.200 --> 00:06:19.500
significant concessions had already been
granted to Irish Catholics 

00:06:19.500 --> 00:06:25.580
in the 1780s and nineties. Although still
excluded from Parliament

00:06:25.580 --> 00:06:30.250
and the top civil and military posts
these relief acts

00:06:30.250 --> 00:06:33.980
removed restrictions on religious
practice, education

00:06:33.980 --> 00:06:38.340
and economic activity, and restored to
Catholics the right to vote

00:06:38.340 --> 00:06:41.420
to sit on juries, to practice law

00:06:41.420 --> 00:06:44.740
and to hold military commissions and
offices under the crown. 

00:06:44.740 --> 00:06:49.190
But by the mid 1790s

00:06:49.190 --> 00:06:55.070
alarmed by the strength of the reaction
to the concessions already granted

00:06:55.070 --> 00:06:58.620
the government set out to reassure
Protestant opinion

00:06:58.620 --> 00:07:03.090
and to damp down Catholic hopes of
further gains.

00:07:03.090 --> 00:07:06.610
All the while popular disaffection
continue to grow.

00:07:06.610 --> 00:07:11.170
The demographic explosion of

00:07:11.170 --> 00:07:15.310
the second half of the century had not
been accompanied

00:07:15.310 --> 00:07:21.990
by either agriculture reform or sufficient
levels of economic growth. 

00:07:21.990 --> 00:07:24.449
Existing tensions within Irish society 

00:07:24.449 --> 00:07:27.180
have been exacerbated

00:07:27.180 --> 00:07:31.870
and rural terrorism was on the increase as
landlord sought to squeeze profits 

00:07:31.870 --> 00:07:35.670
from their Irish estates.

00:07:35.670 --> 00:07:40.650
From the summer of 1795 the
Republican United Irishmen,

00:07:40.650 --> 00:07:43.860
originally a movement for parliamentary
reform,

00:07:43.860 --> 00:07:48.669
reorganized themselves as a clandestine
organization

00:07:48.669 --> 00:07:51.930
working for an armed insurrection with
the backing of

00:07:51.930 --> 00:07:58.639
revolutionary France. They also formed an
alliance with Catholic defenders 

00:07:58.639 --> 00:08:04.330
a proletarian body inspired by
combination of Catholic sectarianism 

00:08:04.330 --> 00:08:08.100
and crude but potent aspirations to
social

00:08:08.100 --> 00:08:14.970
and political revolution. As armed raids
and assassinations multiplied 

00:08:14.970 --> 00:08:19.130
the authorities replied with increasingly
ruthless repression. 

00:08:19.130 --> 00:08:22.210
And the sense of imminent crisis

00:08:22.210 --> 00:08:27.220
also encouraged  an ever more open alliance between the forces of the state 

00:08:27.220 --> 00:08:34.220
and those of militant Protestantism. The
rebellion which finally broke out in the

00:08:35.180 --> 00:08:36.940
summer of 1798

00:08:36.940 --> 00:08:42.060
has been described as probably the most
concentrated episode of violence in 

00:08:42.060 --> 00:08:42.729
Irish history

00:08:42.729 --> 00:08:46.850
An estimated 30,000 people died in

00:08:46.850 --> 00:08:50.940
four separate outbreaks, one of which was
inspired

00:08:50.940 --> 00:08:57.940
by the belated arrival of a small French
force. In the southeast in particular 

00:08:58.140 --> 00:09:02.630
the insurrection turned into a vicious
sectarian war

00:09:02.630 --> 00:09:06.220
I think it was clear

00:09:06.220 --> 00:09:10.950
that existing arrangements namely the
existence of an Irish parliament

00:09:10.950 --> 00:09:14.460
and a relatively independent Irish
political system

00:09:14.460 --> 00:09:18.970
in the age of the French Revolution, in the age of Napoleon,

00:09:18.970 --> 00:09:22.800
wasn't enough, Ireland was running out of
control. 

00:09:22.800 --> 00:09:26.910
The existing system was no longer
working and

00:09:26.910 --> 00:09:30.750
while it might be possible after 1798
to quell the rebellion and

00:09:30.750 --> 00:09:35.490
to reassert English power of course it
could happen again. 

00:09:35.490 --> 00:09:39.510
And therefore what the rebellion 1798

00:09:39.510 --> 00:09:42.630
taught British politicians was that for 

00:09:42.630 --> 00:09:45.839
Ireland to be safe for England 

00:09:45.839 --> 00:09:50.209
and that meant not being used as a
launching pad

00:09:50.209 --> 00:09:56.030
for a French invasion of England, Ireland
could be secured by integration with England, 

00:09:56.030 --> 00:10:01.350
by Union, and that was the legitimation,
the justification

00:10:01.350 --> 00:10:07.070
for the act of union of 1801.

00:10:07.070 --> 00:10:09.230
I think the political union with Ireland

00:10:09.230 --> 00:10:13.820
in 1801 was carried out at the
`instigation` of Scots,

00:10:13.820 --> 00:10:18.540
not all Scots, but Scottish politicians
who argued that union had worked for 

00:10:18.540 --> 00:10:19.200
Scotland

00:10:19.200 --> 00:10:24.200
and that it would work for Ireland. In
retrospect we know that that's wrong 

00:10:24.200 --> 00:10:27.420
but at the time there was great confidence, 

00:10:27.420 --> 00:10:30.770
that I think reflects the confidence of
the Scottish Enlightenment, 

00:10:30.770 --> 00:10:34.500
that education, political stability,

00:10:34.500 --> 00:10:39.010
the rule of law, would mean that any
people would be able to achieve

00:10:39.010 --> 00:10:42.780
modern economic benefits

00:10:42.780 --> 00:10:46.840
and cultural progress. And I think I've
heard it observed that

00:10:46.840 --> 00:10:51.800
Enlightenment thinkers, and in
Ireland Enlightenment thinkers were

00:10:51.800 --> 00:10:57.250
confident that the linguistic and
religious

00:10:57.250 --> 00:11:01.470
divisions that were so deeply
entrenched in Irish society

00:11:01.470 --> 00:11:05.220
would inevitably pass away as a
consequence

00:11:05.220 --> 00:11:09.010
of Ireland through modernization increasing its wealth

00:11:09.010 --> 00:11:12.630
and the level of education of its
population.

00:11:12.630 --> 00:11:17.920
The british Prime Minister William Pitt

00:11:17.920 --> 00:11:21.769
had hoped that the creation of the new
United Kingdom of Great Britain and 

00:11:21.769 --> 00:11:22.420
Ireland

00:11:22.420 --> 00:11:25.730
will be accompanied by the full
emancipation of

00:11:25.730 --> 00:11:29.399
its Catholic subjects

00:11:29.399 --> 00:11:33.730
however George III having sworn to
uphold his coronation oath

00:11:33.730 --> 00:11:37.369
and the powers and prerogatives in the
Anglican Church

00:11:37.369 --> 00:11:40.999
refused to sign any such act if it was passed to him

00:11:40.999 --> 00:11:45.660
in the face of this threatened veto

00:11:45.660 --> 00:11:48.940
Pitt resigned and so was unable to
deliver

00:11:48.940 --> 00:11:54.630
on his promise of emancipation.

00:11:54.630 --> 00:11:58.230
Even in the wake at the rebellion the
act of union

00:11:58.230 --> 00:12:01.269
had actually been supported by the great
majority of

00:12:01.269 --> 00:12:05.640
propertied Catholics who believed that it would be swiftly followed

00:12:05.640 --> 00:12:08.769
by full admission to civil liberties. 

00:12:08.769 --> 00:12:14.949
The common assumption is that
following the disappointment of 1801 

00:12:14.949 --> 00:12:19.459
Catholics turned to demand the repeal of the union and

00:12:19.459 --> 00:12:24.339
for the restoration of parliamentary
independence, leaving Protestants to

00:12:24.339 --> 00:12:24.999
discover

00:12:24.999 --> 00:12:28.420
that the Union many of them had initially
opposed 

00:12:28.420 --> 00:12:33.249
was in fact their best defense against an
increasingly well-organized 

00:12:33.249 --> 00:12:38.300
and assertive Catholic majority.

00:12:38.300 --> 00:12:42.020
There can be no doubt the religion was a
major reason 

00:12:42.020 --> 00:12:45.140
for the failure of the British state

00:12:45.140 --> 00:12:48.440
to turn political control into
political integration 

00:12:48.440 --> 00:12:52.870
but it's easy with the perspective of
hindsight

00:12:52.870 --> 00:12:57.380
to conclude that the union was
necessarily doomed to failure from the

00:12:57.380 --> 00:13:01.170
start.

00:13:01.170 --> 00:13:06.840
Following the achievement of full
Catholic Emancipation in 1829

00:13:06.840 --> 00:13:10.640
the leader of the mass agitation and
future republican icon

00:13:10.640 --> 00:13:13.050
Daniel O'Connell

00:13:13.050 --> 00:13:16.459
between 1834 and 1840

00:13:16.459 --> 00:13:21.069
abandoned his demand for the repeal of
the Act of Union in favour of alliance with 

00:13:21.069 --> 00:13:21.910
the Whig Party,

00:13:21.910 --> 00:13:26.740
announcing that the people of Ireland
were prepared 

00:13:26.740 --> 00:13:33.740
if treated with justice and equity to
become a kind of west Briton

00:13:35.519 --> 00:13:37.700
Even at this point

00:13:37.700 --> 00:13:41.060
