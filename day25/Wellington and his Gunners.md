Wellington and his Gunners

1
00:00:06,810 --> 00:00:10,410
This very atmospheric painting
by Christopher Collingwood

2
00:00:10,410 --> 00:00:15,160
depicts G Troop, Royal Horse Artillery
at about five o’clock in the afternoon

3
00:00:15,160 --> 00:00:19,430
on the ridge of the Allied right-centre
of Mont Saint Jean at Waterloo.

4
00:00:19,430 --> 00:00:23,070
Three hours later, having been in action 
for a full eight hours

5
00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:25,419
and indeed in action the day prior during

6
00:00:25,419 --> 00:00:28,779
the withdrawal of Wellington’s army from 
Quatre Bras,

7
00:00:28,779 --> 00:00:32,800
the troop was all but annihilated.

8
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:38,420
And there are very few, if anybody,
who’s actually studied the Battle of Waterloo

9
00:00:38,420 --> 00:00:42,830
who would not agree with
a recent historian, Jack Weller,

10
00:00:42,830 --> 00:00:48,690
when he wrote that Wellington’s artillery
did more for him at the Battle of Waterloo

11
00:00:48,690 --> 00:00:52,010
than at any other battle.

12
00:00:52,010 --> 00:00:55,710
Yet there was one man
who didn’t agree with this,

13
00:00:55,710 --> 00:01:02,180
the very architect of that
Allied victory at Waterloo.

14
00:01:02,180 --> 00:01:09,119
The Duke of Wellington was to write to
the Master General of the Ordnance on 21 December

15
00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:12,140
from his headquarters in Paris
six months after the battle

16
00:01:12,140 --> 00:01:15,810
where he was commanding 
the Armies of Occupation.

17
00:01:15,810 --> 00:01:18,520
And he wrote that he was not actually 
very pleased

18
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:21,280
with the artillery at the Battle of Waterloo.

19
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:27,450
And he went on to make four separate accusations
in quite a lengthy letter.

20
00:01:27,450 --> 00:01:29,259
The first that they’d failed to keep a reserve;

21
00:01:29,259 --> 00:01:34,749
the second that they’d conducted counter-battery
fire, that’s firing on the French batteries;

22
00:01:34,749 --> 00:01:39,149
the third that they had not sought refuge
within (that’s a key word)

23
00:01:39,149 --> 00:01:41,740
the infantry squares during the cavalry charges

24
00:01:41,740 --> 00:01:45,619
at four o’clock to six o’clock,
the afternoon, early evening;

25
00:01:45,619 --> 00:01:54,130
and finally, the ultimate coup de grace,
the fact that they had run from the field.

26
00:01:54,130 --> 00:01:59,409
During the Battle of Waterloo,
this man here, George Wood,

27
00:01:59,409 --> 00:02:04,329
was the CRA or the Commander Royal Artillery.

28
00:02:04,329 --> 00:02:07,850
And he was a very capable artillery officer.

29
00:02:07,850 --> 00:02:11,819
But he wasn’t the officer of 
Wellington’s choice.

30
00:02:11,819 --> 00:02:17,049
And therefore it was a relationship
doomed from the outset.

31
00:02:17,049 --> 00:02:21,040
Before the mud had dried
in the fields of Mont Saint Jean,

32
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:24,590
Wood had fallen foul of Wellington
for having failed to follow up

33
00:02:24,590 --> 00:02:28,379
in the wake of the Prussian arrival
on the battlefield and to gather in

34
00:02:28,379 --> 00:02:31,900
all the abandoned French artillery.

35
00:02:31,900 --> 00:02:35,409
He was to write to a friend and colleague
of his,

36
00:02:35,409 --> 00:02:38,450
and a former CRA of Wellington’s,
Alexander Dickson,

37
00:02:38,450 --> 00:02:42,439
who’d actually just returned from
the debacle in New Orleans

38
00:02:42,439 --> 00:02:43,000
and was at the battle.

39
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,610
But he writes to Dickson,

40
00:02:44,610 --> 00:02:49,730
'My sun is set and I shall
ask leave to return to England,

41
00:02:49,730 --> 00:02:56,000
having received the most severe reprimand
before the whole staff and the servants

42
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,860
for not having brought off
the artillery taken by us...

43
00:02:59,860 --> 00:03:02,110
but more when we meet.'

44
00:03:02,110 --> 00:03:05,829
And John Fortescue, the author of that
magnificent work on

45
00:03:05,829 --> 00:03:07,360
the history of the British Army,

46
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:10,700
wrote that there can be no doubt that
no love was lost

47
00:03:10,700 --> 00:03:15,049
between the general and his Gunners.

48
00:03:15,049 --> 00:03:22,230
He went on to conclude that he found it difficult
that all the faults were one-sided.

49
00:03:22,230 --> 00:03:26,840
How was it that this relationship
reached this tipping point?

50
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:31,799
Had the Gunners really served Wellington badly
from his meteoric rise

51
00:03:31,799 --> 00:03:37,250
from the most junior lieutenant-general
in the British Army in August 1808

52
00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:45,200
through to and including his magnificent victory
at Waterloo in 1815?

53
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:49,290
In order to understand this,
we have to look at the Army itself,

54
00:03:49,290 --> 00:03:54,010
how it was structured
and how the artillery fitted into it.

55
00:03:54,010 --> 00:03:59,079
Now, a Napoleonic general had
three fighting components -

56
00:03:59,079 --> 00:04:02,980
the infantry, the cavalry and the artillery.

57
00:04:02,980 --> 00:04:05,450
The artillery was not a combat support arm.

58
00:04:05,450 --> 00:04:08,510
And interestingly enough,
I was at the School of Artillery yesterday

59
00:04:08,510 --> 00:04:12,739
and received a presentation from a young officer
who did a wonderful job,

60
00:04:12,739 --> 00:04:14,329
but of course he was under the impression

61
00:04:14,329 --> 00:04:17,940
that the artillery in the Napoleonic era
was a support arm.

62
00:04:17,940 --> 00:04:19,970
It was not, it was a fighting component.

63
00:04:19,970 --> 00:04:22,420
And the skill of a Napoleonic general

64
00:04:22,420 --> 00:04:26,900
was how he weaved those three components together
on the field of battle

65
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:31,600
to achieve his tactical and
subsequently operational objectives.

66
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:35,069
Now, this is straightforward enough,

67
00:04:35,069 --> 00:04:40,210
and yet it’s a point which quite clearly
confused Peninsular War historians.

68
00:04:40,210 --> 00:04:43,110
Not historians quite so much
who wrote about the Battle of Waterloo,

69
00:04:43,110 --> 00:04:48,220
but certainly those who covered
the Peninsular War that preceded it.

70
00:04:48,220 --> 00:04:52,100
They have tended to view the artillery,
as I say, as combat support.

71
00:04:52,100 --> 00:04:56,190
Some of them have even ignored it altogether.

72
00:04:56,190 --> 00:04:59,380
And it’s curious that French historians

73
00:04:59,380 --> 00:05:02,520
who covered the French Army 
during the Napoleonic Wars

74
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:07,770
and the French Army 
during the Revolutionary Wars

75
00:05:07,770 --> 00:05:11,060
and the Grande Armée 
during the Napoleonic Wars

76
00:05:11,060 --> 00:05:13,810
have not made the same mistake.

77
00:05:13,810 --> 00:05:18,210
But there is a fairly straightforward
series of explanations for this.

78
00:05:18,210 --> 00:05:26,430
Now, there’s no doubt the war in Iberia,
which raged from 1808 through til April 1814

79
00:05:26,430 --> 00:05:30,160
when Soult was defeated
on the outskirts of Toulouse,

80
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:35,690
was a complex and convoluted business.

81
00:05:35,690 --> 00:05:38,360
Complex too was the British recording 
of the war.

82
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:43,270
The first man to embark on this
was Robert Southey.

83
00:05:43,270 --> 00:05:49,889
Not only was Southey the poet laureate
but he was also a deep admirer of Spain.

84
00:05:49,889 --> 00:05:53,199
And this, as it happened, was his undoing,

85
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:57,949
for in his first volume of the war,
published in 1821,

86
00:05:57,949 --> 00:06:05,629
he gave far too much prominence to Spain,
its people and in particular to its military.

87
00:06:05,629 --> 00:06:09,400
This opened the door for the second protagonist,

88
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:12,590
William Napier, a veteran of
the 43rd [Regiment of Foot]

89
00:06:12,590 --> 00:06:16,669
who’d fallen on hard times and, on the
strength of two submissions

90
00:06:16,669 --> 00:06:18,259
to the Edinburgh Review,

91
00:06:18,259 --> 00:06:22,560
was asked to write a history 
of the Peninsular War.

92
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:29,110
The problem with Napier’s work is
it was both xenophobic and infantry-centric.

93
00:06:29,110 --> 00:06:35,319
He hero-worshipped Moore and Wellington
and, it could be argued, Napoleon as well.

94
00:06:35,319 --> 00:06:38,020
He was strongly influenced by the Whigs

95
00:06:38,020 --> 00:06:45,199
and he was married to the niece of the 
erstwhile Prime Minister Charles James Fox.

96
00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:50,479
These factors did not make for a happy mix.

97
00:06:50,479 --> 00:06:54,879
Many of Napier’s shortcomings, however,
were addressed in

98
00:06:54,879 --> 00:06:56,210
Sir Charles Oman’s seminal work

99
00:06:56,210 --> 00:07:00,159
on the Peninsular War in the early 20th century.

100
00:07:00,159 --> 00:07:06,340
But the contribution and the achievements
of the artillery were still largely overlooked.

101
00:07:06,340 --> 00:07:12,319
Thus, the British recording of the war
has suffered compound error

102
00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:15,099
and in the words of Andrew Roberts,
he said that

103
00:07:15,099 --> 00:07:21,389
'history might not repeat itself
but historians most certainly repeat one another'

104
00:07:21,389 --> 00:07:26,740
and that is the case with
the recording of the history and contribution

105
00:07:26,740 --> 00:07:31,740
of the Gunners during the Napoleonic Wars.

106
00:07:31,740 --> 00:07:36,750
But also the organisation of
the British Army is to blame.

107
00:07:36,750 --> 00:07:41,479
And to understand how this evolved,
we have to go back to the 17th century,

108
00:07:41,479 --> 00:07:45,560
to Oliver Cromwell and the New Model Army.

109
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:49,259
Set up, of course, by Parliament
to confront the Crown,

110
00:07:49,259 --> 00:07:51,710
which it succeeded in so doing,

111
00:07:51,710 --> 00:07:55,539
it then turns on its very creator,
Parliament itself.

112
00:07:55,539 --> 00:08:00,419
And this, in turn, led to
a constitutional antipathy

113
00:08:00,419 --> 00:08:03,909
and a deep-seated societal prejudice
against the Army

114
00:08:03,909 --> 00:08:06,889
which lasted throughout the 18th century.

115
00:08:06,889 --> 00:08:12,319
Power was vested in civil hands,
while military officers restricted themselves

116
00:08:12,319 --> 00:08:14,909
to purely professional matters.

117
00:08:14,909 --> 00:08:17,199
I accept that you cannot see -

118
00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:20,970
and I hope I don’t step too far
out of the span of these microphones,

119
00:08:20,970 --> 00:08:25,340
so if I do, just let me know that
you can’t hear what I’m saying -

120
00:08:25,340 --> 00:08:31,490
but this was the structure for command 
and administration of the British Army

121
00:08:31,490 --> 00:08:35,440
at the end of the 18th century
and the start of the Napoleonic Wars.

122
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:41,500
There were, in effect,
four completely different stovepipe areas

123
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:46,610
which had responsibility for discrete areas
of the armed forces,

124
00:08:46,610 --> 00:08:49,610
from the strategic political level
through the strategic

125
00:08:49,610 --> 00:08:53,980
to the operational and
down to the tactical level in the field.

126
00:08:53,980 --> 00:09:00,570
Just running through these from
the left-hand side of the slide

127
00:09:00,570 --> 00:09:02,250
working over to the right,

128
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:06,519
the first of these organisations
was the Treasury.

129
00:09:06,519 --> 00:09:10,250
And not surprisingly the Treasury
had responsibility for the money

130
00:09:10,250 --> 00:09:12,110
through the Paymaster General.

131
00:09:12,110 --> 00:09:17,390
But they also had responsibility for
this organisation, the Commissariat.

132
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:21,779
And so all the Army stores and
the means to transport them came under

133
00:09:21,779 --> 00:09:24,000
the Chancellor of the Exchequer.

134
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,550
Extraordinary.

135
00:09:25,550 --> 00:09:29,180
The next organisation is the War Office.

136
00:09:29,180 --> 00:09:33,630
Actually not as old as you would think,
established in the 1790s,

137
00:09:33,630 --> 00:09:40,089
and the position of the Secretary of State
for War was established in 1794.

138
00:09:40,089 --> 00:09:42,980
The problem is they were responsible
in the War Office

139
00:09:42,980 --> 00:09:47,839
for day-to-day running of the Army and
its policy and plans,

140
00:09:47,839 --> 00:09:51,740
but the Secretary of State for War
was triple hatted and

141
00:09:51,740 --> 00:09:57,839
therefore he didn’t have the time to dedicate
to looking after that day-to-day business.

142
00:09:57,839 --> 00:10:01,760
So the Secretary at War
was brought in to do that.

143
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:09,540
And this was a much older post,
established also in the 17th century.

144
00:10:09,540 --> 00:10:11,529
They had responsibility for, 
amongst other things,

145
00:10:11,529 --> 00:10:15,570
the plans and policy for matters medical.

146
00:10:15,570 --> 00:10:17,690
Now we come to Horse Guards.

147
00:10:17,690 --> 00:10:21,139
The Commander-in-Chief of the Army,
and the titular Commander-in-Chief

148
00:10:21,139 --> 00:10:25,440
for the armed forces, was of course the monarch.

149
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:30,490
In periods of crisis and war,
a dedicated Commander-in Chief

150
00:10:30,490 --> 00:10:33,290
was also appointed to Horse Guards.

151
00:10:33,290 --> 00:10:38,870
And it just so happened in 1794
that this was the King’s younger son,

152
00:10:38,870 --> 00:10:41,019
Frederick the Duke of York, 
who’d just come back

153
00:10:41,019 --> 00:10:45,060
from a failed expedition to the Low Countries.

154
00:10:45,060 --> 00:10:48,889
But the Duke of York remained in that post
throughout the Napoleonic Wars

155
00:10:48,889 --> 00:10:52,220
barring two years, 1809 and 1810,

156
00:10:52,220 --> 00:10:54,680
and did a first class job.

157
00:10:54,680 --> 00:10:59,930
But it wasn’t the Army 
because it had its arms

158
00:10:59,930 --> 00:11:02,920
around two of the three fighting components,

159
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:04,930
that is the infantry and the cavalry.

160
00:11:04,930 --> 00:11:10,260
For the third fighting component, the artillery,
came under this organisation here,

161
00:11:10,260 --> 00:11:12,620
the Board of Ordnance.

162
00:11:12,620 --> 00:11:19,889
The Board of Ordnance was set up in 1544
during the reign of Henry VIII

163
00:11:19,889 --> 00:11:25,850
and its initial role was 
to look after and procure

164
00:11:25,850 --> 00:11:29,300
cannons, guns, small arms

165
00:11:29,300 --> 00:11:32,139
and the ammunition for the Navy.

166
00:11:32,139 --> 00:11:35,790
And subsequently the Army was added.

167
00:11:35,790 --> 00:11:39,889
It also had responsibility for 
matters fortifications.

168
00:11:39,889 --> 00:11:45,100
So all the engineers, the military engineering
came under their auspices as well.

169
00:11:45,100 --> 00:11:51,570
And this included the responsibility for
the selection, the training and the appointments

170
00:11:51,570 --> 00:11:57,519
of the officers of the Royal Artillery
and the Royal Engineers.

171
00:11:57,519 --> 00:12:03,480
Its head was the Master General of the Ordnance
and by 1793 -

172
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:08,230
and you can see now there’s a pattern
as the French Revolutionary Wars kicked off,

173
00:12:08,230 --> 00:12:12,589
that the structure began to change a bit and
adapt to the situation

174
00:12:12,589 --> 00:12:14,449
the country found itself in -

175
00:12:14,449 --> 00:12:20,579
in 1793, although it’s a military man
it’s a political post.

176
00:12:20,579 --> 00:12:25,560
It of course was changed
on the fall of the government.

177
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:32,019
If we add into that this other organisation
which is the Home Office,

178
00:12:32,019 --> 00:12:34,380
because the Home Secretary 
had responsibility for

179
00:12:34,380 --> 00:12:36,980
the volunteer and the militia forces,

180
00:12:36,980 --> 00:12:39,740
you can see that actually 
you’ve now got here

181
00:12:39,740 --> 00:12:41,690
four Cabinet personnel,

182
00:12:41,690 --> 00:12:43,740
because the Board of Ordnance, 
the Master General

183
00:12:43,740 --> 00:12:46,589
was a Cabinet position.

184
00:12:46,589 --> 00:12:49,339
So we’ve got the Chancellor, 
Secretary of State for War,

185
00:12:49,339 --> 00:12:51,649
Home Secretary and 
Master General of the Ordnance

186
00:12:51,649 --> 00:12:54,820
in the Cabinet at a time when
the Cabinet only had 12 seats.

187
00:12:54,820 --> 00:12:59,220
So you can imagine how difficult
this would’ve been.

188
00:12:59,220 --> 00:13:03,899
It was almost impossible in peace-time
and ruinous in war.

189
00:13:03,899 --> 00:13:08,990
It led to divided loyalties
and absurd frustrations.

190
00:13:08,990 --> 00:13:12,490
And nowhere was this more apposite
than for the Royal Artillery

191
00:13:12,490 --> 00:13:17,190
who had to satisfy three masters -
the Master General of the Ordnance,

192
00:13:17,190 --> 00:13:22,170
the King or the C-in-C at Horse Guards 
at least,

193
00:13:22,170 --> 00:13:25,589
and of course the Commander-in-Chief 
in the field

194
00:13:25,589 --> 00:13:27,180
who was directing operations,

195
00:13:27,180 --> 00:13:31,180
who for the majority of this period
was the Duke of Wellington.

196
00:13:31,180 --> 00:13:38,480
It’s worth very quickly just looking at
the same command

197
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:41,449
and administration for the Royal Navy.

198
00:13:41,449 --> 00:13:48,410
Didn’t pose a threat to Parliament,
it is a military hierarchical wiring diagram

199
00:13:48,410 --> 00:13:51,649
that we would be very comfortable with 
even today.

200
00:13:51,649 --> 00:13:54,639
It all goes through a single conduit,
the Admiralty,

201
00:13:54,639 --> 00:13:57,029
and it’s worth noting that even 
the Board of Ordnance,

202
00:13:57,029 --> 00:13:59,360
as I said had responsibility for naval guns,

203
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:06,800
has been much more seamlessly integrated into
the naval command and control system.

204
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:10,839
What then of the performance of
the Royal Artillery during this period?

205
00:14:10,839 --> 00:14:15,029
Did they really do so badly that 
Wellington had grounds

206
00:14:15,029 --> 00:14:18,839
to be less than satisfied with them?

207
00:14:18,839 --> 00:14:25,110
It’s interesting that my study into
the artillery over this period

208
00:14:25,110 --> 00:14:32,579
has revealed that in terms of force development,
weapon development and other advances,

209
00:14:32,579 --> 00:14:38,550
they actually achieved much more than
the other two fighting components.

210
00:14:38,550 --> 00:14:42,870
They gained six battery honour titles
during the Peninsular [War]

211
00:14:42,870 --> 00:14:47,190
and another five during the Battle of Waterloo.

212
00:14:47,190 --> 00:14:53,279
They introduced the first heavy guns
into the field army,

213
00:14:53,279 --> 00:14:55,459
not in a siege train but into the field army,

214
00:14:55,459 --> 00:15:01,459
so they could move with the army and
therefore be utilised in that army

215
00:15:01,459 --> 00:15:05,160
rather than waiting for the heavy siege train
to be brought up.

216
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:07,949
They used captured French light guns -

217
00:15:07,949 --> 00:15:11,720
these are 4-pounders from the Battle of Vitoria -

218
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:17,490
and converted them for use as the first 
mounting guns during the Pyrenean campaign,

219
00:15:17,490 --> 00:15:21,630
back end of 1813-14.

220
00:15:21,630 --> 00:15:29,139
They fired the first creeping barrage
at the Siege of San Sebastian in August 1813.

221
00:15:29,139 --> 00:15:35,389
There’s no doubt that the Peninsular [War]
provided a magnificent proving ground

222
00:15:35,389 --> 00:15:41,649
for the new mobile artillery, or the 
Royal Horse Artillery as we designated it.

223
00:15:41,649 --> 00:15:46,839
They were assisted in their task by
[Sir William] Congreve Sr's

224
00:15:46,839 --> 00:15:48,339
quite excellent block trail

225
00:15:48,339 --> 00:15:54,240
which enabled the guns to have greater mobility
in a short space on the field of battle

226
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:58,740
and they were also witness to 
[Sir William] Congreve Jr's

227
00:15:58,740 --> 00:16:03,569
slightly less successful rockets.

228
00:16:03,569 --> 00:16:08,290
But undeniably the most important
of all the achievements

229
00:16:08,290 --> 00:16:12,199
was the introduction of a weapon system
which provided the Gunners,

230
00:16:12,199 --> 00:16:15,589
and therefore ipso facto the Army
and Wellington himself,

231
00:16:15,589 --> 00:16:19,290
with a force multiplier that has 
never ever received

232
00:16:19,290 --> 00:16:22,389
the recognition or approbation that it deserves.

233
00:16:22,389 --> 00:16:28,639
And I refer to Henry Shrapnel’s shell.

234
00:16:28,639 --> 00:16:30,889
This was a spherical case shot

235
00:16:30,889 --> 00:16:37,139
and it was called the Shrapnel shell in 1852
ten years after the inventor’s death.

236
00:16:37,139 --> 00:16:44,149
It enabled the artillery to fire out
to well beyond the maximum range of

237
00:16:44,149 --> 00:16:45,290
canister and grape,

238
00:16:45,290 --> 00:16:48,259
which was the other anti-personnel round
that they had,

239
00:16:48,259 --> 00:16:51,600
leaving aside a cannon ball
which of course was anti-personnel

240
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:58,259
but its chances of taking out large numbers
were greatly reduced.

241
00:16:58,259 --> 00:17:04,850
This round could fire out to 1,000 metres, which 
in terms of defeating Napoleonic infantry tactics,

242
00:17:04,850 --> 00:17:07,610
that was about the position that 
they would form up,

243
00:17:07,610 --> 00:17:09,380
where they would move forward,

244
00:17:09,380 --> 00:17:16,810
still short of canister and grape, before
they would go into their final assault formations.

245
00:17:16,810 --> 00:17:19,630
This had a devastating effect on them.

246
00:17:19,630 --> 00:17:25,510
The French did capture a Shrapnel round
in Maida in 1806

247
00:17:25,510 --> 00:17:28,940
and they spent the rest of the war
trying to replicate the fuse,

248
00:17:28,940 --> 00:17:31,790
but were unable so to do.

249
00:17:31,790 --> 00:17:38,300
By the time of the next major conflict,
that’s the Crimea (1854-55),

250
00:17:38,300 --> 00:17:41,980
every major army had Shrapnel shells 
in its arsenal

251
00:17:41,980 --> 00:17:45,160
and the British Army had lost
the force multiplication advantage

252
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:49,470
that it had with this shell.

253
00:17:49,470 --> 00:17:55,010
With such a canvas and a high level of professionalism,
it seems inconceivable therefore that

254
00:17:55,010 --> 00:17:57,050
Wellington could have been 
anything other than

255
00:17:57,050 --> 00:17:59,980
satisfied with his Gunners.

256
00:17:59,980 --> 00:18:06,950
However, as the war in the Peninsula progressed,
his criticisms of the arm waxed

257
00:18:06,950 --> 00:18:09,860
and his recognition of their achievements in

258
00:18:09,860 --> 00:18:13,910
his post-battle despatches 
most certainly waned.

259
00:18:13,910 --> 00:18:19,060
There were a number of reasons for this.

260
00:18:19,060 --> 00:18:26,130
John Fuller wrote of Wellington in 1938
that he was a believer in

261
00:18:26,130 --> 00:18:27,570
the divine right of blue blood

262
00:18:27,570 --> 00:18:34,470
and although he was an aristocrat to his fingertips,
he loathed `ostentation` and outward show.

263
00:18:34,470 --> 00:18:39,790
He possessed a profound sense of duty,
he was autocratic and dictatorial

264
00:18:39,790 --> 00:18:43,840
and was never able to suffer fools gladly.

265
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:47,530
In short, Wellington was a snob.

266
00:18:47,530 --> 00:18:54,420
He despised gratuitous advice and
he selected his close personal staff accordingly.

267
00:18:54,420 --> 00:19:00,590
His views on the lower-bred officers
of the technical services was well known

268
00:19:00,590 --> 00:19:05,730
and it was also emulated by
his close personal staff.

269
00:19:05,730 --> 00:19:09,900
Officers of the infantry and the cavalry
purchased their commissions

270
00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:12,320
whereas officers of the artillery 
and the engineers

271
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:14,900
earned them on merit.

272
00:19:14,900 --> 00:19:21,320
And Wellington considered this to be
a process open to abuse through patronage

273
00:19:21,320 --> 00:19:26,150
because his opinion was that in order to get 
into the military academy in the first place,

274
00:19:26,150 --> 00:19:28,770
you had to know someone or pay to get in.

275
00:19:28,770 --> 00:19:33,720
Of course that completely misses the point
that the whole concept of purchasing your commission

276
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:37,210
was equally subject to patronage.

277
00:19:37,210 --> 00:19:42,930
Furthermore, France had spawned
such a group of military revolutionaries

278
00:19:42,930 --> 00:19:46,300
who had no connection with property.

279
00:19:46,300 --> 00:19:54,630
And Napoleon was a gunner,
and that meant that he was right.

280
00:19:54,630 --> 00:19:59,570
Wellington was undeniably 
a difficult master to serve,

281
00:19:59,570 --> 00:20:02,710
but the Gunners must take a share of the blame

282
00:20:02,710 --> 00:20:07,130
in that many of the artillery commanders
who were sent out to the Peninsula

283
00:20:07,130 --> 00:20:10,410
were really not men that were going to
get on with Wellington.

284
00:20:10,410 --> 00:20:16,330
The responsibility for nominating those officers
fell to General John Macleod

285
00:20:16,330 --> 00:20:21,400
who was the DAG, Deputy Assistant General,
Royal Artillery based at Woolwich

286
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:25,650
and working directly to
the Master General of the Ordnance.

287
00:20:25,650 --> 00:20:29,420
The dressing down that we heard 
George Wood getting

288
00:20:29,420 --> 00:20:31,440
in the immediate aftermath of Waterloo

289
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:36,140
in front of the staff,
and quite incredibly the servants,

290
00:20:36,140 --> 00:20:38,390
really was all too familiar.

291
00:20:38,390 --> 00:20:43,870
In 1809, Wellington wrote to 
Brigadier General Howarth

292
00:20:43,870 --> 00:20:49,090
who was the first main CRA in the Peninsula,

293
00:20:49,090 --> 00:20:50,440
and he said of him that

294
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:54,000
'I shall be lucky if he does not
get me into a scrape yet'.

295
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,750
Their relationship was quite terrible.

296
00:20:56,750 --> 00:21:02,100
His replacement was a rather portly gentleman,
William Borthwick,

297
00:21:02,100 --> 00:21:07,190
who Wellington very quickly dubbed as
'the walking target'

298
00:21:07,190 --> 00:21:09,680
at the Siege of Ciudad Rodrigo.

299
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:16,120
It had been hoped that Borthwick’s arrival
would repair this rift between the Commander

300
00:21:16,120 --> 00:21:19,230
and his principal artillery adviser.

301
00:21:19,230 --> 00:21:23,640
But Captain George Jenkinson,
who was the second in command,

302
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:27,000
or battery captain as we would call him today,

303
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:33,280
of Ross’s Troop, the Chestnut Troop
now in the 1st Regiment Royal Horse Artillery,

304
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:34,180
he wrote the following.

305
00:21:34,180 --> 00:21:36,780
He said, 'My expectations of anything

306
00:21:36,780 --> 00:21:41,640
General Borthwick may effect for us
are not very sanguine

307
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:44,840
and I must confess I pity him
from the bottom of my heart

308
00:21:44,840 --> 00:21:49,390
for I am convinced that were an angel
to come down from Heaven,

309
00:21:49,390 --> 00:21:58,160
he would not please Lord W or remove from 
his mind that rancorous hatred of our corps.'

310
00:21:58,160 --> 00:22:01,540
Quite strong words.

311
00:22:01,540 --> 00:22:10,460
The next CRA was the very genteel
Lieutenant Colonel George Bull Teal Fisher.

312
00:22:10,460 --> 00:22:15,020
And he incurred Wellington’s wrath
because Wellington questioned him

313
00:22:15,020 --> 00:22:18,300
about the location of 
a number of remount horses

314
00:22:18,300 --> 00:22:19,240
for the artillery

315
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:25,600
and he said that he knew nothing about them,
at which point Wellington flew into a rage and said,

316
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:27,980
'Sir, you know nothing at all.'

317
00:22:27,980 --> 00:22:32,400
At which point Bull Teal Fisher
tendered his immediate resignation,

318
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:34,580
which was taken by Wellington.

319
00:22:34,580 --> 00:22:38,890
Fisher was a man really with
a very creative temperament

320
00:22:38,890 --> 00:22:42,580
and great artistic ability.

321
00:22:42,580 --> 00:22:45,600
He was never going to fit in with
Wellington’s band of brothers

322
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:46,860
and that was quite clear.

323
00:22:46,860 --> 00:22:49,150
He was described by one of
his fellow officers as

324
00:22:49,150 --> 00:22:56,280
'a gentleman who Nature had not added
the requisites for a rough and ready soldier'.

325
00:22:56,280 --> 00:23:02,950
But a brief word on Colonel Fisher
is that he was a magnificent artist

326
00:23:02,950 --> 00:23:07,100
and he painted a number of watercolours
while he was out there.

327
00:23:07,100 --> 00:23:08,680
And of course he was quite happy

328
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:10,490
while he was just left in Lisbon 
to paint his watercolours.

329
00:23:10,490 --> 00:23:15,240
He just didn’t want to be called forward
to join the main army in Spain.

330
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:17,220
But his watercolours are quite fantastic.

331
00:23:17,220 --> 00:23:21,520
An awful lot of them have been
exhibited in the Royal Academy.

332
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:24,700
The Foreign &amp; Commonwealth Office seem 
to have got hold of a large number of them

333
00:23:24,700 --> 00:23:27,270
and they are worth a considerable
amount of money.

334
00:23:27,270 --> 00:23:30,760
But you can quite clearly see 
the artistic temperament

335
00:23:30,760 --> 00:23:33,880
written all over his face.

336
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:38,200
Of course, appearances can be deceiving
because on the left there

337
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:40,180
we have the very brave Norman Ramsay,

338
00:23:40,180 --> 00:23:47,130
who looks more like Quentin Crisp
than the warrior that he was.

339
00:23:47,130 --> 00:23:55,060
Wellington’s verbal attacks and put downs
on his successive artillery commanders

340
00:23:55,060 --> 00:23:58,490
did actually stop when he finally gets
the man of his own choice,

341
00:23:58,490 --> 00:24:00,750
which is this man here, Alexander Dickson.

342
00:24:00,750 --> 00:24:06,060
The problem with Dickson’s elevation
is that there were four other artillery officers

343
00:24:06,060 --> 00:24:11,750
in theatre who were more senior to him
and so he was elevated above them.

344
00:24:11,750 --> 00:24:15,740
But such was Wellington’s reputation by 1813,

345
00:24:15,740 --> 00:24:17,790
post-Salamanca, prior to Vitoria,

346
00:24:17,790 --> 00:24:24,700
that even the Master General of the Ordnance
did not argue with Wellington’s decision.

347
00:24:24,700 --> 00:24:30,000
But even after he’d secured the CRA of his
own choice,

348
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:33,840
his castigation of the Gunners 
was far from over.

349
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:36,310
And a few days after the Battle of Waterloo,
of course,

350
00:24:36,310 --> 00:24:42,940
he puts Norman Ramsay under arrest
for what was quite clearly a misunderstanding.

351
00:24:42,940 --> 00:24:47,040
Lord Fitzroy Somerset, General Thomas Graham,
Lord Lyndoch

352
00:24:47,040 --> 00:24:51,520
and Alexander Dickson all appeal to Wellington
for clemency.

353
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:53,600
There was none.

354
00:24:53,600 --> 00:25:00,000
It was many weeks before Ramsay
was released from his confinement.

355
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:05,660
Ramsay dies at Waterloo
having never recovered from the humiliation

356
00:25:05,660 --> 00:25:11,330
that he suffered at the hands of
the man that he hero-worshipped.

357
00:25:11,330 --> 00:25:15,870
But it would be wrong to conclude
that Wellington made no effort

358
00:25:15,870 --> 00:25:19,730
to understand his technical arms.

359
00:25:19,730 --> 00:25:23,500
He was a great general and
he wouldn’t have been a great general

360
00:25:23,500 --> 00:25:29,560
had he not understood his fighting components
and employed them decisively on the field of battle.

361
00:25:29,560 --> 00:25:34,350
He’s often accused of 
over-exerting his influence

362
00:25:34,350 --> 00:25:36,340
on artillery matters,

363
00:25:36,340 --> 00:25:38,590
but I don’t buy this at all.

364
00:25:38,590 --> 00:25:42,450
He didn’t merely accept
his army as a fighting instrument,

365
00:25:42,450 --> 00:25:48,150
but he gauged its strengths and its limitations
and he devised his tactics accordingly.

366
00:25:48,150 --> 00:25:52,700
This applied across
the three fighting components.

367
00:25:52,700 --> 00:25:57,510
Nevertheless, there are grounds to question
whether some of his decisions

368
00:25:57,510 --> 00:26:02,100
were occasionally driven by
his animosity of the Gunners

369
00:26:02,100 --> 00:26:05,350
rather than based on
sound military judgement.

370
00:26:05,350 --> 00:26:11,460
His understanding of shrapnel shell
is a very good example.

371
00:26:11,460 --> 00:26:16,680
Following its first major operational use
at the Battle of Vimeiro,

372
00:26:16,680 --> 00:26:20,740
depicted on this slide in August 1808,

373
00:26:20,740 --> 00:26:25,180
William Robe, who was the first
CRA for those two brief engagements

374
00:26:25,180 --> 00:26:29,030
at Rolica and Vimeiro in August 1808,

375
00:26:29,030 --> 00:26:30,700
wrote to Shrapnel himself.

376
00:26:30,700 --> 00:26:31,540
And he said,

377
00:26:31,540 --> 00:26:35,580
'I have waited a few days to collect
what information I could

378
00:26:35,580 --> 00:26:38,970
as to the effects of your spherical case
in two actions

379
00:26:38,970 --> 00:26:44,760
which have taken place with the enemy
on the 17th and the 21st instant,

380
00:26:44,760 --> 00:26:48,630
and can now tell you it is admirable
to the whole army

381
00:26:48,630 --> 00:26:54,160
and I should not do my duty to the service
were I not to attribute our good fortune

382
00:26:54,160 --> 00:26:58,090
to a good use of that weapon
with which you have furnished us.

383
00:26:58,090 --> 00:27:00,020
'I told Sir A Wellesley,'

384
00:27:00,020 --> 00:27:07,810
(Arthur Wellesley, of course,
was Wellington before he took up the title)

385
00:27:07,810 --> 00:27:12,920
'I meant to write to you and
asked if it might be with his concurrence.

386
00:27:12,920 --> 00:27:17,230
His answer was,
"You may say anything you please.

387
00:27:17,230 --> 00:27:22,870
You cannot say too much for never 
was artillery fired with better effect."'

388
00:27:22,870 --> 00:27:30,810
However, this praise was relatively short-lived
for by mid-1810,

389
00:27:30,810 --> 00:27:34,640
following the attack by Masséna
and his three corps

390
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:38,590
and the Army of Portugal on the ridge
at Bussaco in September 1810,

391
00:27:38,590 --> 00:27:40,120
he was moved to write the following.

392
00:27:40,120 --> 00:27:41,450
This is Wellington writing this:

393
00:27:41,450 --> 00:27:45,540
'I saw General Simon
who was wounded by the balls of shrapnel shells

394
00:27:45,540 --> 00:27:48,580
of which he had several in his face and head.

395
00:27:48,580 --> 00:27:51,580
But they were picked out of his face
as duck shot would be

396
00:27:51,580 --> 00:27:56,230
out of the face of a person
who’d been hit by accident while out shooting

397
00:27:56,230 --> 00:27:59,160
and he was not much more
materially injured.'

398
00:27:59,160 --> 00:28:03,780
Now, Wellington didn’t stop to listen
for good technical reasons

399
00:28:03,780 --> 00:28:08,250
why if you fired shrapnel from a ridge
which is 100 metres off the valley floor

400
00:28:08,250 --> 00:28:11,610
that the effects of the weapon system
are severely reduced.

401
00:28:11,610 --> 00:28:17,570
As far as he was concerned,
he had written shrapnel off

402
00:28:17,570 --> 00:28:22,350
and he really did miss and
fail to understand and grasp

403
00:28:22,350 --> 00:28:29,020
the massive advantage that shrapnel shells
provided for the Army as a result.

404
00:28:29,020 --> 00:28:32,660
In fact, Wellington’s stormy relationship
with his Gunners

405
00:28:32,660 --> 00:28:37,160
would probably have faded from memory
had it not been for the Waterloo letter,

406
00:28:37,160 --> 00:28:41,130
which I alluded to at the beginning, written
six months after the Battle of Waterloo.

407
00:28:41,130 --> 00:28:46,460
It doesn’t come into the public domain
until 1872

408
00:28:46,460 --> 00:28:52,970
when the second Duke publishes it
as part of the supplementary letters and despatches.

409
00:28:52,970 --> 00:28:59,160
It re-opens old wounds and
rekindles the Wellington Gunner debate.

410
00:28:59,160 --> 00:29:05,750
The letter, written in response to
[Lord] Mulgrave’s enquiry, made four accusations.

411
00:29:05,750 --> 00:29:10,910
But what prompted him to write the letter
in the first instance?

412
00:29:10,910 --> 00:29:19,910
Following the battle at Vitoria in June 1813,
the Master General of the Ordnance, Lord Mulgrave,

413
00:29:19,910 --> 00:29:23,990
writes, or petitions to be more precise,
the Prince Regent

414
00:29:23,990 --> 00:29:28,250
for a pension for the artillery officers
at the Battle of Vitoria

415
00:29:28,250 --> 00:29:30,820
because they had done so well 
in recognition of

416
00:29:30,820 --> 00:29:31,950
their achievements

417
00:29:31,950 --> 00:29:35,080
and the Prince Regent duly agrees.

418
00:29:35,080 --> 00:29:39,900
The notification goes out into the field
and Wellington receives it

419
00:29:39,900 --> 00:29:44,780
and is apoplectic with rage
because he knew nothing about it.

420
00:29:44,780 --> 00:29:51,070
He feels, and I think quite rightly,
that this did nothing for force cohesion.

421
00:29:51,070 --> 00:29:55,580
And so when, after Waterloo, 
the officers this time

422
00:29:55,580 --> 00:29:58,440
write to the Master General of the Ordnance,

423
00:29:58,440 --> 00:30:00,360
still Mulgrave, and say to him,

424
00:30:00,360 --> 00:30:04,350
'Hey, how about a bit of the pension
for us following the Battle of Waterloo?'

425
00:30:04,350 --> 00:30:07,070
Mulgrave’s not quite sure how to proceed

426
00:30:07,070 --> 00:30:12,960
because at Vitoria, all the batteries
were engaged in the battle

427
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:17,670
whereas at Waterloo, a number were
dislocated out to the west

428
00:30:17,670 --> 00:30:19,220
and didn’t take part in the main battle.

429
00:30:19,220 --> 00:30:23,340
So he writes to Wellington to seek clarification
on the matter

430
00:30:23,340 --> 00:30:27,190
and Wellington is determined
to kill the idea stone dead.

431
00:30:27,190 --> 00:30:31,150
And that’s exactly what
the Waterloo letter does.

432
00:30:31,150 --> 00:30:33,960
But what of the letter itself?

433
00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:36,190
We know there are four accusations.

434
00:30:36,190 --> 00:30:40,330
The first accusation is that had he,
in other words Wellington,

435
00:30:40,330 --> 00:30:44,490
not kept a reserve at the start of the battle,
there would’ve been none left to have.

436
00:30:44,490 --> 00:30:51,760
This is a very curious accusation
because Wood and this officer, Augustus Frazer,

437
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:57,130
who was commanding the Royal Horse Artillery
and who actually was being used by Wellington

438
00:30:57,130 --> 00:31:02,440
as his principal artillery adviser
very much at the expense of Wood,

439
00:31:02,440 --> 00:31:06,770
had indeed kept a number of batteries
in reserve before the battle.

440
00:31:06,770 --> 00:31:09,860
But such was the pace of the battle
in the early stages,

441
00:31:09,860 --> 00:31:12,150
from 11 [o'clock] through to
about two [o'clock],

442
00:31:12,150 --> 00:31:16,160
that all those batteries had been used up.

443
00:31:16,160 --> 00:31:21,610
But it’s fair to say that there were
29 Allied batteries with Wellington

444
00:31:21,610 --> 00:31:25,110
at the main defensive position that day,
and in fact nine of them were in reserve

445
00:31:25,110 --> 00:31:27,640
at the start of the battle,
and that is a third.

446
00:31:27,640 --> 00:31:31,510
And that, then and now,
is about the norm for a reserve.

447
00:31:31,510 --> 00:31:36,480
So as an accusation,
there is no case to answer.

448
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:44,960
The second accusation that the batteries
had conducted counter-battery fire is true

449
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:50,920
and we have Cavalié Mercer’s rather boastful
account that he conducted this fire

450
00:31:50,920 --> 00:31:53,470
knowing that it was against
the Duke’s orders.

451
00:31:53,470 --> 00:31:57,820
There were some battery commanders who hadn’t 
been given the order properly on the day

452
00:31:57,820 --> 00:32:02,270
and that raises a number of questions
about the artillery chain of command at Waterloo,

453
00:32:02,270 --> 00:32:06,840
of which there are
a serious number of unknowns.

454
00:32:06,840 --> 00:32:10,370
We also have evidence in letters 
written to Siborne

455
00:32:10,370 --> 00:32:15,950
in the early 1830s from three other 
battery sources -

456
00:32:15,950 --> 00:32:22,590
that was Bull’s Troop, Sandham’s Company
and Bolton’s Company -

457
00:32:22,590 --> 00:32:25,380
that they’d done the same thing.

458
00:32:25,380 --> 00:32:27,670
But all of them had good mitigation.

459
00:32:27,670 --> 00:32:32,980
They were being enfiladed, that’s shot at,
by French batteries from the side

460
00:32:32,980 --> 00:32:34,580
and they needed to silence them.

461
00:32:34,580 --> 00:32:37,230
And in Bull’s case, that’s exactly what
he succeeded in doing

462
00:32:37,230 --> 00:32:40,790
with two of his howitzers that shot off
to the west

463
00:32:40,790 --> 00:32:45,780
and silenced a battery
that was enfilading his.

464
00:32:45,780 --> 00:32:49,540
But `irrespective` of whether or not
they had `mitigation`,

465
00:32:49,540 --> 00:32:51,780
this was Wellington’s order.

466
00:32:51,780 --> 00:33:01,110
And orders is orders,
and therefore it’s a fair criticism.

467
00:33:01,110 --> 00:33:04,310
Accusations three and four are linked
in that Wellington accuses the Gunners

468
00:33:04,310 --> 00:33:07,310
of not taking refuge within –
and that’s the key word –

469
00:33:07,310 --> 00:33:10,110
the infantry squares during
the cavalry attacks.

470
00:33:10,110 --> 00:33:13,890
This is from about four o’clock
to six o’clock in the evening.

471
00:33:13,890 --> 00:33:18,830
These have been `emphatically` `refuted`
by the Gunners for the last 140 years...

472
00:33:18,830 --> 00:33:22,790
140 years because of course that’s when
the letter surfaced in 1872.

473
00:33:22,790 --> 00:33:26,330
Now, the problem with taking refuge
in the squares

474
00:33:26,330 --> 00:33:29,100
was complicated by the fact that a number
of the battery commanders

475
00:33:29,100 --> 00:33:31,480
didn’t actually get the order at all.

476
00:33:31,480 --> 00:33:34,980
And there is real confusion as to
whether or not the order went out as

477
00:33:34,980 --> 00:33:36,340
'within the squares'.

478
00:33:36,340 --> 00:33:42,840
Frazer, when he writes to Siborne in the 1830s,
says it was 'within the squares',

479
00:33:42,840 --> 00:33:45,840
but then he spent a lot of the day
with Wellington.

480
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:49,610
Bloomfield on the artillery staff
says it was 'out of reach of the French cavalry',

481
00:33:49,610 --> 00:33:51,120
which is completely different,

482
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:56,220
and others were under the impression it was
'in the lee of the squares'.

483
00:33:56,220 --> 00:34:02,080
Some Gunners, Mercer being one of them,
stayed at his guns for a whole host of

484
00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:06,620
quite complicated but actually correct reasons
in the heat of the battle.

485
00:34:06,620 --> 00:34:10,159
But as far as that accusation is concerned,
it is correct.

486
00:34:10,159 --> 00:34:13,099
And I’ll say very quickly one thing,

487
00:34:13,099 --> 00:34:16,929
but we have to work out whether or not
it was a sensible order,

488
00:34:16,929 --> 00:34:18,510
because although you can’t really 
see it here,

489
00:34:18,510 --> 00:34:20,909
but you can see a square here,

490
00:34:20,909 --> 00:34:23,810
and this is not a particularly good depiction
of this square

491
00:34:23,810 --> 00:34:28,490
because if you had a battalion of 600 men
in ten companies,

492
00:34:28,490 --> 00:34:30,690
by the time they’ve formed a square
it isn’t a square,

493
00:34:30,690 --> 00:34:35,550
because four doesn’t go into ten,
so it’s more of a rectangle.

494
00:34:35,550 --> 00:34:39,480
And indeed the centre of that square
is about ten metres by ten metres.

495
00:34:39,480 --> 00:34:41,860
And if you’re trying to get
a whole battery of guns,

496
00:34:41,860 --> 00:34:45,470
that’s assuming that only one of those 
batteries is trying to get into the square,

497
00:34:45,470 --> 00:34:47,940
you’ve probably got 65 men -

498
00:34:47,940 --> 00:34:51,179
not the gun, remember
he says leave the gun.

499
00:34:51,179 --> 00:34:54,260
And if it’s a horse artillery battery,
you’ve got 65 horses as well.

500
00:34:54,260 --> 00:34:55,490
That isn’t going to go.

501
00:34:55,490 --> 00:34:58,320
And are the infantry going to open
that square at the critical moment

502
00:34:58,320 --> 00:35:02,220
while there are many thousands of
heavy French cavalry

503
00:35:02,220 --> 00:35:04,200
thundering across the valley towards them?

504
00:35:04,200 --> 00:35:06,260
I put it to you that
they probably wouldn’t.

505
00:35:06,260 --> 00:35:11,530
So, I think although the accusation is correct,
the order was fundamentally flawed.

506
00:35:11,530 --> 00:35:14,140
The accusation that the Gunners
had quit the field

507
00:35:14,140 --> 00:35:16,870
has always been vehemently rejected
by the Royal Artillery

508
00:35:16,870 --> 00:35:23,540
and yet my research has shown 
that at least one

509
00:35:23,540 --> 00:35:25,400
Royal Artillery battery most certainly did.

510
00:35:25,400 --> 00:35:29,820
And I uncovered this from histories
of the King’s German Legion

511
00:35:29,820 --> 00:35:31,460
written in Gothic script at the beginning of

512
00:35:31,460 --> 00:35:34,130
the 20th century by Bernard Schwertfeger,

513
00:35:34,130 --> 00:35:38,050
who’d used the diaries of Jacob Kuhlmann.

514
00:35:38,050 --> 00:35:43,300
Kuhlmann was commanding one of the batteries
in direct support to the 1st Division

515
00:35:43,300 --> 00:35:45,700
and [Charles] Sandham was commanding the other,

516
00:35:45,700 --> 00:35:49,490
and both those batteries
most certainly quit the field.

517
00:35:49,490 --> 00:35:54,770
Wellington will have seen them leaving and in 
Schwertfeger’s account from Jacob’s letter,

518
00:35:54,770 --> 00:35:57,880
there’s a number of other batteries
that are there as well.

519
00:35:57,880 --> 00:36:01,860
So it could be anything,
three or four or maybe more.

520
00:36:01,860 --> 00:36:05,910
Wellington almost certainly did not
see those batteries coming back.

521
00:36:05,910 --> 00:36:09,830
So, on the face of it,
the accusation is correct.

522
00:36:09,830 --> 00:36:13,570
But in fact, there was again
very good mitigation for this.

523
00:36:13,570 --> 00:36:20,020
And had Wellington had an artillery adviser
next to him that he could trust,

524
00:36:20,020 --> 00:36:24,820
in the way that Uxbridge as the cavalry commander
spent the day next to him,

525
00:36:24,820 --> 00:36:27,090
then actually this could have been explained.

526
00:36:27,090 --> 00:36:30,540
It wasn’t.

527
00:36:30,540 --> 00:36:37,930
Little doubt, therefore, that the Gunners
served Wellington well at Waterloo.

528
00:36:37,930 --> 00:36:40,690
And while the Commander-in-Chief’s motives for

529
00:36:40,690 --> 00:36:46,780
penning the letter in 1815-16 are quite clear,

530
00:36:46,780 --> 00:36:51,150
his reasons for leaving the letter
inside his official correspondence

531
00:36:51,150 --> 00:36:59,050
are less easily dismissed, because a lot of
other `contentious` letters he removed.

532
00:36:59,050 --> 00:37:04,710
There is little doubt that the relationship
between Wellington and his Gunners

533
00:37:04,710 --> 00:37:06,480
was seldom, if ever, harmonious.

534
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:10,470
And Fortescue again writes that
the quarrel between the artillery and Wellington,

535
00:37:10,470 --> 00:37:15,780
begun by his unceremonious treatment
of his senior officers in the Peninsula,

536
00:37:15,780 --> 00:37:21,700
continued by the taking away of horses from the 
batteries and giving them to the pontoon train,

537
00:37:21,700 --> 00:37:24,530
embittered by his harshness to Norman Ramsay,

538
00:37:24,530 --> 00:37:28,440
and made irreconcilable by
his despatch after Waterloo,

539
00:37:28,440 --> 00:37:32,280
renders it difficult to speak of
the relations between the two.

540
00:37:32,280 --> 00:37:37,060
There can be no doubt that no love was lost
between the general and his Gunners

541
00:37:37,060 --> 00:37:42,180
and I find it difficult to believe that
all the faults were on one side.

542
00:37:42,180 --> 00:37:44,860
Indeed, they were not one-sided.

543
00:37:44,860 --> 00:37:48,130
Wellington had to put up with
this separate chain of command

544
00:37:48,130 --> 00:37:50,350
for one of his fighting components.

545
00:37:50,350 --> 00:37:53,940
This caused not only problems
in terms of the men he received,

546
00:37:53,940 --> 00:37:57,730
but also in terms of the equipment,
the `procurement` of that equipment

547
00:37:57,730 --> 00:37:59,550
in the right type and numbers.

548
00:37:59,550 --> 00:38:02,580
He also had to put up with 
unsatisfactory officers

549
00:38:02,580 --> 00:38:04,680
sent out to command the artillery,

550
00:38:04,680 --> 00:38:11,250
and he had to quite often suffer those officers
playing both sides off against the middle.

551
00:38:11,250 --> 00:38:16,500
And, finally, he felt justifiably
that his orders were often disregarded

552
00:38:16,500 --> 00:38:19,950
or countermanded as a result of this.

553
00:38:19,950 --> 00:38:24,870
Not easy for a Commander-in-Chief in the field,
and frankly impossible

554
00:38:24,870 --> 00:38:28,050
for a man like Wellington to put up with.

555
00:38:28,050 --> 00:38:32,870
But it would be wrong to conclude
that Wellington didn’t personally achieve

556
00:38:32,870 --> 00:38:35,510
an awful lot for the Royal Artillery.

557
00:38:35,510 --> 00:38:41,070
He was largely instrumental in fostering
an all-arms integration

558
00:38:41,070 --> 00:38:43,450
between the three fighting components.

559
00:38:43,450 --> 00:38:49,780
He led on the introduction of 18-pounders,
these heavy guns, into the field army,

560
00:38:49,780 --> 00:38:53,280
the first heavy batteries 
into the British Army.

561
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:56,130
He supported the use of the 
captured French guns

562
00:38:56,130 --> 00:38:59,580
to establish the first mountain batteries,

563
00:38:59,580 --> 00:39:02,950
which had great effect
during the Pyrenean campaign.

564
00:39:02,950 --> 00:39:07,710
He was instrumental in persuading
the Board of Ordnance

565
00:39:07,710 --> 00:39:12,970
to equip the batteries with better guns,
such as the heavier 9-pounder -

566
00:39:12,970 --> 00:39:16,960
and by Waterloo nearly all the batteries
were equipped with this.

567
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:21,850
And he fought for brevet rank
for the Gunners on operations,

568
00:39:21,850 --> 00:39:27,240
and for better, more flexible promotion rules.

569
00:39:27,240 --> 00:39:31,070
It would be unfortunate 
if the concluding impression

570
00:39:31,070 --> 00:39:33,880
of this often stormy relationship

571
00:39:33,880 --> 00:39:38,910
were one where the gunner officers themselves'
dislike of their Commander-in-Chief

572
00:39:38,910 --> 00:39:42,230
was both universal and all-embracing.

573
00:39:42,230 --> 00:39:46,360
Many of the gunner officers were well aware
of the shortcomings of the Board of Ordnance

574
00:39:46,360 --> 00:39:48,580
and of their own senior offices.

575
00:39:48,580 --> 00:39:53,010
And Jenkinson again, the battery captain
of A Troop, Royal Horse Artillery,

576
00:39:53,010 --> 00:39:58,520
wrote the following account
about General Howarth, that first CRA.

577
00:39:58,520 --> 00:40:02,590
'Not one single thing will our brigadier
give us that he can possibly help.

578
00:40:02,590 --> 00:40:06,710
He repeatedly says,
"Why did you not come out here better supplied?",

579
00:40:06,710 --> 00:40:08,960
as if Ross,' (the Commander of A Troop)

580
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:14,650
'had been entrusted with the arrangement of
everything when he was ordered for the service.

581
00:40:14,650 --> 00:40:19,910
And when any wants are represented to him,
of which there may be some difficulty in supplying,

582
00:40:19,910 --> 00:40:24,180
he threatens to send the troop to Lisbon,
or to make a foot brigade of it,

583
00:40:24,180 --> 00:40:27,050
thereby hoping to quash any future representation.

584
00:40:27,050 --> 00:40:33,360
Though there is not a man who would complain
more bitterly than he would

585
00:40:33,360 --> 00:40:38,340
if any deficiency appeared
which he had not been acquainted with.'

586
00:40:38,340 --> 00:40:43,380
'In short,' finishes Jenkinson,
'he is an old woman.'

587
00:40:43,380 --> 00:40:47,190
Now that’s really strong terminology
200 years ago

588
00:40:47,190 --> 00:40:50,280
for a junior officer to be
putting pen to paper about.

589
00:40:50,280 --> 00:40:51,130
Quite revealing.

590
00:40:51,130 --> 00:40:56,340
Of the many hundreds of
gunner eye witness accounts that I read

591
00:40:56,340 --> 00:41:03,190
in the putting together of my numerous books,
but in particular of course ‘Wellington’s Guns’,

592
00:41:03,190 --> 00:41:09,130
the vast majority were very supportive
of the Duke of Wellington.

593
00:41:09,130 --> 00:41:11,280
Thank you very much.
