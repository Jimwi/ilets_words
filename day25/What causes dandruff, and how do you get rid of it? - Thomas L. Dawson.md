Here in this abundant forest,

00:00:09.579 --> 00:00:13.413
Malassezia is equipped with everything 
it could ever need.

00:00:13.413 --> 00:00:16.288
`Feasting` constantly, it’s in paradise.

00:00:16.288 --> 00:00:18.454
But wait— what’s this?

00:00:18.454 --> 00:00:23.954
In fact, Malassezia is a type of yeast 
that lives and dines

00:00:23.954 --> 00:00:26.038
on all of our scalps.

00:00:26.038 --> 00:00:31.454
And in about half of the human population,
its activity causes dandruff.

00:00:31.454 --> 00:00:35.204
So, why do some people have
more dandruff than others?

00:00:35.204 --> 00:00:37.246
And how can it be treated?

00:00:37.246 --> 00:00:41.829
We might consider ourselves individuals,
but we’re really colonies.

00:00:41.829 --> 00:00:45.162
Our skin hosts billions of microbes.

00:00:45.162 --> 00:00:51.537
Malassezia yeasts make themselves at home
on our skin shortly after we’re born.

00:00:51.537 --> 00:00:56.121
Follicles, the tiny cavities that grow
hairs all over our body,

00:00:56.121 --> 00:00:59.121
make for especially popular 
living quarters.

00:00:59.121 --> 00:01:03.787
Malassezia are fond of these hideouts
because they contain glands

00:01:03.787 --> 00:01:06.746
that secrete an oil called sebum

00:01:06.746 --> 00:01:09.913
that’s thought to lubricate 
and strengthen our hair.

00:01:09.913 --> 00:01:15.288
Malassezia evolved to consume 
our skin’s proteins and oils.

00:01:15.288 --> 00:01:18.579
And because of its many sebum-secreting 
follicles,

00:01:18.579 --> 00:01:22.788
our scalp is one of the oiliest places
on our body—

00:01:22.788 --> 00:01:25.954
and consequently, one of the yeastiest.

00:01:25.954 --> 00:01:30.371
As these fungi feast on our scalp’s oils,
dandruff may form.

00:01:30.371 --> 00:01:36.538
This is because sebum is composed of both
saturated and unsaturated fatty acids.

00:01:36.538 --> 00:01:39.246
Saturated fats neatly pack together.

00:01:39.246 --> 00:01:41.663
Unsaturated fats, on the other hand,

00:01:41.663 --> 00:01:46.663
contain double bonds that create 
an irregular kink in their structure.

00:01:46.663 --> 00:01:50.496
Malassezia eat sebum by secreting
an enzyme

00:01:50.496 --> 00:01:53.954
that releases all of the oil’s 
fatty acids.

00:01:53.954 --> 00:02:00.163
But they only consume the saturated fats,
leaving the unsaturated ones behind.

00:02:00.663 --> 00:02:05.329
These irregularly shaped leftovers 
soak into the skin

00:02:05.329 --> 00:02:10.121
and pry its barrier open,
allowing water to escape.

00:02:10.579 --> 00:02:14.954
The body detects these `breaches` 
and responds defensively,

00:02:14.954 --> 00:02:18.871
causing the inflammation 
that gives dandruff it’s itch.

00:02:18.871 --> 00:02:24.079
It also makes the skin cells proliferate
to repair the damaged barrier.

00:02:24.079 --> 00:02:27.913
Usually, our skin’s outer surface, 
or epidermis,

00:02:27.913 --> 00:02:31.204
completely renews itself 
every two to three weeks,

00:02:31.204 --> 00:02:34.788
Epidermal cells divide, 
move outwards, die,

00:02:34.788 --> 00:02:37.663
and form the skin’s tough outer layer,

00:02:37.663 --> 00:02:42.288
which gradually sheds off in single cells 
far too small to see.

00:02:42.288 --> 00:02:47.121
But with dandruff, cells churn out quickly
to correct the broken barrier,

00:02:47.121 --> 00:02:50.788
meaning they don’t mature 
and differentiate properly.

00:02:50.788 --> 00:02:55.246
Instead, they form large, `greasy` clumps
around the hair follicle

00:02:55.246 --> 00:02:58.288
that are shed as visible flakes.

00:02:58.288 --> 00:03:01.579
This is how Malassezia’s 
`voracious` appetite

00:03:01.579 --> 00:03:06.079
and our bodies reaction 
to its by-products lead to dandruff.

00:03:06.079 --> 00:03:09.163
Currently, the most effective way to get
rid of dandruff

00:03:09.163 --> 00:03:12.538
is by using antifungals 
in things like shampoos,

00:03:12.538 --> 00:03:16.413
applied directly to the scalp, 
to kill Malassezia.

00:03:16.413 --> 00:03:18.204
For those who experience dandruff,

00:03:18.204 --> 00:03:22.746
it usually comes and goes as sebum
secretions vary throughout one's lifetime

00:03:22.746 --> 00:03:24.329
due to hormonal changes.

00:03:24.329 --> 00:03:29.163
But despite the fact that Malassezia 
colonize everyone to a similar extent,

00:03:29.163 --> 00:03:31.288
not everyone gets dandruff.

00:03:31.288 --> 00:03:33.538
Some people are more susceptible.

00:03:33.538 --> 00:03:35.579
Exactly why is unclear.

00:03:35.579 --> 00:03:38.996
Do people with dandruff have a certain 
genetic predisposition?

00:03:38.996 --> 00:03:41.454
Is their skin barrier more permeable?

00:03:41.454 --> 00:03:45.788
Scientists are currently investigating 
if people with dandruff do, in fact,

00:03:45.788 --> 00:03:47.954
lose more water through their scalps,

00:03:47.954 --> 00:03:51.413
and whether this is what’s leading 
their skin cells to `proliferate`.

00:03:52.038 --> 00:03:56.371
Researchers are learning that Malassezia
communicate with our immune system

00:03:56.371 --> 00:04:02.288
using small, oily molecules called 
oxylipins that regulate inflammation.

00:04:02.288 --> 00:04:06.204
If they can find a way to inhibit
inflammatory oxylipins

00:04:06.204 --> 00:04:10.871
and boost anti-inflammatory ones, 
they could develop new treatments.

00:04:11.579 --> 00:04:16.038
Scientists are also investigating 
if there’s any benefit to our relationship

00:04:16.038 --> 00:04:17.538
with Malassezia.

00:04:17.538 --> 00:04:19.746
They hypothesize that dandruff,

00:04:19.746 --> 00:04:22.454
which can be uncomfortable
and embarrassing for us,

00:04:22.454 --> 00:04:26.246
creates a reliable, oily 
food source for the yeast.

00:04:26.246 --> 00:04:29.788
But dandruff isn’t contagious 
or a great threat to our health.

00:04:29.788 --> 00:04:34.871
And Malassezia seem to excel
at defending their territory, our skin,

00:04:34.871 --> 00:04:39.913
from other, more harmful microbes
like Staphylococcus aureus.

00:04:40.454 --> 00:04:43.996
So, while scientists have gotten 
to the bottom of many mysteries

00:04:43.996 --> 00:04:46.871
surrounding this condition,
it must be said:

00:04:46.871 --> 00:04:49.413
dandruff remains a head-scratcher.
