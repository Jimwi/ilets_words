00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:03.910
Terence Tao is one of the world's best mathematicians.

00:00:03.910 --> 00:00:10.570
He has won maths top prize, the Fields Medal,
and many would consider him a genius.

00:00:10.570 --> 00:00:15.719
His talents were recognised early, and he
was a child math prodigy.

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:19.529
He was dabbling in university courses when
he was nine.

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:23.940
And by 16, he had graduated from Flinders
University in Adelaide.

00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:24.940
By 21.

00:00:24.940 --> 00:00:27.240
He had his PhD from Princeton.

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:31.610
When Terrance was seven, he was taking some
math and physics classes at his local high

00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:32.629
school.

00:00:32.629 --> 00:00:39.190
And it was around this time that he was visited
at home by Ken Clements, a researcher of mathematically

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:40.649
gifted children.

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:46.010
This report is Clements', thoughts and findings
on Tao, including the results of a math test

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:47.010
given to him.

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:48.649
So let's take a look at it.

00:00:48.649 --> 00:00:58.219
It was the day before Terence's eighth birthday,
the 16th of July 1983, exactly 38 years ago.

00:00:58.219 --> 00:01:03.229
And it says here that Terence was given an
operations test.

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:08.479
Knowing that he might find the first few questions
too easy, Clements says 'you shouldn't laugh

00:01:08.479 --> 00:01:13.240
at the questions because they get harder towards
the end of the test.'

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:15.640
And Terrance has an interesting reply.

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:21.829
He says 'the questions won't know if I laugh
at them because they haven't got ears.'

00:01:21.829 --> 00:01:28.590
He went on to score 60 out of 60 on this test,
on average, a year 12 student taking the same

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:33.390
test would be expected to get a score of only
53 out of 60.

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:35.329
And here's one of those example questions.

00:01:35.329 --> 00:01:44.780
Question 58 asked if p divided by q divided
by r is equal to delta divided by q divided

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:47.240
by r, then find delta.

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:50.460
And here is seven year old Terence's answer.

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:56.439
He writes it out as a fraction, and then just
does a bit of algebra to rearrange for delta,

00:01:56.439 --> 00:01:59.639
getting it to be p over r squared.

00:01:59.639 --> 00:02:03.960
Although it was clear to Clements that this
test was too easy for Terrence and they'd

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:06.930
need to move on to some more difficult things.

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:11.569
This next set of questions were presented
to him, and they had to be worked out mentally.

00:02:11.569 --> 00:02:17.250
They include things like what angle does an
hour hand describe in 20 minutes?

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:23.900
Terence got all eight of these questions correct
as well, in a total time of nine minutes.

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:29.060
Clements noticed that while Terence had been
solving the questions, he often justified

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:34.790
an algebraic step by writing the appropriate
algebraic law, for example, the associative

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:36.280
law next to it.

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:40.360
And so that prompted this following very interesting
conversation.

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:45.860
Clements asked what is the associative law
for addition of real numbers, Terence answers

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:48.610
that it doesn't matter where you put the brackets.

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:53.769
He also gives a correct definition of the
commutative laws, and he also gives a correct

00:02:53.769 --> 00:02:59.290
definition of a group, something that most
math students don't encounter until university.

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:04.689
However, it seems that the first thing to
stump him was being asked what is a field.

00:03:04.689 --> 00:03:07.310
Terence replies, "I don't know".

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:11.519
Given that I `barely` have a grasp on what a
field is now, I think it's forgivable for

00:03:11.519 --> 00:03:13.970
a seven year old Terence not to know that
either.

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:19.550
He does, however, know about the distributive
law and gives the example multiplication over

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:26.770
addition, Clements asks if addition over multiplication
is an example, but Terence replies "only for

00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:28.599
Boolean algebras".

00:03:28.599 --> 00:03:33.939
Clements was quite impressed by all of this,
'not only did he have an astounding grasp

00:03:33.939 --> 00:03:39.790
of algebraic definitions for someone who was
still seven years old, but I was amazed at

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:43.420
how he used sophisticated mathematical language
freely.

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:49.330
I was beginning to form the impression that
Terence preferred to use analytic non-visual

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:53.569
methods in preference to making extensive
use of visual imagery'.

00:03:53.569 --> 00:03:59.859
Here is one of Terence's actual written solutions
to a question that says, 'The length of each

00:03:59.859 --> 00:04:02.709
side of a square is increased by three metres.

00:04:02.709 --> 00:04:09.969
The area of the new square is 39 metres squared
more than that of the original square.

00:04:09.969 --> 00:04:13.099
How long are the sides of the new square?'

00:04:13.099 --> 00:04:18.830
Terence correctly finds that the length of
the new square is eight metres.

00:04:18.830 --> 00:04:24.530
The next set of questions given to Terrance
include 'Suppose you decided to write down

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:29.420
all the numbers from one to 99,999.

00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:32.720
How many times would you have to write the
number one?'

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:37.660
This one Terrance actually gave an incorrect
solution to, although still an answer that

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:40.940
shows plenty of critical thought about the
question.

00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:44.080
Apparently the correct solution here is 50,000.

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:48.390
He struggled a little bit with a few more
of these questions.

00:04:48.390 --> 00:04:54.081
And Clements says that, 'at this stage, Terence
was showing slight signs of fatigue, although

00:04:54.081 --> 00:04:55.650
his interest was still high'.

00:04:55.650 --> 00:04:59.910
So he asked him just two more relatively simple
questions.

00:04:59.910 --> 00:05:06.480
First he asked him to sketch the graph of
y equals x squared plus x, which he did immediately,

00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:11.530
'I asked him to find the coordinates of the
turning point, and he wrote them down.

00:05:11.530 --> 00:05:14.230
This response took 20 seconds.

00:05:14.230 --> 00:05:20.490
I then asked him to sketch y is equal to x
cubed minus 2x squared plus x.

00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:24.110
And in about one minute, he produced this'.

00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:29.220
It is interesting to note that Terence hadn't
begun to study any calculus at school.

00:05:29.220 --> 00:05:36.200
But when Clements had arrived at the Tao household,
and was speaking with Terence's parents, Billy

00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:41.700
and Grace, he had spotted Terence sitting
in the far corner of the room, reading a book

00:05:41.700 --> 00:05:44.460
with the title Calculus.

00:05:44.460 --> 00:05:50.301
Terence's dad was a doctor and Terence's mum
was a graduate of physics and maths, who had

00:05:50.301 --> 00:05:52.700
worked as a high school teacher.

00:05:52.700 --> 00:05:57.980
She said that Terence liked to read mathematics
by himself, and often spent three or four

00:05:57.980 --> 00:06:01.330
hours after school reading mathematics textbooks.

00:06:01.330 --> 00:06:07.420
Terence also had an interest in computer programming,
and had taught himself BASIC language by reading

00:06:07.420 --> 00:06:08.420
a book.

00:06:08.420 --> 00:06:13.730
And at the end of this first visit, Clements
was shown one of Terence's programmes, it

00:06:13.730 --> 00:06:17.880
was called Fibonacci and actually contains
plenty of humour.

00:06:17.880 --> 00:06:22.520
Apparently, Terence wrote many of his programmes
when he was just six years old.

00:06:22.520 --> 00:06:25.380
So let's take a look at Fibonacci.

00:06:25.380 --> 00:06:27.870
It doesn't just calculate the sequence.

00:06:27.870 --> 00:06:31.430
It starts with, 'here comes Mr. Fibonacci.

00:06:31.430 --> 00:06:34.580
Can you guess which year was Mr Fibonacci
born?

00:06:34.580 --> 00:06:36.770
Write down a number please'.

00:06:36.770 --> 00:06:40.740
Then, if the user inputs the correct answer,
they can start.

00:06:40.740 --> 00:06:46.460
However, if their guess is too far off, they'll
be told 'no, he is already in heaven.

00:06:46.460 --> 00:06:47.690
Try again.'

00:06:47.690 --> 00:06:50.770
Or they might be told 'sorry, he wasn't born
yet.

00:06:50.770 --> 00:06:51.770
Try again.'

00:06:51.770 --> 00:06:56.310
Then if they were close, it would print the
difference between the guess and the actual

00:06:56.310 --> 00:07:04.160
answer, meaning that even to start this programme,
the user is guided by a bit of mathematics.

00:07:04.160 --> 00:07:09.710
After printing some of the sequence, it ends
with 'Mr. Fibonacci is leaving now'.

00:07:09.710 --> 00:07:11.590
And 'here goes his car'.

00:07:11.590 --> 00:07:16.910
This line is perhaps the only reminder of
just how young the author of this programme

00:07:16.910 --> 00:07:17.910
is.

00:07:17.910 --> 00:07:21.680
Five weeks later, Clements came back for a
second visit.

00:07:21.680 --> 00:07:25.020
And he asked Terence if something was a field.

00:07:25.020 --> 00:07:31.120
He was Terence's answer, clearly demonstrating
that since the last visit, he now knew exactly

00:07:31.120 --> 00:07:32.880
what a field was.

00:07:32.880 --> 00:07:37.340
This kind of answer is something that a university
student would be proud of.

00:07:37.340 --> 00:07:41.750
And it shows just how fast Terence was able
to learn concepts.

00:07:41.750 --> 00:07:45.410
They encountered another thing, though, that
he didn't know yet.

00:07:45.410 --> 00:07:51.310
He was asked for the antiderivative of one
over x, and responded that he had not got

00:07:51.310 --> 00:07:53.140
up to that yet in his reading.

00:07:53.140 --> 00:08:00.030
But on a third visit, not long after the second,
Terence had not only mastered the antiderivative

00:08:00.030 --> 00:08:05.490
of one over x, but was doing things like this
with partial fractions.

00:08:05.490 --> 00:08:12.540
He was given a space visualisation test, which
again made Clements come to the conclusion

00:08:12.540 --> 00:08:19.500
that Terence preferred to use non-visual analytic
methods, even if they required more complicated

00:08:19.500 --> 00:08:22.600
thinking than more visual methods.

00:08:22.600 --> 00:08:28.540
For example, with this question here, Terence
said that he checked each shape by the reflection

00:08:28.540 --> 00:08:34.189
law, which was that each point had an image
on the other side of the mediator, and he

00:08:34.189 --> 00:08:39.190
did not imagine each shape being folded along
the dotted line.

00:08:39.190 --> 00:08:44.870
Included in the report was Terence's school
timetable, the subjects marked with the asterix

00:08:44.870 --> 00:08:50.750
took place at the primary school, whilst all
the others took place at the high school.

00:08:50.750 --> 00:08:56.350
His teachers said that whilst seven year old
Terence did have the academic ability of a

00:08:56.350 --> 00:09:00.800
16 year old, his maturity was still that of
a seven year old.

00:09:00.800 --> 00:09:06.139
And Terence's parents had to balance giving
him a childhood that challenged him intellectually,

00:09:06.139 --> 00:09:11.410
but also allowed him to fit in socially and
emotionally.

00:09:11.410 --> 00:09:16.269
Report makes it clear that rather than being
pushed along one rigid track of mathematical

00:09:16.269 --> 00:09:21.510
education, Terence was allowed to pursue the
topics that interested and challenged him

00:09:21.510 --> 00:09:22.689
the most.

00:09:22.689 --> 00:09:27.630
He loved mathematics, and the efforts of those
around him were to ensure that he did not

00:09:27.630 --> 00:09:31.850
become bored or frustrated with non challenging
work.

00:09:31.850 --> 00:09:37.600
Let's finish with a look at a programme that
now eight year old Terence Tao had submitted

00:09:37.600 --> 00:09:41.870
for publication to a student mathematics journal
called Trigon.

00:09:41.870 --> 00:09:47.860
It is all about perfect numbers and is labelled
here as Terence's first published paper.

00:09:47.860 --> 00:09:53.350
'A perfect number is one such that all its
factors including one but excluding itself,

00:09:53.350 --> 00:09:55.069
add up to itself.

00:09:55.069 --> 00:10:01.709
For example, six is a perfect number because
six has factors one, two, three and six, and

00:10:01.709 --> 00:10:04.980
one plus two plus three is equal to six'.

00:10:04.980 --> 00:10:11.639
Euclid proved that a number of this form is
a perfect number, if two to the p minus one

00:10:11.639 --> 00:10:12.819
is a prime number.

00:10:12.819 --> 00:10:18.589
So Terence says that he has used this fact
to write a programme in BASIC to find perfect

00:10:18.589 --> 00:10:25.069
numbers, which starts with a programme for
checking if two to the p minus one is prime.

00:10:25.069 --> 00:10:31.120
Then he computes perfect numbers up to 10
to the 13.

00:10:31.120 --> 00:10:35.560
Yet again another example of just how outstanding
he is.

00:10:35.560 --> 00:10:38.430
It's been humbling for me to read through
these notes.

00:10:38.430 --> 00:10:43.759
I hope that it doesn't seem discouraging to
any aspiring mathematicians out there.

00:10:43.759 --> 00:10:49.269
As I'm sure Terence Tao would even agree that
many of the great mathematicians followed

00:10:49.269 --> 00:10:51.750
a more conventional path through education.

00:10:51.750 --> 00:10:53.069
Thanks for watching.

00:10:53.069 --> 00:10:55.620
