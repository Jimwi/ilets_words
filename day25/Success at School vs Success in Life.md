1
00:00:03,070 --> 00:00:08,000
We want to do well at school for an obvious
reason: because – as we’re often told

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:13,429
– it’s the primary route to doing well
at life. Few of us are in love with the A

3
00:00:13,429 --> 00:00:17,910
grades themselves – we want them because
we’re understandably interested in one day

4
00:00:17,910 --> 00:00:23,759
having a fulfilling career, a pleasant house
and the respect of others. But, sometimes,

5
00:00:23,759 --> 00:00:29,449
more often than seems entirely reassuring,
something confusing occurs: we come across

6
00:00:29,449 --> 00:00:36,460
people who triumphed at school – but flunked
at life. And vice versa. The former stars

7
00:00:36,460 --> 00:00:41,760
who once knew exactly how to satisfy their
teachers may now be flatlining in a law office,

8
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:46,949
or relocating to a provincial town in the
hope of finding something better. The path

9
00:00:46,949 --> 00:00:52,640
that seemed guaranteed to lead to success
has run into the sand. We shouldn’t actually

10
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:58,850
be surprised: school curricula are not designed
by people who necessarily have much experience

11
00:00:58,850 --> 00:01:05,000
of, or talent at, the world beyond. School
curricula are not reverse engineered from

12
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:10,850
fulfilled adult lives in the here and now.
They were intellectually influenced by all

13
00:01:10,850 --> 00:01:16,280
kinds of slightly random forces over hundreds
of years of evolution – shaped by, among

14
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:23,310
other things, the curricula of Medieval monasteries,
the ideas of some 19th-century German educationalists

15
00:01:23,310 --> 00:01:29,509
and the concerns of aristocratic court societies.
This helps to explain the many bad habits

16
00:01:29,509 --> 00:01:35,189
schools inculcate: - They suggest that the
most important things are already known; that

17
00:01:35,189 --> 00:01:42,760
what is is all that could be. They can’t
help but warn us about the dangers of originality.

18
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:47,509
- They want us to put up our hands and wait
to be asked. They want us to keep asking

19
00:01:47,509 --> 00:01:54,510
other people for permission. - They teach
us to deliver on, rather than change, expectations.

20
00:01:54,510 --> 00:02:00,310
- They teach us to redeploy ideas rather than
originate them. - They teach us to expect

21
00:02:00,310 --> 00:02:05,200
that people in authority  – rather than
letting us imagine that – in rather inspiring

22
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:09,600
ways – no one actually knows quite what’s going on. – They teach us to trust that

23
00:02:09,789 --> 00:02:16,140
They teach us everything other than the two skills that
really determine the quality of adult life;

24
00:02:16,140 --> 00:02:22,810
knowing how to choose the right job for us
and knowing how to form satisfactory relationships.

25
00:02:22,810 --> 00:02:27,890
They’ll instruct us in Latin and how to
measure the circumference of a circle long

26
00:02:27,890 --> 00:02:34,680
before they teach us those core subjects:
Work and Love. ** That said, it isn’t that

27
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:40,530
all we need to do to succeed at life is flunk
school. A good life requires us to do two

28
00:02:40,530 --> 00:02:47,060
very tricky things: be an extremely good boy
or girl for 20 years; and simultaneously never

29
00:02:47,060 --> 00:02:53,420
really believe blindly in the long-term validity
or seriousness of what we’re being asked

30
00:02:53,420 --> 00:03:00,560
to study. We need to be outwardly entirely
obedient while inwardly intelligently and

31
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:02,400
unashamedly rebellious.
