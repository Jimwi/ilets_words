00:00:07.079 --> 00:00:10.121
Fourteen Greenlands could fit in Africa,

00:00:10.121 --> 00:00:12.788
but you wouldn’t guess it
from most maps of the world.

00:00:12.788 --> 00:00:17.996
The fact is, every world map humans
have ever made is wrong.

00:00:17.996 --> 00:00:22.746
Actually, it’s impossible to make a map
of the world 100% right.

00:00:22.746 --> 00:00:25.579
No, not you, globe—
we know you’re accurate.

00:00:25.579 --> 00:00:28.704
Not you, Google Earth,
you’re just a digital globe.

00:00:28.704 --> 00:00:32.204
We're talking about flat maps, which,
let's face it,

00:00:32.204 --> 00:00:35.371
are way more convenient
for a lot of things.

00:00:35.371 --> 00:00:36.496
Anyway, as we were saying,

00:00:36.496 --> 00:00:42.079
it’s impossible to make a 100% accurate
flat map of a `spherical` planet.

00:00:42.079 --> 00:00:44.287
For a long time, people didn't even try.

00:00:44.287 --> 00:00:50.537
They just plonked places down in arbitrary
locations without any consistent scale.

00:00:50.537 --> 00:00:54.912
Then in 150 AD, the Greek mathematician
and astronomer Ptolemy

00:00:54.912 --> 00:00:57.704
systematically mapped the Earth on a grid

00:00:57.704 --> 00:01:00.912
and placed locations on the grid
according to coordinates,

00:01:00.912 --> 00:01:05.246
so maps could be checked against
others and replicated.

00:01:05.246 --> 00:01:08.746
Ptolemy built his grid out of lines
we still use today:

00:01:08.746 --> 00:01:14.079
180 lines of latitude
and 360 lines of longitude.

00:01:14.079 --> 00:01:18.413
In spite of these advances,
people kept getting lost.

00:01:18.413 --> 00:01:20.704
Part of the problem was a— shall we say—

00:01:20.704 --> 00:01:24.788
incomplete understanding
of the world’s geography.

00:01:24.788 --> 00:01:28.829
But it was also just really difficult
to navigate using a map.

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:30.829
Because the Earth is round,

00:01:30.829 --> 00:01:35.454
the shortest route from one place
to another is a path along a circle.

00:01:35.454 --> 00:01:37.579
If we draw this route on a flat map,

00:01:37.579 --> 00:01:41.663
it passes through every line of longitude
at a different angle.

00:01:41.663 --> 00:01:44.621
To follow the route,
you’d have to constantly shift

00:01:44.621 --> 00:01:47.246
the direction you're traveling.

00:01:47.246 --> 00:01:51.704
Any slight error would land
you in the wrong place.

00:01:51.704 --> 00:01:55.996
In 1569, Gerardus Mercator
fixed this problem.

00:01:55.996 --> 00:01:58.371
He created a world map proportioned

00:01:58.371 --> 00:02:02.079
so these curved navigational routes
would be straight,

00:02:02.079 --> 00:02:05.246
passing through every line
of longitude at the same angle

00:02:05.246 --> 00:02:08.704
and therefore allowing navigators
to set a constant bearing—

00:02:08.704 --> 00:02:12.871
in other words, travel in one direction—
for a whole journey.

00:02:12.871 --> 00:02:14.913
There was just one tiny hitch:

00:02:14.913 --> 00:02:18.954
to do this, he had to distort land masses
and bodies of water

00:02:18.954 --> 00:02:21.829
so those furthest
from the equator got larger

00:02:21.829 --> 00:02:24.579
and those closest
to the equator shrank.

00:02:24.579 --> 00:02:28.871
In spite of its inaccuracies, Mercator’s
map was very useful.

00:02:28.871 --> 00:02:32.913
In fact, it’s still widely used today,
including in online maps.

00:02:32.913 --> 00:02:35.829
But it’s still wrong!

00:02:35.829 --> 00:02:40.788
In 1925, the Goode Homolosine Projection
was created as— get this—

00:02:40.788 --> 00:02:45.121
an interrupted pseudo-cylindrical
equal area projection.

00:02:45.121 --> 00:02:46.996
What does that mean?
Not important.

00:02:46.996 --> 00:02:50.913
The point was to minimize
distortion for the entire world.

00:02:50.913 --> 00:02:55.121
The map can be land-oriented...
or ocean-oriented.

00:02:55.121 --> 00:03:00.538
Either way, the so-called orange peel map
isn’t very easy to read.

00:03:00.538 --> 00:03:03.913
The Dymaxion Projection by American
architect Buckminster Fuller

00:03:03.913 --> 00:03:06.121
in the 1940s is even better.

00:03:06.121 --> 00:03:07.413
Sorry,
did we say better?

00:03:07.413 --> 00:03:10.871
It’s not better if you want to understand
where things are in the world.

00:03:10.871 --> 00:03:15.163
It is better in the sense that there are
no visibly evident distortions

00:03:15.163 --> 00:03:16.829
of the land masses.

00:03:16.829 --> 00:03:21.329
Though if you wanted to know, say,
how far Brazil is from Nigeria,

00:03:21.329 --> 00:03:24.621
you won’t get any sense
of that from this map.

00:03:24.621 --> 00:03:28.038
The most accurate projection to date
is the AuthaGraph World Map

00:03:28.038 --> 00:03:32.454
designed by Japanese architect
Hajime Narukawa in 1999.

00:03:32.454 --> 00:03:35.871
The continents and oceans are almost
completely in proportion,

00:03:35.871 --> 00:03:39.204
and the map is rectangular,
just how we like it.

00:03:39.204 --> 00:03:42.329
Could this be the perfect map?

00:03:42.329 --> 00:03:43.454
Well... no.

00:03:43.454 --> 00:03:46.704
Since the Mercator works
for navigation and reads clearly,

00:03:46.704 --> 00:03:49.788
why bother with all these
whacky maps?

00:03:49.788 --> 00:03:54.163
Arno Peters argued that by enlarging
European and North American countries,

00:03:54.163 --> 00:03:57.704
the Mercator projection
gives white nations a sense of supremacy

00:03:57.704 --> 00:04:00.746
over non-white nations
closer to the equator.

00:04:00.746 --> 00:04:05.538
He adapted the Gall-Peters Projection,
which `counteracts` that particular problem,

00:04:05.538 --> 00:04:09.288
but the continents are still... stretched.

00:04:09.288 --> 00:04:11.913
Today, we rely on maps less and less
for navigation,

00:04:11.913 --> 00:04:15.538
but they still play a vital role
in education.

00:04:15.538 --> 00:04:17.579
Peters was definitely on to something:

00:04:17.579 --> 00:04:19.496
no matter what map we’re looking at,

00:04:19.496 --> 00:04:22.954
it’s a story told from the perspective
of the map’s creator

00:04:22.954 --> 00:04:27.663
that in turn shapes—perhaps unduly—
our perception of our world.

00:04:27.663 --> 00:04:29.621
Simple changes in map design,

00:04:29.621 --> 00:04:32.038
even changes that have nothing
to do with how we transfer

00:04:32.038 --> 00:04:37.371
a round Earth to a flat surface,
can completely shift our point of view.
