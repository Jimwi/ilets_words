Weaponizing Rhetoric - Ian Hill | The Open Mind

WEBVTT Kind: captions Language: en 

HEFFNER: Alexander Heffner, your host on The Open Mind. My guest today is author of the Penn State University Press volume “Advocating Weapons, War, and Terrorism: Technological and `Rhetorical` Paradox.” Ian Hill is professor of history and theory at the University of British Columbia and I wanted to start right away Ian and read from a passage of your introduction to give our viewers an overview. You write, “technologies do not kill alone and neither do people. Both technology and people depend upon each other as well as upon language, language that is violent and language that motivates violence: weapons, rhetoric, or the ways by which people argue, debate, describe, advocate and `dissent` against weapons as well as how weapons themselves motivate belief and action is such a language,” and that's what we're here to discuss. And in that context, I wanted to ask you from `the outset`, as a scholar of rhetoric and weapons, are you more concerned today about the weaponization of the rhetoric itself or the rhetoric of the weapons? 

HILL: Thank you very much for having me here. Alexander. This is, that's a great question. And it's hard to say which is which is more worrisome or not. I think these days there is a great concern for how people are using language to motivate violence and the ways that people express violent thoughts and how there's, how these violent words are being proliferated online, especially. So I think maybe these days I would say that I'm most concerned with what we might call the sort of weaponization of language especially for you know, sort of maybe information war and propagandistic purposes. 

HEFFNER: And that may be because of the nuclear `deterrent`, right? Because of where we are when it comes to recognizing that technologies have evolved to be destructive on a mass level, but we haven't experienced that massacre in some decades or even centuries, right? 

HILL: Right. And I think this is why fairly recently when Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un got into their, some sort of `saber rattling` regarding nuclear `arsenals` it was maybe a little bit `jarring` to the sort of the general population because nuclear weapons had, of course, we still have them. We still have the arsenals we're renewing the nuclear weapons as the nuclear weapons arsenal gets renewed, it happens in the background. We don't really notice about it. There's rarely even headlines or journalism about the nuclear weapons program. And so it was a reminder that nuclear weapons still exist. The deterrents might or might not still be working, but we haven't, as you say, experienced any actual nuclear attack for a very long time. 

HEFFNER: And what inspired you to write this particular book? 

HILL: Well, I'm very much interested in the ways that people tend to sort of repeat sort of patterns, linguistic practices or we tend to say very similar things over time but we forget, right, that, we've been here in the past, say with weapons in particular. And every time a new weapon is introduced there's a certain novelty to this weapon and we express ourselves in similar ways to past weapons when they appeared. But contexts have changed rights; conflicts are different and weapons become more powerful more far-reaching and more deadly. 

HEFFNER: What's your assessment of the way that we're talking about weapons today? 

HILL: Well, it's interesting. I pay a lot of attention to gun control debates. And if you've read my book, you might expect a lot of extreme `hyperbole` about the effects of weapons, say to be, guns to be `apocalyptic` rights or be especially peacemaking, like we think of the old Colt revolver was known as the peacemaker for its supposedly deterrence of violence. But I feel like now oftentimes there's a more measured assessment of the effects of guns because people know that to make hyperbolic statements about the effects of guns can lead to being attacked, right, especially online. 

HEFFNER: Well, you write about the humanization and dehumanization of weapons and the rhetoric of, of weaponry. And it's clear from the Parkland students and the activists who've been `galvanized` in recent years that they are saying that these domestic terrorist incidents are creating domestic war, a domestic warfare and are dehumanizing their peers and actually killing their peers. So in a sense, isn't it kind of a reverse, a reversal of what had been sort of a historic nostalgia for and `conversion` into a sort of humane idea of weapons and guns as if they are one of us? 

HILL: I think there's always been this sort of interplay back and forth where weapons are often so closely tied to our person. You know, sometimes, you know, on our bodies, on our hip other times more remotely, but there sort of an integral part of our technological culture. And so in that sense, they are very sort of human, or but then at this, when they're used for sort of senseless slaughter that we have difficult, a difficult time even making sense of, there is definitely this sort of dehumanizing effect, right? The, the victims of gun violence are sort of become a statistical when there are so many incidents of mass shootings. 

HEFFNER: I just wonder how you can assess the effectiveness of the anti domestic terrorism advocates, so how you would assess the rhetoric of the gun rights and safety `coalition`? 

HILL: Well, I guess the simplest way to measure effect in this particular instance would be to think about policy changes, right? So if, if dissent against guns is effective, we might be seeing more `stringent` gun control laws. We could also think about ways that anti-gun dissent might also be measured in terms of the ways that, or like, like if the National Rifle Association membership were to decrease, right, we, maybe we could say that this could be a manifestation of effective rhetoric and also just being able to maintain a public platform. So for instance many of the Parkland High School students have maintained a public presence and continue to push for gun control. And I think that's a pretty effective measure that they are in, in some way successful right; they're very good at keeping the message alive. 

HEFFNER: I also wanted to ask you here to assess the President's rhetoric because we know that this President uses words like an `authoritarian`. So the Constitution has protected us against the `bellicosity` or the `ferocity` of a would-be authoritarian's behavior. But speaking from the American perspective, this is a President who employs language like a, would-be tyrant, I like to say a wannabe authoritarian. But at the same time he's been rather measured in a not escalating armed or physical conflict around the world. And there seems to be some `incongruous` line here, not pairing up or balancing between the rhetoric `emanating` from his Twitter account and the fact that he has been rather modest in his sort of military agenda. But there's one exception to that, which is the ongoing and enormous military budget that just soaks up more billions and billions of American tax payer dollars every second, every day, every year. 

HILL: It's worrisome to think of, to think about when the rhetoric will actually mesh with military operations. 

HEFFNER: Right, 

HILL: Right. And we know that when, as a state spends a lot of money on its military, that military will be used at some points. So, it's worrisome for the future about what, what might come. As a `pacifist` I'm hoping, you know, there's always a sort of the hope that it the military budget will actually be for defense threat rather than aggression. But so thinking about the sort of the `bellicosity` and the `fear-mongering` right, that, that Trump engages in, well, maybe, and maybe it's a good sign that nothing is especially egregious has happened yet with the you know, say a new war, right, or an invasion of some of some sort. But we know that if Trump is able to sort of `rally` support for all of his other sort of hateful agendas, right, then perhaps he can `rally` support for a military endeavor. 

HEFFNER: And you said before, you think that the military spending will ultimately scale up to military involvement, so that the rhetoric and the activity do align beyond just a defensive buildup. 

HILL: Right. Well, I mean, this is sort of, our cycle right, between war and peace. And so some, sometimes we can see examples of the states that are very successful at maintaining a more defensive military posture. I'm thinking maybe specifically about, say, Japan after World War II and continuing, continuing on. But the United States has a record of continuous the military of intervention abroad. So the worry is right that even though we're still involved militarily around the world that either one of those endeavors could escalate, right or a new military endeavor or operation or war could be started. 

HEFFNER: From the perspective of those who seek harm, those who seek to undermine civil society, specifically fundamentalists. 

HILL: United States is involved in so many locations militarily there's always a danger or a fear of terrorist blowback. And so I'm definitely concerned about the capacity of any terrorist organization really to potentially rally support for further terrorist acts. And I think as propaganda becomes more and more refined and can be distributed with much more greater ease and even has the capacities to be very nuanced now, I think by sort of spreading hateful messages with a certain amount of, is not necessarily of `overt` hate, but just the indicating and pressing people to disagree with great `vehemence` right, with, not just the United States, but really this, this is a danger globally. 

HEFFNER: All right. So how, and how does the rhetoric that we're employing to combat the threat of terrorism today compare to the way that we viewed rhetoric during World War II? 

HILL: You know I think there's similarities between sort of World War II rhetoric and counterterrorism rhetoric in the sense that we can see sort of these patterns of you're dehumanizing the enemy, disparaging that of the religious or cultural backgrounds of the potential enemy. I think there's, we're concerned about using, you know, propaganda to stir up hate for other people. But this is sort of - its government's role and oftentimes the individuals who are these days on the Internet who are spreading these hateful messages. And so I think the, and that since the, there's the similarities, but then the differences are that the World War II was very concerned about `repelling`, a sort of internal enemy within Europe. And then thinking about the war in the Pacific very, the, the concerns were in geopolitical whereas oftentimes when we're talking about counter terrorism the problem is more contained within states. And we're dealing with non-state actors. And so there are differences in how we have to `frame` the enemy in order to advocate a military action. 

HEFFNER: Well, one difference is that if you listen to the joint session of Congress and Franklin D. Roosevelt responding to the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, you listened to a vigorous and sometimes populist and nationalist American advocate. For American and global security and economic rights and domestic tranquility. But you don't hear demagoguery. I mean, even in the face of that wretched act and similarly with the way President Bush responded to 9/11, there was a minimal amount of demagoguery in the rhetoric. Now you can argue with the execution of policy if there was bigotry that supplanted what was a more fair-minded and I think just rhetoric. But the difference to me now is the demagoguery because we had the Access Powers led by organizations and specifically leaders that were committed to both, to both egregious mistreatment of people, atrocity and a rhetorical `atrocity`. 

HILL: I'm not sure that, you know, demagoguery has ever really say disappeared because I, if I think of World War II, we have some, some classic `demagogues` involved with like Hitler for instance, 

HEFFNER: But not American demagogues, that's my point. 

HILL: Right. 

HEFFNER: And, and, and you know, looking internally, there may be demagoguery against the other in America now. 

HILL: Yeah. 

HEFFNER: But, but I just wonder how you assess the demagoguery then and now in the discourse. 

HILL: Yeah. Well, I think if we think about a large communication strategy right there, different participants in the communication strategy will have different roles. And so sometimes there is the, there is a role for the demagogue, right, to express hatred, right? And then at other times, maybe it's the role of the propagandist to do the same thing, right? So while Roosevelt might not have been the, sort of classic demagogue in that sense, we have American propaganda that's doing that work through you know, say, posters, for instance anti-Japanese posters or anti-German posters just do it. 

HEFFNER: But we were at war. 

HILL: Yes. Exactly right. Definitely. 

HEFFNER: And but, but how did the, how did the arms come into play here in terms of the, the use of American power to both persuade other people of our just cause and to react to the atrocities in Nazi Germany and more expansively and growing in Europe. 

HILL: Right. 

HEFFNER: Is there a way that, that, that the weapons became humanized to save liberal democracy, to aspire to save you know, freedom and liberty? 

HILL: Well, I definitely think so. And so the -- 

HEFFNER: How did that manifest? 

HILL: Yeah. The World War II example that comes to mind specifically is, you know, thinking about the bomb and, the bomb becomes sort of the what, what ends the wars according to the legend, right, with, with Japan, thereby saving innumerable American lives that, you know, so the story goes, right, if, you know, we hadn't dropped the bond, the US would've had to have invaded Japan at great cost of life. Right, so in this sense, the, the bomb sort of becomes a, a type of savior. 

HEFFNER: But what about in the act of the military war itself? Because as you point out the bomb, it's not as if it was a `foregone` conclusion that the Allied Powers would win, but the bomb wasn't the prevalent and animating force that was symbolic of the justice during the war itself. 

HILL: I'm not sure if the weapons themselves were as, especially a just or unjust. 

HEFFNER: This was carried forward through bonds, through participating in the creation of the military devices themselves on the home front. 

HILL: Yeah, definitely the sort of, the mobilization of the population during times of war, it creates a sense of solidarity and cohesiveness, right, so the factory workers who are produce producing the `munitions` have an invested interest, right in seeing a successful outcome of the war of, you know, hopefully the ending the war faster, bringing the soldiers home. And so in that sense, weapons can become in a way symbolic, right, of the entire war effort. It's, it's, it's not just the military or the government that's waging a war, but it's everyone involved in the process. 

HEFFNER: And just as a last subject, technology seems to be `outpacing` the rhetoric in that we have social media platforms where you can manipulate content to such an extent that will override the rhetoric and override the meaning of words. How do you forecast that to be impactful in the future? 

HILL: Whenever new weapons are introduced it takes a while for rhetoric to catch up. And this is actually something interesting about for instance, say technology metaphors. We tend to name metaphorically our new technologies according to our old technologies. Like if we're talking about the Internet is like the information super highway for instance, whereas a super highway is, you know, an incredibly archaic metaphor to use to describe the Internet. And so when, when new weapons do come on the scene we tend to like name them according to our older standards, but that then sort of hides the newer capabilities and innovations in the weapons technologies right? They're, you know, perhaps faster, right. Or can target a much wider area they can be more destructive, perhaps more `insidious`. But, so we have to, we have to think carefully about how we name weapons, what names people are using for weapons. And I think that's a good way to sort of peel back the rhetoric a little bit, that to understand the, the technologies more directly. 

HEFFNER: Well we can think of the names of the military projects that often try to `reiterate`, you know, what they're trying to morally accomplish and invoke patriotism. And I'm wondering if you have any specific terms or words that you think are being employed now that would interest our viewers from that, that point of view. I mean, we can think of Star Wars in the cold war era, the framing of how we identify such military programs or technological advances, especially ones that have the potential to `hamper` individual freedom, you know, that's going to be very meaningful and how the narrative evolves. 

HILL: Right. And I think there's, there's also been a trends to, to name weapons with boring names to a series of letters and numbers, right? It's calling things hypersonic, hypersonic missile or something like that, which is it's relative to go to the weapon, but maybe it doesn't quite catch our attention, like, say Star Wars does. 

HEFFNER: Or autonomous. I mean, people talk about autonomous now, right? There isn't more specificity. 

HILL: Right? And I think maybe if we started, if we as the public started naming weapons and nicknames for weapons, it could actually help us understand the weapon. 

HEFFNER: And technologies too. I mean, cookies. Like, you know, I think our viewers know that cookies has more than one meaning 

HILL: Of course, 

HEFFNER: But beyond the cookie, you know, in terms of a hyper-understanding of the technology of the Internet and the data. 

HILL: Yeah. We, these, these technologies are black-boxed, right to use that phrase. We don't understand their inner workings unless we're a technician or an expert. 

HEFFNER: And any final thought on how the public can be more savvy and aware and demanding the rhetoric and the naming and the substance that we ought to inform ourselves with. 

HILL: It's difficult, right, because weapons technologies aren't necessarily covered very much in the news. And when they are covered, often the information is very `facile`. We, we just, we just know that there is a new missile. We just know that there's a new form of a bomb. And so what's most important, I think is to, to know where the weapons are being used, right, who is being targeted and who are the victims, what injuries are being produced, who's dying and, and why. And then we're peeling back the levels of, of, you know, why we're, why there's a war in the first place or a counter terrorist operation. 

HEFFNER: Thank you Ian for your time today. Much appreciate it. 

HILL: Thank you very much, Alexander.
