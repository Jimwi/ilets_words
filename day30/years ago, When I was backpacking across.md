Years ago, When I was backpacking across western europe 

I was just outside of barcelona, hiking in the foothills of mount tibidabo.

I was at the end of this path and I came to a clearing and there was a lake, very secluded, 

There were tall trees all around, it was dead silent, gorgeous,

and Across the lake I saw a heautiful woman bathing herself,

But she was crying.
