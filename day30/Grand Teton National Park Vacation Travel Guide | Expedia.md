00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:08.800
Just a 20-minute drive from Jackson&nbsp;
Hole is Grand Teton National Park,

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:13.200
310 000 acres of Wyoming wilderness

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:29.840
that rises to some of the&nbsp;
grandest peaks in the USA.

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:38.000
Smaller and more serene than&nbsp;
neighboring Yellowstone,

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:43.040
Grand Teton’s winding rivers, mirror-like&nbsp;
lakes and jagged granite peaks

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:46.400
have long been a magnet for&nbsp;
painters and photographers,

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:48.000
and it’s easy to see why.

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:51.760
With a stark absence of foothills,

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:55.440
the contrast between the&nbsp;
flat, verdant valley floor

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:59.600
and the snow-capped Teton Range&nbsp;
makes for one of the most dramatic,

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:03.120
and memorable geological&nbsp;
statements in the Rockies.

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:12.160
The park was first established in 1929,

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:16.480
when forward-thinking local ranchers&nbsp;
and businesspeople united to

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:20.480
protect this national treasure&nbsp;
from rapidly expanding development

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:22.000
and commercial exploitation.

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:28.880
Today, the best way to enjoy Grand Teton,

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:32.720
is to buckle up and hit the 42-mile scenic loop,

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:36.000
which takes visitors on a grand&nbsp;
tour through the park’s most

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.840
awe-inspiring gifts.

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:44.320
From the southern entrance,

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:48.960
start your adventure on Highway&nbsp;
191 and work your way north,

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:53.840
where the Teton Range rises like a&nbsp;
chain of towering granite cathedrals.

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:07.840
After turning off into Antelope Flats,

00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:11.600
stretch your legs at the&nbsp;
historic district of Mormon Row.

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:16.640
Visit John Moulton Barn and T.A. Moulton Barn,

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:20.640
two of the last rustic remnants of 27 homesteads

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:24.160
built by breakaway Mormon&nbsp;
settlers in the late 1800s.

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:32.720
Long before European settlers&nbsp;
unhitched their wagons here,

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:37.120
this bountiful region was the homeland&nbsp;
of multiple Native American tribes.

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:41.360
The Shoshone people were some&nbsp;
of the most frequent visitors,

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:44.720
dwelling here in warmer months to gather food

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:49.840
and spiritual sustenance in this&nbsp;
place they call, “Many Pinnacles."

00:02:56.400 --> 00:03:01.120
As you follow the main scenic drive&nbsp;
north, you’ll come across many overlooks

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:05.200
and turnouts where you’ll&nbsp;
experience moments of such beauty,

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:07.520
they’ll stay with you for the rest of your days.

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:13.920
Join shutterbugs from all over&nbsp;
the world at Schwabacher’s Landing

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:17.840
and prepare to have your&nbsp;
breath completely taken away.

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:30.560
Once it’s returned,

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:35.920
whisper a lil’ thanks to those tireless&nbsp;
beavers who created these ponds

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:38.640
which reflect the Tetons in all their glory.

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:43.600
A little further on, at the Snake River Overlook,

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:49.280
get a bird’s eye view of the waters&nbsp;
that began as three small streams in

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:51.120
nearby Yellowstone National Park.

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:56.160
Then, continue north to Oxbow Bend,

00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:59.040
and get a closer view of this liquid canvas

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:04.000
as it slips towards the Columbia River,&nbsp;
and the wide blue Pacific beyond.

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:12.080
Just up the road, pull into Colter Bay,

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:17.600
perched on the stunning shores of the&nbsp;
park’s big blue heart, Jackson Lake.

00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:26.000
This 15-mile glacial lake stretches along&nbsp;
the base of the northern Teton range,

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.880
and is one of the highest&nbsp;
altitude lakes in the US.

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:36.080
Spend a day cruising the calm&nbsp;
water and visiting its islands…

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:42.720
while from its banks, fish for trout&nbsp;
or explore miles upon miles of trails.

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:52.560
From the lake, take the short&nbsp;
drive up Signal Mountain.

00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:58.080
After a 15-minute climb through stands&nbsp;
of conifers, emerge at the lookout,

00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:01.840
where stretched out below you, the park’s streams,

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:09.840
meadows and saw-toothed spires come&nbsp;
together in a sublime visual symphony.

00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:14.560
After taking in the views from Signal Mountain,

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:18.000
head south to the Jenny Lake Road scenic drive,

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:21.040
which offers overlooks to&nbsp;
even more eye-popping vistas.

00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:26.480
If you’re looking for the perfect&nbsp;
place to kick back for a few days,

00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:30.480
Jenny Lake offers plenty of&nbsp;
camping and lodging options,

00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:37.840
as well as every lakeside activity imaginable.

00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:43.680
Learn about the lake’s&nbsp;
geological and natural history

00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:45.600
at the Jenny Lake Visitor Centre.

00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:50.400
Then lace up your hiking boots and&nbsp;
spend a day on the Jenny Lake trail,

00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:53.200
which circles Grand Teton’s deepest lake.

00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:05.760
If you’re short on time, climb aboard the ferry,

00:06:05.760 --> 00:06:08.240
which crosses to the western shore every

00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:10.800
15 minutes to two of the trail’s highlights.

00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:20.000
Follow the sound of cascading&nbsp;
water ever-upward to Hidden Falls.

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:24.080
Then a half-mile on, stretch&nbsp;
out on the sun-warmed granite

00:06:24.080 --> 00:06:33.840
and take in the sweeping&nbsp;
views from Inspiration Point.

00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:39.360
After soaking up the sights of Jenny Lake,

00:06:39.360 --> 00:06:44.400
continue south along the inner park&nbsp;
loop to the Teton Glacier Turnout,

00:06:44.400 --> 00:06:47.840
and get uninterrupted views&nbsp;
of the park’s largest glacier.

00:06:59.360 --> 00:07:03.200
Then, for a final stop on&nbsp;
your Grand Teton road trip,

00:07:03.200 --> 00:07:06.800
take the easy one-and-a-half-mile&nbsp;
hike to Taggart Lake.

00:07:08.080 --> 00:07:12.320
Along the way, say farewell to&nbsp;
those ever-present towering peaks

00:07:12.320 --> 00:07:15.840
which by now have become&nbsp;
as familiar as old friends.

00:07:22.640 --> 00:07:25.760
Most great journeys eventually come to an end,

00:07:25.760 --> 00:07:29.040
but this is not one of those journeys.

00:07:29.040 --> 00:07:33.760
Once you’ve left this wild corner of&nbsp;
Wyoming, the `grandeur` of these `meadows`,

00:07:34.320 --> 00:07:40.480
lakes, rivers and peaks will revisit&nbsp;
you when and where you least expect it.

00:07:41.200 --> 00:07:45.680
For once you’ve gazed into the&nbsp;
mirrors of Grand Teton National Park,

00:07:46.240 --> 00:07:57.840
her reflections will gently ripple&nbsp;
through your memory, for a lifetime.
