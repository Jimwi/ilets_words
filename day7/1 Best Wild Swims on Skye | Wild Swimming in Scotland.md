Best Wild Swims on Skye | Wild Swimming in Scotland 

Many people say `the Isle of Skye` is the most beautiful part of Scotland, and it’s also a wild swimmer’s wet dream! 

Might want to take a wetsuit though… it's `baltic`! This is the Allt Daraich, near Sligachan. A beautiful set of river pools, with something for everyone.You can chill out in the calm, clear water, there’s some fun jumps and some mad `bastard` jumps and all! Nope! 

Try and find where the river has made like a natural bathtub in the rock - it kind of looks like a jacuzzi. More of a cold tub than a hot tub though! Now not many people know about this place - so why am I telling you? It’s cos in September 2016 I lost my favourite pair of `goggles` in these pools. So if you find them, gies a shout! 

See water, shall swim! That’s pretty much my `motto` and if it’s salt you’re after, the only way is Talisker Bay! Come here at sunset, it is amazing! You get this awesome light out to sea, and across the black and grey sand beach it shows up beautifully. Swim out to get a different view of this awesome place and if you’re lucky, you might catch some waves. And if you’re even luckier, you might find the underwater camera I lost here in October 2015. If you do, please get in touch. You are now covered in salt, you are dirty, you need a wash! Come to the `mighty` waterfall at Lealt. At the bottom of the `gorge` there’s this awesome pool with some amazing jumping. And some creepy things to be found, just beneath the surface… Oh and in April 2015, I lost my favourite jacket here. `It was yellow and blue`, it made me look like one of those minions off of Despicable Me. So if you find it, you know where I am. 

I couldn’t leave out the famous Fairy Pools, sitting right under the `Cuillin`. There’s a reason that this place in summer, is as busy as Sauchiehall Street on a Saturday. The pools are `stunning`, they are way over-hyped though and they’re hoora cold all year round! Now you wanna come first light in the day to avoid all the punters getting their Instagram photos. You just don’t know where they’re pointing that zoom lens…Check out the crystal clear water, and if you’re hard enough to handle the cold, the best bit is a dive under an amazing natural arch that takes you from one pool to another. In April 2011 I lost a pair of boxer shorts here. So if you find them... chuck them out, I don’t want them now!
