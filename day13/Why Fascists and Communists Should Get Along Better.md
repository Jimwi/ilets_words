Why Fascists and Communists Should Get Along Better 

WEBVTT Kind: captions Language: en 

When you're trying to diagnose the ills of society it's hard to know if you're isolating a symptom or a cause and in the case of what I'm going to be talking about in this video I think it's both but as a symptom it's extremely concerning and if allowed to continue it could be really hard to pull back from. Any `proliferation` of fascism or Nazism is something that most people would find concerning but what should be just as concerning is the growth of socialist or communist extremism which for some reason doesn't carry the same `stigma` and I think that's one of the first things that we have to `confront` if we're gonna be honest about facing the problem of `extremism`. We can't `denounce` just one version of it while being lenient of another. I think there are many reasons why communism hasn't been as aggressively denounced as fascism but one that stands out for me is that communism has never had to undergo its own Nuremberg trials. Now the Nuremberg trials were military tribunals the Allies used to `prosecute` the leaders of Nazi Germany for crimes against humanity. It was an opportunity for the entire world to get a full disclosure of the horrific actions of that pathological ideology. It stripped Nazism of the pomp and glamor of its political rallies and reduced it to its core ideals of `supremacy`, oppression, `imperialism`, and `genocide`. It was an utter humiliation for the people that installed and enable that political disorder to `devastate` the lives of untold millions. The defeat of the Nazi regime and the subsequent `denunciation` of its leaders through the Nuremberg trials created such a stigma for this `repulsive` creed that only the most isolated people would dare to promote it in public. But communism hasn't suffered that same stigma. For example when I visited Berlin at the site of the Berlin Wall I discovered that you could buy hammer and sickle emblazoned t-shirts at the very spot where innocent people were gunned down trying to escape the oppressive regime that that symbol represents. But you would be hard-pressed to find t-shirts with fascist symbols `emblazoned` on them in shops anywhere let alone at popular tourist destinations. Communism has never had to face its Nuremberg `humiliation` but that's not for a lack of evidence that should persuade any reasonable person of goodwill to hold it in similar `contempt`. Communist regimes, leaders, and thinkers are responsible for more deaths, either through `willful` incompetence or `deliberate` oppression, than any other political framework in human history and we celebrate it in tourist shops as if it's a harmless `novelty`. So when so-called anti-fascist groups like an Antifa characterized themselves as being merely opposed to fascism and nothing else, I get a little `vexed` because even a casual glance in their direction reveals that they're actually a militant communist gang presenting themselves as the essential solution to fascism. For a little historical context, Antifa was founded by the German Communist Party which was running against Hitler's National Socialist Party in the early 1930s. Now the Nazis employed a gang of `thugs` who were famously known as the brown shirts to intimidate German voters in order to support them in the election. Unsurprisingly the German Communist Party employed the same tactics and that's where we get an Antifa from. They're the communist equivalent of Hitler's brown shirts. But if their only `mandate` is to oppose fascism then what's the problem right? Well the problem is that they have a very broad and loosely defined understanding of what fascism is. That's why they aggressively protested events like Ben Shapiro speaking at UC Berkeley. If they can label someone like Ben Shapiro, an Orthodox Jew, as a Nazi fascist then virtually anyone is at risk of similar `condemnation`. Dartmouth visiting scholar Marc Bray who wrote the Anti-Fascist Handbook was recently asked at one of the speaking engagements where he was promoting his book how a person avoids being labeled a fascist so as to avoid the violent `reprisals` he was defending in his speech and in his book. His response was to admit that defining a fascist was really difficult and then he went on to not answer the question or provide any objective criteria that categorizes a person as a fascist. It's worth noting too that defenders of Antifa violence like Marc Bray justify their stance based on the `premise` that fascist activity is now a `prolific` danger, especially in countries like the United States, but if that were true you'd think that his speaking tour, promoting his ideals of violence against anyone that fits his loose understanding of fascism, would have faced some seriously violent opposition from the fascists that are so prevalent. But he didn't and in fact I couldn't find any news reports that said that there was any kind of protest against his violent `espousals`. And yet speakers like Jordan Peterson and Ben Shapiro have had to endure constant `antagonistic` protests from groups like an Antifa so who exactly is it that we should be worried about? Now this `hostility` between communists and fascists has always been kind of `bewildering` to me because even though they will insist that they are `diametrically` opposed to each other even a cursory understanding of these two political doctrines and the historical implementation of them will `poke` some pretty big holes in that `assertion`. And that's weird because we've always been taught that they are polar opposites. Fascism on the extreme right and Communism on the extreme left but polar opposites don't tend to agree on as many things as socialism and fascism do. Like with any other spectrum that we know of, if you take whatever exists at opposite ends of that spectrum, what you should find is a `dichotomy` that has absolutely nothing in common. So for example, take the grayscale spectrum - on opposite ends you have black and white and these two colors or `intensities` of light have nothing in common with each other. White reflects all light and black absorbs all light. Similarly if communism and fascism were truly polar opposites, we shouldn't be able to find anything in common between them but what we do find is that they have quite a lot in common, including: With so much in common you'd think that they'd have more reasons to just get along. Setting aside the tongue-in-cheek for a second, this is actually a serious `symptom` if you're trying to diagnose the health of a society. Whenever extremist political ideologies like these have gained momentum, historically, it has been because of some growing `infirmity` in society. Now my guess is the number of people who are turning to extremist political ideologies is still a small minority. but what is so alarming is that even with so little support, look at the amount of attention they demand and the amount of disruption they can cause. And so we're `distracted` from the things that we should be focusing on and it creates a climate of fear which `exacerbates` the reasons that people are becoming so polarized to begin with. Prosperity of the middle class is what has always kept this kind of thing at the `fringe` but with growing political corruption and crony capitalism people are starting to get `screwed` and out of their poverty they are turning to extremism for an answer. So what's the solution? Fix the system! Create a more just economy, restore confidence in the media and other forms of accountability, and put your iPhone down for long enough to hear your own thoughts rather than this `hysterical` feedback loop that we all seem to be stuck in. Go outside, have a real conversation with a person or two and look them in the eye when you speak to them and resolve to make whatever personal improvements you need to make to interrupt the advancement of this `poisonous` disease.
