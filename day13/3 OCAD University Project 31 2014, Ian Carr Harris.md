[Ian Carr-Harris] My route to becoming an artist was a little bit `circuitous` because I started off by, uh, studying modern history. I became `enthralled` when I was studying history uh, by the um, uh debate between whether one looked at history as a series of structural phenomena or whether you looked at it as a series of very human events. Uh, I liked history a lot for both those reasons but, uh, I found myself increasingly `captivated` by the physicality of history, how, when you thought about it, these things are real events that people went through. One of the reasons I actually decided not to continue in history, but to shift over to what I always did privately, which was to draw and uh, make little `sculptures` and stuff, so long story short, I ended up, uh, `switching` over to art. Went to OCAD, well OCA of course at that time, So I did sculpture. I think it was probably '68 to '71. 

[Susan Hobbs] Yeah I think if I look back on it I mean I was aware of Ian Carr-Harris's work probably since the time I was a student. Some artists that change constantly and it appears inconsistent and Ian has, has, the work has changed but it's remained very consistent within the, within his interests in his vocabulary and, uh, so that to me it's all "Ian Carr-Harris work," although it's not `repititious`. Text and and history and, uh, how, how we look at things, how we um, interact with those objects. 

[Ian] Currently, uh, I really teach apart from `thesis` and the visual language which I really only teach a course called Doubt and Paradox, which is kind of a companion course to the thesis group. It gives them the chance to think in terms of a particular `problematic` doubt and paradox when thinking about their thesis work. So, this year I donated 'Australia,' I hope it flies as well. These are wonderful sort of `riffs` on language. Uh, handwriting is really important to me, what they call "`cursive`" these days but I grew up with "handwriting," and I think that the wonderful thing about handwriting is that it's almost like dancing, dancing on the page. It's not like printing, which is, kind of, kind of, I don't know, leaden in my view. But handwriting has this `marvelous` sort of dancing rhythm that appears on the page, so um, so I see these works, these uh, handwriting works, as a form of dancing, so you know, being an artist I think is a really interesting experience, uh, whether you're end up being a gallery artist like myself or not. Um, because uh, it teaches you I think that uh, you have your own skills and ability to fall back on, that you have something of value. That's a famous phrase but you have something of value, uh, and nobody can `gainsay` it, nobody can take it away from you, nobody can say you don't have it — you do. You get, you learn to become very resourceful uh, and to realize that uh, that uh, you just have to `persevere`, uh and you have something that you can `persevere` with. And I think that's uh, it's uh, kind of um, foundation that one has, and I think it's, it's something that we encourage the students to realize that they have, and that, you know, in the world all sorts of stuff happens and most of it isn't very interesting or it's not very pleasant sometimes, uh, but um, you always have this to hold onto.
