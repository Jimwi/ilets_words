Sir David Attenborough & President Obama 

WEBVTT Kind: captions Language: en 

Sir David Attenborough: Here there's virtually no water at all. So it seems really -- -- The blue whale. Today is my 89th birthday and to my very considerable surprise I find myself in a place that I've never been to before and which it is a great, great privilege to visit -- the White House. Mr. President, this is a great honor. 

The President: It is my honor. It's wonderful to see you. Thank you so much for taking the time. Come on. I grew up on some of your programming and -- 

Sir David Attenborough: Really? 

The President: Of course. 

Sir David Attenborough: (laughs) 

The President: And the -- since I grew up in Hawaii. 

Sir David Attenborough: What a great place to grow up. 

The President: You know, I had a natural `affinity` for the outdoors and an appreciation -- 

Sir David Attenborough: -- A lot of underwater swimming? 

The President: Oh yes. Let me backtrack for a second. How did you get interested in nature and wanting to record it? When you think back after this storied career, what is it that led you to such a deep `fascination` with how the natural world worked? 

Sir David Attenborough: Well, I've never met a child -- 

The President: -- Who's not fascinated? 

Sir David Attenborough: Who's not interested in natural history. So, the -- I mean, just the simplest thing -- a five-year-old turning over a stone and seeing a `slug`, you know, and says, "What a treasure. How does it live? What are those things on the front?" 

The President: Yeah. 

Sir David Attenborough: Kids love it. Kids understand the natural world and they're fascinated by it. So the question is, how did you lose it? 

The President: So you just never grew up? 

Sir David Attenborough: How did anyone lose the interest in nature? 

The President: Yeah. 

Sir David Attenborough: And certainly I never lost it. 

The President: Yeah. 

Sir David Attenborough: But if you do lose it and I imagine there are lots of other attractions that can make, divert your attention you've lost a very, very great treasure. 

The President: You know, growing up in Hawaii, it was one of the things that taught me not only to appreciate nature but also that you had to care for it. And, because we spent so much time outside and I think there was part of the native Hawaiian culture that is true of many native cultures in the sense of needing to care for the environment that you're in -- that sometimes we lose when we live in big cities. The interesting thing is though, my daughters I find -- Malia and Sasha, they're 16 and 13 now -- they're much more environmentally aware -- this generation -- 

Sir David Attenborough: I believe that. 

The President: -- than some previous generations. They do not `dispute`, for example, the science around climate change. They think it's self-apparent that we've got a problem and we should be doing something about it. 

Sir David Attenborough: Yeah, yeah. I absolutely agree. The letters I get, they bring tears to the eyes from kids of all ages and the young people. They care. They know that this is the world that they're going to grow up in and they're going to spend the rest of their lives in. 

The President: Right. 

Sir David Attenborough: But I think it's more idealistic than that. They actually believe that humanity -- human species -- has no right to destroy and `despoil` regardless. 

The President: Right. 

Sir David Attenborough: They actually feel that very powerfully. 

The President: They do. What do you think are some of the most stubborn misconceptions about nature that lead us not always to get out in front of these problems? 

Sir David Attenborough: I think what is required is an understanding and a gut feeling that you understand that the natural world is part of your `inheritance`. 

The President: Right. 

Sir David Attenborough: This is the planet on which we live. It's the only one we've got and we've got to protect it. And people do feel that deeply and `instinctively`. It is, after all, the natural world is where you go in moments of celebration and moments of grief. It is the greatest `propensity` to humanities own feeling for himself, itself, herself, ourself. 

The President: Right. The knowledge that well, you know, if you think about, you know, in all the world's religions, you know, when you're seeking wisdom -- you're seeking to hear God -- you're in the desert or you go to great waters or you go up to great mountain peaks. You know, recapturing that sense of wonder and the amazement of the natural world and its powers. You know, that's what speaks to what's deepest in us and, you know, the -- what's critically important is making sure that we're passing that on to future generations. You know, you and I, we've been blessed to be able to see it and experience it and be moved by it. And I want to make sure that my daughters and their children are experiencing that same thing.
