James Mitchell: Islamism and deception | VIEWPOINT

WEBVTT Kind: captions Language: en  

Marc: What did KSM tell you about deception?  

Jim: Well, he said that deception in Islam is expected.  You know, that basically...let me see if I can remember the order of them.  There's jihad by the sword and you can use deception to, much as we have done in our  military, to `feign` and to lure your enemies into traps.  And then there's jihad by the hand.  And in jihad by the hand, what you could do is if you couldn't fight, then you were expected  to use your money and to use your organizations, and that sort of stuff.  So you could set up an organization that, in theory, collected money for charities and  did that.  It was necessary that you actually do that, but part of that money went off to the side.  Maybe even the bulk of that money went off to the side to support jihad, you know.  And then there was deception, I think it was of the tongue.  

Marc: Jihad of the tongue.  

Jim: Huh?  

Marc: Jihad of the tongue?  

Jim: Yeah.  Yes, and the deception there was that you basically said things that sounded like you  were agreeing with the infidel, like "Islam is a religion of peace," when you know in your  mind and in your heart that the only way there's gonna be peace is if Sharia law is in the  whole world, or "Islam doesn't wanna kill innocents," and then in your head, you know that to be  innocent you first have to be a Muslim, all right, and then you have to be killed within  a certain range of time before you get to make a choice about it.  So these folks go back to these dormant traditions and try to breathe new life into it.  

Marc: And he told you, actually, that he saw Muslims condemning the 9/11 attacks and he  understood why they were doing it.  

Jim: Well, he understood why they were doing it, and he said he saw them rejoicing in their  eyes and in their heart.  That's what he said.
