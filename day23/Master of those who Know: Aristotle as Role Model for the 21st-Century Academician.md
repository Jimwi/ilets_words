00:00:05.031 --> 00:00:07.956
- [Voiceover] Stanford University.

00:00:07.956 --> 00:00:09.702
This program is brought to you by

00:00:09.702 --> 00:00:11.286
the Stanford Humanities Center.

00:00:17.257 --> 00:00:19.327
- Good evening, everybody,

00:00:19.327 --> 00:00:23.675
and welcome to the latest
in our series of lectures

00:00:23.675 --> 00:00:27.675
on classical culture, in
honor of Lorenz Eitner.

00:00:28.714 --> 00:00:30.217
My name is Richard Martin.

00:00:30.217 --> 00:00:32.696
I teach in the Classics Department here

00:00:32.696 --> 00:00:34.605
from time to time,

00:00:34.605 --> 00:00:38.223
and before the introduction
of our speaker this evening,

00:00:38.223 --> 00:00:40.662
it's really proper to say
a few words about the man

00:00:40.662 --> 00:00:43.668
for whom the lecture series is named.

00:00:43.668 --> 00:00:47.854
The late Lorenz Eitner was
Osgood Hooker Professor `Emeritus`

00:00:47.854 --> 00:00:50.294
of Fine Arts at Stanford.

00:00:50.294 --> 00:00:53.379
He was born in, what is
now the Czech Republic,

00:00:53.379 --> 00:00:55.453
to Austrian parents,

00:00:55.453 --> 00:00:57.605
and he spent his early years in Germany

00:00:57.605 --> 00:00:59.676
before immigrating to the United States

00:00:59.676 --> 00:01:01.093
at the age of 16,

00:01:02.031 --> 00:01:04.141
where he went to Duke University,

00:01:04.141 --> 00:01:05.724
graduating in 1940,

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:09.956
which meant that he
immediately went into the army,

00:01:09.956 --> 00:01:12.025
and during World War II, he served,

00:01:12.025 --> 00:01:13.975
like many future academics,

00:01:13.975 --> 00:01:15.805
as an intelligence officer,

00:01:15.805 --> 00:01:18.573
with the Office of Strategic Services,

00:01:18.573 --> 00:01:20.564
ending up at Nuremberg,

00:01:20.564 --> 00:01:23.687
in the Office of the Chief of Prosecution.

00:01:23.687 --> 00:01:25.556
So, on his return to the States,

00:01:25.556 --> 00:01:28.721
Eitner undertook Graduate
Studies in Art History

00:01:28.721 --> 00:01:29.941
at Princeton,

00:01:29.941 --> 00:01:32.774
where he received his PhD in 1952.

00:01:33.888 --> 00:01:38.113
Then began his long
association with Stanford.

00:01:38.113 --> 00:01:40.472
Actually, he was called
here from a position

00:01:40.472 --> 00:01:42.055
in Minnesota,

00:01:42.055 --> 00:01:44.372
specifically to chair
the Department of Art

00:01:44.372 --> 00:01:45.996
and Architecture.

00:01:45.996 --> 00:01:47.256
And the job included,

00:01:47.256 --> 00:01:49.493
without additional compensation,

00:01:49.493 --> 00:01:51.561
the new President might note,

00:01:51.561 --> 00:01:53.554
the task of overseeing the administration

00:01:53.554 --> 00:01:55.994
of the Stanford Museum.

00:01:55.994 --> 00:01:59.772
At that time, the Museum
was less concentrated on art

00:01:59.772 --> 00:02:02.777
or perhaps it was more
trendily post-modern

00:02:02.777 --> 00:02:04.936
than anyone ever imagined,

00:02:04.936 --> 00:02:07.007
because its collections included such

00:02:07.007 --> 00:02:10.980
material culture objects as a railroad car

00:02:10.980 --> 00:02:14.319
and a shark head embalmed in glass.

00:02:14.319 --> 00:02:15.412
(light laughter)

00:02:15.412 --> 00:02:17.320
The latter, which was acquired long before

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:19.185
Damien Hirst was even born.

00:02:19.185 --> 00:02:21.094
(laughter)

00:02:21.094 --> 00:02:23.085
Eitner refocused this museum,

00:02:23.085 --> 00:02:25.435
got rid of the railroad car,

00:02:25.435 --> 00:02:28.071
increasing its space more than tenfold,

00:02:28.071 --> 00:02:29.490
refurbished the galleries,

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:31.358
acquired important drawings and paintings,

00:02:31.358 --> 00:02:34.524
and largely made the Cantor
Center what it is today.

00:02:34.524 --> 00:02:37.932
He also oversaw the completion
of the Cummings Art Building,

00:02:37.932 --> 00:02:39.719
now recently torn to the ground,

00:02:39.719 --> 00:02:42.198
(laughter)

00:02:42.198 --> 00:02:44.429
and built up the Art History
Department, in other ways,

00:02:44.429 --> 00:02:47.765
through a number of
world-class appointments.

00:02:47.765 --> 00:02:50.204
His own research on
European Romantic paintings

00:02:50.204 --> 00:02:52.034
gained international recognition,

00:02:52.034 --> 00:02:55.126
especially his work on Gericault.

00:02:55.126 --> 00:02:58.787
For 25 years, until
his retirement in 1989,

00:02:58.787 --> 00:03:00.862
Eitner chaired the Department.

00:03:00.862 --> 00:03:02.161
Think of that, Grant.

00:03:02.161 --> 00:03:03.624
(light laughter)

00:03:03.624 --> 00:03:05.609
Even then, he continued to lead an active

00:03:05.609 --> 00:03:06.827
scholarly life.

00:03:06.827 --> 00:03:09.021
Up to the day of his death, in March 2009,

00:03:09.021 --> 00:03:12.146
he was corresponding, being
asked to authenticate paintings

00:03:12.146 --> 00:03:14.055
for dealers, et cetera,

00:03:14.055 --> 00:03:16.055
and he's remembered with admiration,

00:03:16.055 --> 00:03:18.217
as a scholar and administrator,

00:03:18.217 --> 00:03:20.122
but also as a teacher.

00:03:20.122 --> 00:03:22.924
He probably touched
more souls as a teacher

00:03:22.924 --> 00:03:24.020
than anything.

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:28.614
He would typically have
250 students in Art 1.

00:03:28.614 --> 00:03:31.983
His scholarship combined a
universality of thinking,

00:03:31.983 --> 00:03:34.218
with great taste and connoisseurship.

00:03:34.218 --> 00:03:36.452
So he embodied a passion not just for art,

00:03:36.452 --> 00:03:39.297
but a love of literature and humanities,

00:03:39.297 --> 00:03:43.198
in the ways that help
preserve our humane natures,

00:03:43.198 --> 00:03:45.635
ways from the past, creative
ways to bring the past

00:03:45.635 --> 00:03:47.383
to the contemporary world,

00:03:47.383 --> 00:03:50.593
which is what we think
our department still does,

00:03:50.593 --> 00:03:53.723
in these days of presentism and adulation

00:03:53.723 --> 00:03:55.269
of the merely technical,

00:03:55.269 --> 00:03:57.419
which I know is heresy to say in parts

00:03:57.419 --> 00:03:58.639
of this campus.

00:03:58.639 --> 00:04:01.560
We'd still like to
follow Eitner's example.

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:04.931
It was in his spirit that
the Department set out

00:04:04.931 --> 00:04:08.952
10 years ago to commemorate
him in the Eitner Lectures,

00:04:08.952 --> 00:04:12.002
and the inspiration and
essential support for that

00:04:12.002 --> 00:04:14.436
came from Peter and Lindsay Joost,

00:04:14.436 --> 00:04:16.794
and I am pleased once again to be able

00:04:16.794 --> 00:04:18.867
to acknowledge them this evening

00:04:18.867 --> 00:04:21.345
for their foresight and their on-going,

00:04:21.345 --> 00:04:22.601
wonderful commitment.

00:04:22.601 --> 00:04:25.322
Thank you, Peter and Lindsay.

00:04:25.322 --> 00:04:28.038
Our speaker tonight, joins a long line of

00:04:28.038 --> 00:04:29.745
internationally-renowned scholars

00:04:29.745 --> 00:04:32.427
who have lectured under the Eitner aegis,

00:04:32.427 --> 00:04:35.472
on the values and problematics
of Classical Culture,

00:04:35.472 --> 00:04:37.380
and so it is my pleasure now to turn over

00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:40.751
to my colleague and Classics Rush Rehm,

00:04:40.751 --> 00:04:44.501
the enviable task of
introducing our speaker.

00:04:51.803 --> 00:04:53.465
- I shall be brief.

00:04:53.465 --> 00:04:57.688
It is an extraordinary honor
to introduce Edith Hall.

00:04:57.688 --> 00:05:01.180
I don't know if any of you
were awakened last night

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:02.318
by the storm,

00:05:02.318 --> 00:05:03.460
but where I lived,

00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:05.849
it was extraordinary:
thunder, lightning, rain

00:05:05.849 --> 00:05:09.227
like I haven't heard where
I live in a long time,

00:05:09.227 --> 00:05:12.798
and I woke up, and I
thought, "Edith is coming."

00:05:12.798 --> 00:05:15.048
(laughter)

00:05:16.744 --> 00:05:21.046
She's held several
positions in universities

00:05:21.046 --> 00:05:24.362
at Reading, Durham,
Royal College Holloway,

00:05:24.362 --> 00:05:26.232
currently University College London,

00:05:26.232 --> 00:05:28.344
also Oxford and Cambridge,

00:05:28.344 --> 00:05:31.677
and she has done more than anyone I know

00:05:31.677 --> 00:05:35.694
to help us rethink Greek
tragedy, ancient performance,

00:05:35.694 --> 00:05:37.444
cultural receptivity,

00:05:38.290 --> 00:05:41.575
the dynamics of cultural reception,

00:05:41.575 --> 00:05:44.133
and her list of publications

00:05:44.133 --> 00:05:46.694
is absolutely unbelievable.

00:05:46.694 --> 00:05:49.900
I will just name a few of them.

00:05:49.900 --> 00:05:52.174
She's edited any number of volumes,

00:05:52.174 --> 00:05:54.086
a couple of them I've
actually had the good fortune

00:05:54.086 --> 00:05:55.630
to contribute to:

00:05:55.630 --> 00:05:58.434
Agamemnon in Performance,
Aristophanes in Performance,

00:05:58.434 --> 00:06:00.750
Medea in Performance.

00:06:00.750 --> 00:06:03.026
She's written on a groundbreaking book

00:06:03.026 --> 00:06:04.489
on Persians

00:06:04.489 --> 00:06:07.368
and the idea of the barbarian.

00:06:07.368 --> 00:06:09.604
She's written a relatively new book

00:06:09.604 --> 00:06:11.677
on Iphigenia among the Taurians.

00:06:11.677 --> 00:06:13.746
She's written books on slavery,

00:06:13.746 --> 00:06:15.979
on the reception of
Classics in Great Britain

00:06:15.979 --> 00:06:17.479
and also in India.

00:06:18.699 --> 00:06:20.326
The list is extraordinary.

00:06:20.326 --> 00:06:23.739
I don't know anyone with
the range of intelligence,

00:06:23.739 --> 00:06:26.218
the profligacy of mind,

00:06:26.218 --> 00:06:29.225
almost anything you pick up of Edith's

00:06:29.225 --> 00:06:31.892
is really, really worth reading.

00:06:32.885 --> 00:06:35.606
I wrote a review of one
of the books she edited

00:06:35.606 --> 00:06:37.960
and I'd found much of
the book unimpressive,

00:06:37.960 --> 00:06:39.100
except her essay,

00:06:39.100 --> 00:06:41.656
which I said "was
absolutely required reading

00:06:41.656 --> 00:06:43.891
"for anybody interested in Sophocles."

00:06:43.891 --> 00:06:45.274
So, without further ado,

00:06:45.274 --> 00:06:47.429
let me just introduce one
of the really wonderful,

00:06:47.429 --> 00:06:50.118
dynamic, amazing, intelligent Classicists.

00:06:50.118 --> 00:06:51.746
We are so lucky to have her here.

00:06:51.746 --> 00:06:52.885
Edith Hall.

00:06:52.885 --> 00:06:55.135
(applause)

00:07:03.084 --> 00:07:04.665
- Thank you so very much.

00:07:04.665 --> 00:07:06.411
Thank you very much, Richard.

00:07:06.411 --> 00:07:08.843
Thank you very much, Rush.

00:07:08.843 --> 00:07:12.710
Extraordinarily flattering introduction.

00:07:12.710 --> 00:07:15.024
And thank you in particular to

00:07:15.024 --> 00:07:17.217
Peter and Lindsay Joost

00:07:17.217 --> 00:07:20.264
for making this all possible.

00:07:20.264 --> 00:07:23.391
I'm really thrilled to be here.

00:07:23.391 --> 00:07:24.808
And, there he is.

00:07:27.782 --> 00:07:29.164
Lorenz Eitner.

00:07:29.164 --> 00:07:31.525
He was a great art historian,

00:07:31.525 --> 00:07:34.285
and it's to pay his memory respects,

00:07:34.285 --> 00:07:35.989
that I'm actually going to begin--

00:07:35.989 --> 00:07:38.101
He's looking at a `bust`,

00:07:38.101 --> 00:07:41.680
with Aristotle with the `bust` of Homer,

00:07:41.680 --> 00:07:44.605
now in the Metropolitan Museum of Art.

00:07:44.605 --> 00:07:47.022
Rembrandt painted it in 1653,

00:07:48.261 --> 00:07:52.428
for Antonio Ruffo, a Sicilian
aristocratic collector,

00:07:53.342 --> 00:07:56.675
and it solicited myriad interpretations.

00:07:57.779 --> 00:07:59.973
Beside the standing philosopher,

00:07:59.973 --> 00:08:01.963
on the bust of the ancient Greek poet,

00:08:01.963 --> 00:08:04.851
who composed, of course,
the epic Iliad and `Odyssey`,

00:08:04.851 --> 00:08:07.603
Rembrandt has included other ingredients.

00:08:07.603 --> 00:08:11.137
There's a medallion, suspended
from the heavy gold chain,

00:08:11.137 --> 00:08:14.835
adorned with the head
of Alexander the Great,

00:08:14.835 --> 00:08:17.418
Aristotle's student and patron.

00:08:18.327 --> 00:08:19.834
So what's going on here?

00:08:19.834 --> 00:08:21.906
Is the ruminating philosopher contrasting

00:08:21.906 --> 00:08:24.503
material and spiritual values,

00:08:24.503 --> 00:08:27.671
or comparing art with other forms

00:08:27.671 --> 00:08:31.891
of intellectual activity,
science, and philosophy?

00:08:31.891 --> 00:08:34.252
Or is the primary interest that Homer

00:08:34.252 --> 00:08:35.713
is blind,

00:08:35.713 --> 00:08:37.825
while Aristotle, who is touching him,

00:08:37.825 --> 00:08:40.140
but not looking quite directly at him,

00:08:40.140 --> 00:08:44.307
was a natural scientist who
favored an empirical method?

00:08:45.181 --> 00:08:47.576
I tend to agree with those art historians

00:08:47.576 --> 00:08:49.240
who think that Aristotle's attitude

00:08:49.240 --> 00:08:53.263
of mental abstraction is trying to suggest

00:08:53.263 --> 00:08:55.796
that his thoughts are directed not simply

00:08:55.796 --> 00:08:58.761
to the sculpture's superficial appearance,

00:08:58.761 --> 00:09:00.678
but also to its causes,

00:09:02.090 --> 00:09:03.349
or to Homer,

00:09:03.349 --> 00:09:06.599
or to the question of causation itself.

00:09:07.860 --> 00:09:12.576
For Aristotle, the very
activity of contemplation,

00:09:12.576 --> 00:09:15.828
which he called "theoria,"
our word, "Theory,"

00:09:15.828 --> 00:09:17.859
isn't limited to the appearances of things

00:09:17.859 --> 00:09:19.404
as we find them contingently,

00:09:19.404 --> 00:09:22.979
but is always concerned with their causes,

00:09:22.979 --> 00:09:25.336
on which more are non.

00:09:25.336 --> 00:09:27.207
In his metaphysics,

00:09:27.207 --> 00:09:30.903
Aristotle repeatedly
uses works of sculpture,

00:09:30.903 --> 00:09:34.845
when trying to illustrate
what he means by "causes."

00:09:34.845 --> 00:09:37.201
And his focus on the visual arts,

00:09:37.201 --> 00:09:38.461
in his metaphysics,

00:09:38.461 --> 00:09:40.818
inevitably drew the interest of artists,

00:09:40.818 --> 00:09:42.068
like Rembrandt.

00:09:43.623 --> 00:09:46.063
But the painting's conjunction of Homer,

00:09:46.063 --> 00:09:47.566
with golden chain,

00:09:47.566 --> 00:09:50.778
would inevitably prompt any classicist

00:09:50.778 --> 00:09:53.500
or classically-educated
17th century viewer

00:09:53.500 --> 00:09:55.914
just think, of course,
of the golden chain,

00:09:55.914 --> 00:09:58.558
with which Zeus in the Iliad boasts

00:09:58.558 --> 00:10:02.558
he could drag earth, sea,
and all the other Gods

00:10:03.475 --> 00:10:07.338
to Olympus and bind
them to dangle in space,

00:10:07.338 --> 00:10:10.222
and Zeus' golden chain was adopted by

00:10:10.222 --> 00:10:11.763
the Neoplatonists

00:10:11.763 --> 00:10:13.996
as an image of the mind of God,

00:10:13.996 --> 00:10:16.913
or of divine order in the universe.

00:10:18.143 --> 00:10:21.391
Bacon, and other 16th and
17th century thinkers,

00:10:21.391 --> 00:10:23.866
used it as an image of philosophy,

00:10:23.866 --> 00:10:25.493
or dialectic reason,

00:10:25.493 --> 00:10:27.493
as well as of Cosmology,

00:10:28.496 --> 00:10:30.203
but in 1650,

00:10:30.203 --> 00:10:33.292
just three years before
Rembrandt painted this picture,

00:10:33.292 --> 00:10:35.811
renowned classicist and fellow Dutchman,

00:10:35.811 --> 00:10:38.086
Gerhard Johann Vossius

00:10:38.086 --> 00:10:41.378
suggested a new interpretation,

00:10:41.378 --> 00:10:43.572
wonderful new interpretation.

00:10:43.572 --> 00:10:45.443
For Vossius, the chain represented

00:10:45.443 --> 00:10:50.033
the inter-relationship of
all the arts and sciences.

00:10:50.033 --> 00:10:52.147
The chain, which connects the knowledge

00:10:52.147 --> 00:10:54.504
of particulars in the separate fields,

00:10:54.504 --> 00:10:56.453
is, of course, the chain of...

00:10:56.453 --> 00:10:57.370
Philosophy.

00:10:58.525 --> 00:10:59.744
So, in this lecture,

00:10:59.744 --> 00:11:02.062
I want to think about
the interconnectiveness

00:11:02.062 --> 00:11:03.970
of all the arts and sciences,

00:11:03.970 --> 00:11:05.229
as represented,

00:11:05.229 --> 00:11:08.395
of course, by the activities
at Stanford University,

00:11:08.395 --> 00:11:13.108
with its unusual emphasis on
interdisciplinary research

00:11:13.108 --> 00:11:17.126
and the vision of its founders,
Jane and Leland Stanford,

00:11:17.126 --> 00:11:19.036
which I gather is being celebrated

00:11:19.036 --> 00:11:23.060
for its 125th anniversary this very year.

00:11:23.060 --> 00:11:25.011
They, having lost their only son,

00:11:25.011 --> 00:11:28.139
were determined to help
fulfill the potential

00:11:28.139 --> 00:11:31.229
of as many other young people as possible.

00:11:31.229 --> 00:11:34.394
Now, and potential is a
key word in this lecture,

00:11:34.394 --> 00:11:37.162
since I can't link all the
arts and sciences together

00:11:37.162 --> 00:11:38.825
with a cosmic chain,

00:11:38.825 --> 00:11:40.451
nor indeed one `bestowed` on me

00:11:40.451 --> 00:11:42.361
by Alexander the Great,

00:11:42.361 --> 00:11:44.433
then I can at least try to do it

00:11:44.433 --> 00:11:47.027
with a 21st-century celebration of

00:11:47.027 --> 00:11:49.301
Aristotle's towering achievements

00:11:49.301 --> 00:11:52.306
and with thoughts about how we can benefit

00:11:52.306 --> 00:11:55.434
from one of his most extraordinary ideas,

00:11:55.434 --> 00:11:57.832
which is potentiality.

00:11:57.832 --> 00:11:59.744
"Dunamis," dynamite.

00:11:59.744 --> 00:12:01.577
Aristotelian dynamite.

00:12:03.360 --> 00:12:06.285
In Leland Stanford's fourth Senate speech,

00:12:06.285 --> 00:12:08.720
on behalf of his land loan bill,

00:12:08.720 --> 00:12:11.319
he supported his progressive case

00:12:11.319 --> 00:12:13.639
with questions from political theorists,

00:12:13.639 --> 00:12:15.305
including Aristotle,

00:12:15.305 --> 00:12:17.298
as well as Benjamin Franklin, David Hume,

00:12:17.298 --> 00:12:19.535
and John Stuart Mill.

00:12:19.535 --> 00:12:21.728
And this year, come July,

00:12:21.728 --> 00:12:24.493
will mark another very
important anniversary.

00:12:24.493 --> 00:12:26.910
Aristotle's 2,400th birthday.

00:12:29.439 --> 00:12:31.356
In Stagira, in 384 B.C.

00:12:32.608 --> 00:12:34.858
(laughter)

00:12:36.628 --> 00:12:38.620
Stagira is the Eastern prong

00:12:38.620 --> 00:12:42.074
of the triple peninsula of Calcidice,

00:12:42.074 --> 00:12:43.780
in the Northern Aegean,

00:12:43.780 --> 00:12:45.200
and there will be celebrations

00:12:45.200 --> 00:12:47.108
around his statue there.

00:12:47.108 --> 00:12:50.557
Actually, I'm going in April to do

00:12:50.557 --> 00:12:52.224
some reconnoitering.

00:12:53.360 --> 00:12:55.108
Now, Aristotle is today, of course,

00:12:55.108 --> 00:12:57.465
an extraordinarily controversial figure,

00:12:57.465 --> 00:13:01.690
and Josh Ober is one
of the biggest experts

00:13:01.690 --> 00:13:04.169
on just why he's so controversial.

00:13:04.169 --> 00:13:07.623
His historically contingent
ideas about women's slaves,

00:13:07.623 --> 00:13:09.173
empires and elites,

00:13:09.173 --> 00:13:12.701
`excised` from the context
of their expression

00:13:12.701 --> 00:13:14.652
in his politics,

00:13:14.652 --> 00:13:16.277
especially Book 1,

00:13:16.277 --> 00:13:18.878
have received a very
great deal of criticism,

00:13:18.878 --> 00:13:23.505
quite rightly from feminists
and civil rights activists.

00:13:23.505 --> 00:13:25.989
But these unconscionable views

00:13:25.989 --> 00:13:28.833
must, surely, not be allowed to eclipse

00:13:28.833 --> 00:13:31.393
his monumental achievements
in other fields.

00:13:31.393 --> 00:13:33.955
He wrote over 150 treatises,

00:13:33.955 --> 00:13:37.407
which changed intellectual
history forever.

00:13:37.407 --> 00:13:40.822
We are Aristotelians,
in some way or another,

00:13:40.822 --> 00:13:43.136
in the way we think.

00:13:43.136 --> 00:13:44.722
There are, of course, many aspects of him

00:13:44.722 --> 00:13:46.266
to emulate.

00:13:46.266 --> 00:13:47.886
He didn't patronize people with whom

00:13:47.886 --> 00:13:49.266
he disagreed,

00:13:49.266 --> 00:13:52.149
he even talked respectfully
about pre-scientific thinkers

00:13:52.149 --> 00:13:54.301
on the mythological
origins of the universe,

00:13:54.301 --> 00:13:57.472
because he "got it," that
their works were attempts

00:13:57.472 --> 00:14:00.518
at an explanation of first principles.

00:14:00.518 --> 00:14:02.754
Although he was quite clear that religion

00:14:02.754 --> 00:14:06.330
could be used by despots to
manipulate their subjects,

00:14:06.330 --> 00:14:08.239
he was unlike some more polemical thinkers

00:14:08.239 --> 00:14:09.417
of his time,

00:14:09.417 --> 00:14:12.336
in that he didn't regard
the practice of religion,

00:14:12.336 --> 00:14:16.560
doing religion, as a verb,
piety, with contempt.

00:14:16.560 --> 00:14:18.673
And he saw no contradiction,

00:14:18.673 --> 00:14:20.785
and I find this very appealing,

00:14:20.785 --> 00:14:22.733
between looking for
scientific explanations

00:14:22.733 --> 00:14:24.527
of the things in the universe

00:14:24.527 --> 00:14:27.898
and assuming that there was
a disinterested divinity,

00:14:27.898 --> 00:14:30.981
his "unmoved mover" beyond human ken.

00:14:32.569 --> 00:14:35.534
In fact, he seems to have
sensed a relationship

00:14:35.534 --> 00:14:37.646
well before Stephen Hawking's,

00:14:37.646 --> 00:14:39.468
between sort of divinity

00:14:39.468 --> 00:14:42.474
and the concept of the act of intellect,

00:14:42.474 --> 00:14:44.668
a sense underlying his accounts

00:14:44.668 --> 00:14:47.310
of how the human intellect develops

00:14:47.310 --> 00:14:50.397
from its original unthinking state

00:14:50.397 --> 00:14:53.447
in On the Soul and Metaphysics.

00:14:53.447 --> 00:14:55.721
It's not actually completely clear

00:14:55.721 --> 00:14:58.621
whether his concept of
the active intellect

00:14:58.621 --> 00:15:00.205
is inherent in humans

00:15:00.205 --> 00:15:03.372
or somehow externally operating on them,

00:15:03.372 --> 00:15:06.252
but he did see some link between

00:15:06.252 --> 00:15:10.069
the active intellect, human
intellectual potential,

00:15:10.069 --> 00:15:11.402
when actualized,

00:15:12.867 --> 00:15:17.034
with the "unmoved mover,"
and therefore, with God.

00:15:18.102 --> 00:15:20.212
And his reception, at least,
until the Renaissance,

00:15:20.212 --> 00:15:22.325
offers us a paradigm for emphasizing

00:15:22.325 --> 00:15:25.426
what Western and Arabic
intellectual traditions

00:15:25.426 --> 00:15:27.176
have in common.

00:15:27.176 --> 00:15:28.594
His Metaphysics in particular,

00:15:28.594 --> 00:15:30.220
when translated into Arabic

00:15:30.220 --> 00:15:31.642
was instrumental in the foundation

00:15:31.642 --> 00:15:35.951
of "falsafa," Arabic
philosophy in the 9th century,

00:15:35.951 --> 00:15:38.795
and elicited a massive commentary

00:15:38.795 --> 00:15:43.270
by the Spanish Arab
philosopher Ibn Rushd Averroes.

00:15:43.270 --> 00:15:46.235
Studied avidly in the West as well.

00:15:46.235 --> 00:15:48.267
And just as valuable for us to think about

00:15:48.267 --> 00:15:50.865
is his identification of the primary goal

00:15:50.865 --> 00:15:52.570
of human life,

00:15:52.570 --> 00:15:55.334
with individual mental fulfillment

00:15:55.334 --> 00:15:57.568
and virtue-based happiness,

00:15:57.568 --> 00:16:00.414
however we like to translate eudaimonia.

00:16:00.414 --> 00:16:03.581
I often think it needs to be
translated as "competence."

00:16:03.581 --> 00:16:05.498
Just doing things well.

00:16:06.507 --> 00:16:09.190
And responsibility to the whole community,

00:16:09.190 --> 00:16:12.565
rather than with wealth acquisition.

00:16:12.565 --> 00:16:14.557
Aristotle approved of certain amount of

00:16:14.557 --> 00:16:16.587
distributive economic justice.

00:16:16.587 --> 00:16:19.556
He understood that poverty is a cause

00:16:19.556 --> 00:16:21.556
of revolution and crime,

00:16:22.396 --> 00:16:24.019
but the achievement I want to focus on,

00:16:24.019 --> 00:16:25.528
on the first half of the lecture,

00:16:25.528 --> 00:16:27.679
after a biographical sketch

00:16:27.679 --> 00:16:29.547
is Aristotle's transcendence

00:16:29.547 --> 00:16:31.336
of the distinction between research

00:16:31.336 --> 00:16:33.324
in different fields,

00:16:33.324 --> 00:16:36.044
and this will lead us into the discussion

00:16:36.044 --> 00:16:38.440
towards the end of his unique concept

00:16:38.440 --> 00:16:40.631
of the dunamis, the dynamite,

00:16:40.631 --> 00:16:43.146
the potentiality within things

00:16:43.146 --> 00:16:46.758
and how that concept
might enrich deliberation

00:16:46.758 --> 00:16:49.845
about the education of all our citizens

00:16:49.845 --> 00:16:53.745
in our increasingly globalized village.

00:16:53.745 --> 00:16:56.578
Now, in 1959, the year I was born,

00:16:57.443 --> 00:16:58.971
the physical chemist and novelist

00:16:58.971 --> 00:17:03.234
C.P. Snow delivered the
Rede Lecture at Cambridge

00:17:03.234 --> 00:17:05.713
and he lamented the gulf yawning between

00:17:05.713 --> 00:17:06.811
the two worlds.

00:17:06.811 --> 00:17:08.761
He called them galaxies,

00:17:08.761 --> 00:17:11.564
constituting the sciences and

00:17:11.564 --> 00:17:15.102
the arts plus humanities, respectively.

00:17:15.102 --> 00:17:17.499
"Literary intellectuals,"
he said,"at one pole

00:17:17.499 --> 00:17:19.082
"at the other scientists...

00:17:19.082 --> 00:17:22.780
"Between the two a gulf of
mutual incomprehension--

00:17:22.780 --> 00:17:24.649
"Sometimes... hostility and dislike,

00:17:24.649 --> 00:17:27.534
"most of all lack of understanding."

00:17:27.534 --> 00:17:30.094
And the lack of
understanding had prevailed

00:17:30.094 --> 00:17:31.558
instead of the nurturing,

00:17:31.558 --> 00:17:33.996
with what he called a "clashing point

00:17:33.996 --> 00:17:36.149
"between arts and sciences,"

00:17:36.149 --> 00:17:37.973
which could produce what he called,

00:17:37.973 --> 00:17:40.806
"Creative Chances," opportunities.

00:17:41.837 --> 00:17:44.170
Snow argued, then, Cold War,

00:17:45.010 --> 00:17:47.408
that without the
industrialization of the planet,

00:17:47.408 --> 00:17:49.929
the rich/poor divide, globally,

00:17:49.929 --> 00:17:51.834
would only grow,

00:17:51.834 --> 00:17:53.298
and I know that this is something that

00:17:53.298 --> 00:17:55.613
Walter Scheidel is very interested in,

00:17:55.613 --> 00:17:58.254
both the USA and the USSR, he said,

00:17:58.254 --> 00:18:00.408
needed to train squadrons of scientists

00:18:00.408 --> 00:18:02.356
to bring about the improvement
of living conditions

00:18:02.356 --> 00:18:03.606
for all humans.

00:18:04.551 --> 00:18:06.178
And despite the steady rise of

00:18:06.178 --> 00:18:07.844
the third academic cultures,

00:18:07.844 --> 00:18:09.998
the social sciences,

00:18:09.998 --> 00:18:12.113
the gulf between Snow's galaxies

00:18:12.113 --> 00:18:14.794
yawns as widely as ever.

00:18:14.794 --> 00:18:16.377
Historically, it's been connected with

00:18:16.377 --> 00:18:19.469
the celebration of Plato over Aristotle

00:18:19.469 --> 00:18:23.209
and indeed, of Erasmus over
Renaissance scientists,

00:18:23.209 --> 00:18:25.886
like Kepler and Copernicus.

00:18:25.886 --> 00:18:27.552
In my own country,

00:18:27.552 --> 00:18:28.969
very little has happened to bring

00:18:28.969 --> 00:18:30.752
Snow's two galaxies closer.

00:18:30.752 --> 00:18:33.150
Most people who continue school after 16

00:18:33.150 --> 00:18:36.155
specialize in arts or sciences.

00:18:36.155 --> 00:18:38.515
My daughter is most unusual in doing

00:18:38.515 --> 00:18:41.482
Double Maths, History,
Economics, and French.

00:18:41.482 --> 00:18:44.571
That's actually most unusual.

00:18:44.571 --> 00:18:47.128
Although most people are
dragged through a play

00:18:47.128 --> 00:18:49.932
by Shakespeare before 16

00:18:49.932 --> 00:18:53.548
and a smattering of deeply
parochial national history

00:18:53.548 --> 00:18:56.191
that never mentions the British Empire,

00:18:56.191 --> 00:18:59.766
very few can explain the
Second Law of Thermodynamics.

00:18:59.766 --> 00:19:00.910
Now I now can!

00:19:00.910 --> 00:19:02.408
(light laughter)

00:19:02.408 --> 00:19:04.765
It's the one about the egg, OK?

00:19:04.765 --> 00:19:07.445
(laughter)

00:19:07.445 --> 00:19:09.272
Now the gap between the two galaxies

00:19:09.272 --> 00:19:11.591
is usually traced to the
industrial revolution,

00:19:11.591 --> 00:19:14.439
but the domination of education of elites

00:19:14.439 --> 00:19:16.834
by humanities actually has a far longer

00:19:16.834 --> 00:19:18.132
and more complicated history,

00:19:18.132 --> 00:19:20.733
stretching back to Classical Antiquity.

00:19:20.733 --> 00:19:23.700
The natural scientist, the physiologus,

00:19:23.700 --> 00:19:26.215
is already portrayed as a figure of fun,

00:19:26.215 --> 00:19:30.215
by comedian Aristophanes
in the 5th Century B.C.

00:19:31.057 --> 00:19:32.967
The physiologus in question, of course,

00:19:32.967 --> 00:19:33.982
was Socrates,

00:19:33.982 --> 00:19:35.525
who was interested in
the physical constitution

00:19:35.525 --> 00:19:37.805
of the universe as a young man.

00:19:37.805 --> 00:19:40.692
Unfortunately, Socrates
left no written record

00:19:40.692 --> 00:19:43.743
of any of his studies on
cosmology or anything else,

00:19:43.743 --> 00:19:45.573
and his student, Plato,

00:19:45.573 --> 00:19:49.110
who really did despise
the material universe,

00:19:49.110 --> 00:19:53.051
and regarded a set of
second-rate simulacra

00:19:53.051 --> 00:19:54.884
of non-material ideas,

00:19:55.733 --> 00:19:57.965
I think, has to bear a
lot of responsibility

00:19:57.965 --> 00:19:59.997
for the separation between the studies

00:19:59.997 --> 00:20:03.536
we lump under the headings
of Arts and Science.

00:20:03.536 --> 00:20:05.447
Now, Platonic philosophy is written in

00:20:05.447 --> 00:20:09.614
alluring, humorous, glossy,
whimsical prose dialogues.

00:20:12.394 --> 00:20:14.751
Aristotle also wrote artistic dialogues,

00:20:14.751 --> 00:20:17.760
designed for a wider public
than his dry treatises,

00:20:17.760 --> 00:20:20.274
but sadly, none of the literary ones,

00:20:20.274 --> 00:20:24.008
the accessible literary
ones have survived.

00:20:24.008 --> 00:20:27.707
Now there are a few rather `contrived` puns

00:20:27.707 --> 00:20:30.624
in Aristotle's surviving treatises,

00:20:31.564 --> 00:20:35.506
but Plato's style was, in
antiquity, far more appealing

00:20:35.506 --> 00:20:39.774
than Aristotle's to pretty much everybody.

00:20:39.774 --> 00:20:42.816
Plato's thought with
infinitely more preferred

00:20:42.816 --> 00:20:44.842
by Ancient Christians
with their need to posit

00:20:44.842 --> 00:20:48.052
a spiritual world prior
to the material one,

00:20:48.052 --> 00:20:50.205
and Neo-Platonism helped to fertilize

00:20:50.205 --> 00:20:52.110
the animosity between Christianity and

00:20:52.110 --> 00:20:53.815
scientific inquiry

00:20:53.815 --> 00:20:56.291
that still reverberates among
Christian fundamentalists

00:20:56.291 --> 00:20:57.304
today,

00:20:57.304 --> 00:21:00.476
especially American Creationists.

00:21:00.476 --> 00:21:02.427
Aristotle, on the other
hand, believed that

00:21:02.427 --> 00:21:04.903
things in the world take
their definition from

00:21:04.903 --> 00:21:07.461
their particular material properties,

00:21:07.461 --> 00:21:10.545
neither from some immaterial
essence or ideal form,

00:21:10.545 --> 00:21:13.272
nor from the thought of God.

00:21:13.272 --> 00:21:15.912
And he investigated the
world through recording

00:21:15.912 --> 00:21:17.372
it empirically

00:21:17.372 --> 00:21:19.607
and developing logical
systems of analyzing

00:21:19.607 --> 00:21:21.357
those empirical data.

00:21:22.896 --> 00:21:25.416
Now of all the great minds of antiquity,

00:21:25.416 --> 00:21:27.772
Aristotle's is the one
which raised the bar

00:21:27.772 --> 00:21:29.925
on intellectual inquiry,
in a way that still

00:21:29.925 --> 00:21:33.752
profoundly affects what
all academic researchers

00:21:33.752 --> 00:21:36.797
and their students do today.

00:21:36.797 --> 00:21:38.382
What do we know about him?

00:21:38.382 --> 00:21:40.818
There are several ancient
sources of biography,

00:21:40.818 --> 00:21:44.274
including A Life by Diogenes Laertius,

00:21:44.274 --> 00:21:47.767
though most of it consists
of gossipy fictions,

00:21:47.767 --> 00:21:49.684
invented by detractors.

00:21:50.734 --> 00:21:53.658
What is certain is that
he was from Stagira,

00:21:53.658 --> 00:21:56.544
a small, but strategically
important city-state,

00:21:56.544 --> 00:21:58.616
which had seen conquerors and allies,

00:21:58.616 --> 00:22:01.699
including Persia, Athens, and Sparta.

00:22:02.600 --> 00:22:06.499
When Aristotle was born, 2,400 years ago,

00:22:06.499 --> 00:22:10.402
Stagira was increasingly
dominated by its mighty neighbor,

00:22:10.402 --> 00:22:11.235
Macedon.

00:22:12.269 --> 00:22:14.457
Aristotle's dad was physician to

00:22:14.457 --> 00:22:16.487
King Amyntus III of Macedon,

00:22:16.487 --> 00:22:19.658
who ruled between 393 and 370,

00:22:19.658 --> 00:22:22.704
and was the father of Philip the Second.

00:22:22.704 --> 00:22:24.574
The royal family and the medical family

00:22:24.574 --> 00:22:27.012
may have been very close,

00:22:27.012 --> 00:22:29.531
and Aristotle, interestingly to me,

00:22:29.531 --> 00:22:33.188
was an almost exact
contemporary of Philip.

00:22:33.188 --> 00:22:36.888
He was born just two
years after him, in 382.

00:22:36.888 --> 00:22:39.689
Sorry, Philip was born
just two years later.

00:22:39.689 --> 00:22:42.022
So, they're very much equal,

00:22:42.857 --> 00:22:46.722
in terms of age and historical experience.

00:22:46.722 --> 00:22:48.591
Now, Aristotle went off as a youth,

00:22:48.591 --> 00:22:50.334
a precocious youth we understand,

00:22:50.334 --> 00:22:52.078
to Athens to study with Plato,

00:22:52.078 --> 00:22:54.068
where else but at the Academy,

00:22:54.068 --> 00:22:56.871
and he stayed there 20 years.

00:22:56.871 --> 00:22:59.697
Much of his work is a
response to Plato's ideas,

00:22:59.697 --> 00:23:02.464
although their disagreements
are absolutely fundamental,

00:23:02.464 --> 00:23:05.149
and I think they probably
were from much earlier

00:23:05.149 --> 00:23:06.732
than Werner Jaeger.

00:23:08.278 --> 00:23:11.200
Aristotle left Athens in 348,

00:23:11.200 --> 00:23:13.844
in the year when Philip finally destroyed

00:23:13.844 --> 00:23:16.120
poor little Stagira.

00:23:16.120 --> 00:23:20.120
The philosopher went not
to Northwest Asia Minor

00:23:21.402 --> 00:23:23.235
to Assos and Atarneus.

00:23:24.532 --> 00:23:28.425
Actually, to the place just over the water

00:23:28.425 --> 00:23:29.844
from Lesbos,

00:23:29.844 --> 00:23:33.298
where all the poor refugees
are setting out from,

00:23:33.298 --> 00:23:35.735
to the court of his friend, Hermias,

00:23:35.735 --> 00:23:38.664
who had been a fellow
student at the Academy.

00:23:38.664 --> 00:23:41.259
A great friendship was
very, very important

00:23:41.259 --> 00:23:43.900
for Aristotle and all his sort.

00:23:43.900 --> 00:23:47.644
He even married Hermias'
daughter, Pythias.

00:23:47.644 --> 00:23:49.477
Then he went over that

00:23:50.732 --> 00:23:52.969
strait to Lesbos,

00:23:52.969 --> 00:23:55.406
where he studied zoology intensively

00:23:55.406 --> 00:23:58.207
alongside another friend from the Academy,

00:23:58.207 --> 00:24:01.133
Theophrastus, whose specialism was botany,

00:24:01.133 --> 00:24:03.365
and this is my key picture.

00:24:03.365 --> 00:24:07.465
I just love the idea of
all these lions on Lesbos.

00:24:07.465 --> 00:24:10.225
This is Aristotle enjoying the animals

00:24:10.225 --> 00:24:13.308
and Theophrastus enjoying the plants.

00:24:14.532 --> 00:24:17.214
The importance of the wildlife,

00:24:17.214 --> 00:24:19.733
in and around the lagoon at Pyrrha,

00:24:19.733 --> 00:24:21.236
on that island,

00:24:21.236 --> 00:24:23.772
where I'm also going at Easter,

00:24:23.772 --> 00:24:26.940
has recently been explained
in a really beautiful book

00:24:26.940 --> 00:24:29.420
by Armand Marie Leroi:

00:24:29.420 --> 00:24:33.119
The Lagoon: How Aristotle
Invented Science.

00:24:33.119 --> 00:24:35.637
But in 343, Aristotle
took up the apppointment

00:24:35.637 --> 00:24:38.304
to tutor to the young Alexander,

00:24:39.578 --> 00:24:41.487
and I love it, when you get off a boat

00:24:41.487 --> 00:24:44.737
of Thessaloniki, just as
Aristotle must often have done,

00:24:44.737 --> 00:24:46.820
this is now what you see.

00:24:49.942 --> 00:24:52.052
So short legs, so, aren't they?

00:24:52.052 --> 00:24:54.005
You know, hey.

00:24:54.005 --> 00:24:57.254
Eight years he was his tutor,

00:24:57.254 --> 00:24:59.733
and eight years later in 335,

00:24:59.733 --> 00:25:01.806
when Alexander had succeeded Philip

00:25:01.806 --> 00:25:03.510
and taken control of Athens,

00:25:03.510 --> 00:25:06.723
Aristotle returned to
Athens to find his Lyceum,

00:25:06.723 --> 00:25:09.723
and write most of those treatises in

00:25:10.746 --> 00:25:12.746
his golden sixth decade.

00:25:13.588 --> 00:25:17.207
He's a great example
of those of us over 50,

00:25:17.207 --> 00:25:19.928
who are worried that we're losing it.

00:25:19.928 --> 00:25:22.325
The period of intense
intellectual activity in Athens

00:25:22.325 --> 00:25:24.479
was cut short by the death
of Alexander, though,

00:25:24.479 --> 00:25:25.312
in 323.

00:25:26.633 --> 00:25:28.746
The Athenians turned against everyone

00:25:28.746 --> 00:25:30.983
associated with Macedonian rule.

00:25:30.983 --> 00:25:33.053
Aristotle sensed danger

00:25:33.053 --> 00:25:35.121
and seems to have been
charged with failing

00:25:35.121 --> 00:25:36.456
to honor the Gods,

00:25:36.456 --> 00:25:37.838
a political move, probably,

00:25:37.838 --> 00:25:39.301
rather than a religious one,

00:25:39.301 --> 00:25:41.536
and he escaped the family estate,

00:25:41.536 --> 00:25:44.618
which belonged to his mother in Euboea,

00:25:44.618 --> 00:25:47.010
Ewia, the very, very long island,

00:25:47.010 --> 00:25:50.947
on the sort of eastern side
of the mainland of Greece,

00:25:50.947 --> 00:25:52.650
and he died the year after,

00:25:52.650 --> 00:25:55.291
either by natural causes,
perhaps stomach cancer,

00:25:55.291 --> 00:25:56.208
or suicide.

00:25:57.645 --> 00:26:00.128
The place of his burial isn't known.

00:26:00.128 --> 00:26:02.931
The medieval travelogue of my compatriot,

00:26:02.931 --> 00:26:06.514
Sir John Mandeville,
first printed in 1499,

00:26:08.168 --> 00:26:10.603
claimed that there was a tomb and a cult,

00:26:10.603 --> 00:26:13.020
as if for a saint in Stagira,

00:26:14.623 --> 00:26:18.240
but British archaeologist,
Sir Charles Walston,

00:26:18.240 --> 00:26:20.191
on the other hand,

00:26:20.191 --> 00:26:22.631
claimed to have excavated
Aristotle's tomb,

00:26:22.631 --> 00:26:24.417
complete with writing styluses

00:26:24.417 --> 00:26:27.334
under portrait statuette in Euboea,

00:26:28.602 --> 00:26:31.352
near Chalcis, in the early 1890s.

00:26:32.583 --> 00:26:34.333
I'm going there, too.

00:26:35.470 --> 00:26:37.706
The death tradition
with the most resonance

00:26:37.706 --> 00:26:39.246
and cultural history

00:26:39.246 --> 00:26:41.965
claims that Aristotle leapt into the waves

00:26:41.965 --> 00:26:44.033
at the narrow straits at Euripus,

00:26:44.033 --> 00:26:47.283
which divides Euboea from the mainland.

00:26:49.242 --> 00:26:51.520
He leapt into them and drowned,

00:26:51.520 --> 00:26:54.684
and the suicide was allegedly
motivated by frustration

00:26:54.684 --> 00:26:57.121
that he couldn't get to understand,

00:26:57.121 --> 00:27:01.794
solve the problem of the very
real, violent tides there,

00:27:01.794 --> 00:27:04.760
which reversed direction four times a day,

00:27:04.760 --> 00:27:06.794
and actually, this problem wasn't solved

00:27:06.794 --> 00:27:09.716
until an article by a
brilliant Greek astronomer,

00:27:09.716 --> 00:27:12.049
Demetrius Eginitis, in 1929.

00:27:14.633 --> 00:27:16.990
Now this suicide was an invention

00:27:16.990 --> 00:27:19.262
of his early Christian detractors,

00:27:19.262 --> 00:27:20.688
who wanted to present him as something

00:27:20.688 --> 00:27:22.431
finally acknowledged,

00:27:22.431 --> 00:27:26.181
he couldn't explain the
universe without God.

00:27:27.100 --> 00:27:29.783
He was supposed to have
cried out as he fell,

00:27:29.783 --> 00:27:33.193
"Since Aristotle didn't grasp the Euripus,

00:27:33.193 --> 00:27:35.733
"let Euripus take Aristotle."

00:27:35.733 --> 00:27:38.736
And this fabricated acceptance of Deism

00:27:38.736 --> 00:27:41.176
continued to be cited by Christians

00:27:41.176 --> 00:27:43.858
until Dryden's Catholic Conversion tract

00:27:43.858 --> 00:27:45.691
Religio Laici of 1682,

00:27:46.621 --> 00:27:48.451
and there's some lines from that

00:27:48.451 --> 00:27:50.928
under this picture of Aristotle supposed

00:27:50.928 --> 00:27:52.390
Euripus suicide,

00:27:52.390 --> 00:27:56.534
which circulated a century later, in 1786.

00:27:56.534 --> 00:27:58.075
This is all an attempt to say,

00:27:58.075 --> 00:28:00.489
"It's OK to be an
Aristotelian and do science,

00:28:00.489 --> 00:28:02.610
"but we mustn't forget that he converted

00:28:02.610 --> 00:28:04.842
"at the last minute."

00:28:04.842 --> 00:28:07.359
Now the Christian obsession
with Aristotle's position

00:28:07.359 --> 00:28:08.619
on God and nature,

00:28:08.619 --> 00:28:11.189
has obscured the range of his interests.

00:28:11.189 --> 00:28:13.014
There was no constituent of the universe

00:28:13.014 --> 00:28:15.084
in which he wasn't interested.

00:28:15.084 --> 00:28:18.136
Whether it was empirically
discernible to the senses

00:28:18.136 --> 00:28:20.576
or lying beneath and beyond
the perceptible surface

00:28:20.576 --> 00:28:21.409
of things.

00:28:22.324 --> 00:28:24.864
In the Nicomachea and the Eudemian Ethics,

00:28:24.864 --> 00:28:29.458
he posits happiness, eudaemonia,
living competently and well

00:28:29.458 --> 00:28:32.712
as the fundamental goal in human life,

00:28:32.712 --> 00:28:36.161
and Thomas Jefferson,
undoubtedly, got the idea

00:28:36.161 --> 00:28:38.962
of the pursuit of
happiness from Aristotle.

00:28:38.962 --> 00:28:41.928
Eudaemonia is an activity,
rather than an abstract state.

00:28:41.928 --> 00:28:44.523
The function of human
life is to perform it.

00:28:44.523 --> 00:28:46.354
Its equivalent to living rationally

00:28:46.354 --> 00:28:49.035
in an examined and liberated way,

00:28:49.035 --> 00:28:51.999
in accordance with virtue, "arete."

00:28:51.999 --> 00:28:53.990
On Aristotle's political theories,

00:28:53.990 --> 00:28:55.812
an extension of this ethical position

00:28:55.812 --> 00:28:58.657
to the whole community or city-state,

00:28:58.657 --> 00:29:02.761
since happiness, living well,
and competently together

00:29:02.761 --> 00:29:04.426
is the goal of the city-state,

00:29:04.426 --> 00:29:07.877
and the reason for its existence.

00:29:07.877 --> 00:29:12.044
On two of Aristotle's ideas
about competently living,

00:29:13.025 --> 00:29:14.781
this good life had been the lynch pin of

00:29:14.781 --> 00:29:16.125
my own morality.

00:29:16.125 --> 00:29:17.550
Confession time.

00:29:17.550 --> 00:29:20.354
Since I first encountered
him as a student,

00:29:20.354 --> 00:29:22.708
having listened to too much R.E.M.

00:29:22.708 --> 00:29:24.496
and lost my religion.

00:29:24.496 --> 00:29:27.015
I was brought up quite
a strict Protestant,

00:29:27.015 --> 00:29:28.152
at the age of 13,

00:29:28.152 --> 00:29:30.712
and I had a huge moral and ethical vacuum,

00:29:30.712 --> 00:29:32.257
which I didn't manage to fill

00:29:32.257 --> 00:29:35.629
until I read Aristotle's
Nicomachean Ethics

00:29:35.629 --> 00:29:36.796
at University.

00:29:38.923 --> 00:29:41.694
The first is the
importance of deliberation,

00:29:41.694 --> 00:29:44.922
taught (mumbles).

00:29:44.922 --> 00:29:47.629
Although, because of
the element of chance,

00:29:47.629 --> 00:29:49.294
you can never guarantee that you will make

00:29:49.294 --> 00:29:51.485
what turns out to be the
most advantageous decision

00:29:51.485 --> 00:29:53.279
when you deliberate,

00:29:53.279 --> 00:29:55.591
you can guarantee that you deliberated

00:29:55.591 --> 00:29:59.085
in the way best equipped
to maximize your chances

00:29:59.085 --> 00:30:02.827
of achieving the most
advantageous outcome,

00:30:02.827 --> 00:30:05.872
and this involves a certain
method of deliberation

00:30:05.872 --> 00:30:08.179
a massing and verifying information,

00:30:08.179 --> 00:30:10.089
investigating precedents,

00:30:10.089 --> 00:30:12.890
consulting disinterested specialists

00:30:12.890 --> 00:30:15.223
and calibrating likelihoods.

00:30:16.550 --> 00:30:18.340
Now because I'm actually so impetuous,

00:30:18.340 --> 00:30:19.800
this has really saved me.

00:30:19.800 --> 00:30:21.183
All right?

00:30:21.183 --> 00:30:23.378
The second principle to which
I've constantly returned

00:30:23.378 --> 00:30:26.996
is more important to
me than almost anything

00:30:26.996 --> 00:30:29.184
is the idea that you
can commit an injustice

00:30:29.184 --> 00:30:30.184
by omission,

00:30:31.297 --> 00:30:33.380
as well as by commission,

00:30:34.867 --> 00:30:37.305
and the most `succinct` expression of this

00:30:37.305 --> 00:30:39.945
comes in Nicomachean Ethics 3:

00:30:39.945 --> 00:30:42.018
"Where we are free to act,

00:30:42.018 --> 00:30:44.496
"but also free to refrain from acting,

00:30:44.496 --> 00:30:46.368
"where we are able to say, 'No,'

00:30:46.368 --> 00:30:49.332
"we are also able to say, 'Yes.'

00:30:49.332 --> 00:30:51.692
"If therefore, we're
responsible for doing a thing,

00:30:51.692 --> 00:30:53.315
"when to do it is right,

00:30:53.315 --> 00:30:57.012
"we are also responsible for not doing it,

00:30:57.012 --> 00:31:00.222
"when not to do it is wrong."

00:31:00.222 --> 00:31:02.945
And this to me vital ethical principle

00:31:02.945 --> 00:31:04.891
is rarely invoked these days,

00:31:04.891 --> 00:31:06.434
except in the sole area

00:31:06.434 --> 00:31:08.146
where the public is routinely invited

00:31:08.146 --> 00:31:09.609
to think about moral choices,

00:31:09.609 --> 00:31:11.399
which is medical ethics.

00:31:11.399 --> 00:31:13.510
And so people talk about it

00:31:13.510 --> 00:31:15.095
on the question of the morality of

00:31:15.095 --> 00:31:18.224
withholding medical treatment and so on,

00:31:18.224 --> 00:31:20.011
but I think it has far more to offer,

00:31:20.011 --> 00:31:23.221
far too much of our public
morality these days,

00:31:23.221 --> 00:31:25.904
especially as regards
people who want to wield

00:31:25.904 --> 00:31:28.097
executive power over us,

00:31:28.097 --> 00:31:31.123
revolves around asking if
they've ever slipped up.

00:31:31.123 --> 00:31:32.015
Certainly in Britain,

00:31:32.015 --> 00:31:35.991
it's all, they've managed
to keep their nose clean.

00:31:35.991 --> 00:31:38.832
We never ask enough what politicians,

00:31:38.832 --> 00:31:42.495
presidents of universities,
funding councils,

00:31:42.495 --> 00:31:44.078
successful bankers,

00:31:45.336 --> 00:31:46.836
have failed to do,

00:31:48.017 --> 00:31:50.575
and how they've just abnegated
the duties of leadership.

00:31:50.575 --> 00:31:52.492
I want positive C.V.'s.

00:31:53.344 --> 00:31:56.233
Now Aristotle's anniversary's
coming over a time

00:31:56.233 --> 00:31:59.203
when there's been a pronounced
and surprising revival

00:31:59.203 --> 00:32:01.234
of interest in his thought.

00:32:01.234 --> 00:32:05.349
Alfredo Marcos' 2012 Postmodern Aristotle

00:32:05.349 --> 00:32:07.748
has given us what G.E.R. Lloyd calls

00:32:07.748 --> 00:32:10.745
"a picture of a flexible
and `multifaceted` Aristotle

00:32:10.745 --> 00:32:13.197
"who has lively contributions to make

00:32:13.197 --> 00:32:16.036
"to many of today's on-going
philosophical controversies."

00:32:16.036 --> 00:32:17.582
Absolutely.

00:32:17.582 --> 00:32:20.017
And these include controversies
which have grown out of

00:32:20.017 --> 00:32:23.059
and responded to C.S. Peirce Semiotics,

00:32:23.059 --> 00:32:25.047
Gadamer's Hermeneutics,

00:32:25.047 --> 00:32:27.402
Alasdair MacIntyre's Virtue Ethics,

00:32:27.402 --> 00:32:30.369
Martha Nussbaum's Moral Particularism,

00:32:30.369 --> 00:32:32.987
and The New Rhetoric of Legal Philosophy

00:32:32.987 --> 00:32:34.487
of Chaim Perelman.

00:32:35.709 --> 00:32:37.944
Thinker's discontent

00:32:37.944 --> 00:32:40.911
with Hume's Subordination
of Reason to Desire

00:32:40.911 --> 00:32:44.040
and Kantian abstractions
are very attractive,

00:32:44.040 --> 00:32:47.128
carried on by Aristotle's
idea of learn-able

00:32:47.128 --> 00:32:49.363
moral life skills,

00:32:49.363 --> 00:32:53.507
involving deliberation and
application in practice,

00:32:53.507 --> 00:32:55.757
phonesis, practical wisdom.

00:32:56.632 --> 00:32:59.106
And you get better at it as
you go along is the idea,

00:32:59.106 --> 00:33:01.139
it's cumulative.

00:33:01.139 --> 00:33:03.493
Now we all know that
Aristotle's writings are unified

00:33:03.493 --> 00:33:06.789
by the basic methods of
reasoning he evolved,

00:33:06.789 --> 00:33:08.857
expressed in the group of works on logic,

00:33:08.857 --> 00:33:11.167
which subsequent ancient
philosophers put together

00:33:11.167 --> 00:33:14.540
and called his Organon, Instrument.

00:33:14.540 --> 00:33:16.856
And these monopolized the entire history

00:33:16.856 --> 00:33:18.401
of philosophical logic

00:33:18.401 --> 00:33:20.471
until the critiques by Gottlob Frege

00:33:20.471 --> 00:33:22.418
and Bertrand Russell.

00:33:22.418 --> 00:33:25.099
And some philosophers are rehabilitating

00:33:25.099 --> 00:33:27.332
many of his concepts today.

00:33:27.332 --> 00:33:28.798
It's certainly still astonishing

00:33:28.798 --> 00:33:30.422
that he could take the very methods of

00:33:30.422 --> 00:33:31.559
philosophical reason,

00:33:31.559 --> 00:33:34.193
which he found in Plato
and his predecessors

00:33:34.193 --> 00:33:36.707
and treat the actual inferential systems

00:33:36.707 --> 00:33:39.757
as a topic of analysis themselves.

00:33:39.757 --> 00:33:42.109
He wasn't only interested
in what made the world work

00:33:42.109 --> 00:33:43.205
in the way that it did,

00:33:43.205 --> 00:33:46.109
but in the exact form of arguments

00:33:46.109 --> 00:33:48.541
on which thinkers based their conclusions

00:33:48.541 --> 00:33:49.799
about the world.

00:33:49.799 --> 00:33:52.235
So, philosophy itself
have become the object

00:33:52.235 --> 00:33:54.402
of philosophical analysis.

00:33:57.106 --> 00:33:59.098
Now, it's no coincidence that

00:33:59.098 --> 00:34:00.842
this philosopher-scientist came from

00:34:00.842 --> 00:34:02.263
a medical family.

00:34:02.263 --> 00:34:04.664
Since it was the Hippocratic doctors

00:34:04.664 --> 00:34:06.936
who produced the only
really methodical study

00:34:06.936 --> 00:34:10.145
of living bodies by the 4th century,

00:34:10.145 --> 00:34:13.801
and Aristotle undertook a
systematic and astonishingly

00:34:13.801 --> 00:34:16.031
comprehensive study of animals,

00:34:16.031 --> 00:34:17.816
which also functions to explain

00:34:17.816 --> 00:34:21.800
his self-consciously
applied analytical method.

00:34:21.800 --> 00:34:24.036
And it wasn't until the
European Renaissance

00:34:24.036 --> 00:34:26.469
that any comparable
contribution to zoology

00:34:26.469 --> 00:34:28.337
was ever produced.

00:34:28.337 --> 00:34:31.426
I've heard biologists at my institution

00:34:31.426 --> 00:34:34.351
make similar statements
to the Victorian anatomist

00:34:34.351 --> 00:34:35.813
Richard Owen,

00:34:35.813 --> 00:34:39.308
who said, "Zoological science
sprang from Aristotle's

00:34:39.308 --> 00:34:43.211
"labors like Minerva from the head of Jove

00:34:43.211 --> 00:34:46.584
"in a state of noble
and splendid maturity."

00:34:46.584 --> 00:34:48.943
Aristotle has been `recuperated` widely in

00:34:48.943 --> 00:34:50.482
scientific fields.

00:34:50.482 --> 00:34:54.100
An important example is
Conrad Hal Waddington,

00:34:54.100 --> 00:34:57.432
whose concept of the
Epigenetic landscapes,

00:34:57.432 --> 00:35:00.726
which underlies evolutionary
developmental biology

00:35:00.726 --> 00:35:03.096
owes much as to Aristotle.

00:35:03.096 --> 00:35:05.536
And in Economics, the Social science,

00:35:05.536 --> 00:35:08.988
Amartya Sen has openly
acknowledged Aristotle was

00:35:08.988 --> 00:35:12.645
an important inspiration in
his capabilities approach

00:35:12.645 --> 00:35:15.312
and the human development index.

00:35:17.399 --> 00:35:20.366
Aristotle's multi-disciplinary
treatises contained

00:35:20.366 --> 00:35:23.494
dazzling moments of what I
think might be better called

00:35:23.494 --> 00:35:25.683
"trans-disciplinary thought,"

00:35:25.683 --> 00:35:29.337
where we indeed see a creative opportunity

00:35:29.337 --> 00:35:32.098
produced by Snow's idea
of the clashing point

00:35:32.098 --> 00:35:34.496
between the galaxies.

00:35:34.496 --> 00:35:36.690
Aristotle took an intense interest

00:35:36.690 --> 00:35:38.027
in the world around him

00:35:38.027 --> 00:35:39.530
and practical crafts,

00:35:39.530 --> 00:35:41.565
which I find very touching.

00:35:41.565 --> 00:35:44.329
He sometimes identified
the most dazzling images

00:35:44.329 --> 00:35:48.066
in one sphere of human
activity and experimentation

00:35:48.066 --> 00:35:50.342
to introduce in the
understanding of another branch

00:35:50.342 --> 00:35:51.398
altogether.

00:35:51.398 --> 00:35:54.693
It's one of the marks of a superb teacher.

00:35:54.693 --> 00:35:57.868
My favorite of all is
probably his illustration

00:35:57.868 --> 00:36:00.471
of epikeia, or equity,

00:36:00.471 --> 00:36:02.871
in the legal sphere,

00:36:02.871 --> 00:36:05.308
and he said that equity

00:36:05.308 --> 00:36:08.361
functions like the special
kind of measuring instrument

00:36:08.361 --> 00:36:09.620
or ruler,

00:36:09.620 --> 00:36:12.132
used by builders on Lesbos.

00:36:12.132 --> 00:36:14.408
He'd seen builders on Lesbos,

00:36:14.408 --> 00:36:17.991
and he's explaining a
jurisprudential idea.

00:36:19.328 --> 00:36:21.562
He says that equity functions like this.

00:36:21.562 --> 00:36:23.308
It's made out of lead,

00:36:23.308 --> 00:36:25.905
and although the measure
of distance or angle

00:36:25.905 --> 00:36:28.218
remains, in one sense, fixed,

00:36:28.218 --> 00:36:29.599
as laws need to,

00:36:29.599 --> 00:36:33.824
if they'd been made out
of long-thinking about

00:36:33.824 --> 00:36:35.693
generalities,

00:36:35.693 --> 00:36:36.953
but in another sense,

00:36:36.953 --> 00:36:39.187
it's adaptable and can bend itself

00:36:39.187 --> 00:36:41.260
to suit the precise shape of the stone.

00:36:41.260 --> 00:36:42.093
Dazzling!

00:36:43.292 --> 00:36:44.757
The first time I realized

00:36:44.757 --> 00:36:46.626
that as a specialist in literature

00:36:46.626 --> 00:36:48.702
I couldn't afford to ignore
Aristotle, the practical

00:36:48.702 --> 00:36:49.837
scientist,

00:36:49.837 --> 00:36:51.785
came in the Poetics,

00:36:51.785 --> 00:36:54.304
and I believe that
Aristotle revolutionized

00:36:54.304 --> 00:36:55.890
the prevailing theory of the arts

00:36:55.890 --> 00:37:00.109
by using observations he's made
during scientific inquiries.

00:37:00.109 --> 00:37:03.118
The Poetics is what remains
of Aristotle's lectures

00:37:03.118 --> 00:37:04.538
on poetry.

00:37:04.538 --> 00:37:07.783
It's most concerned with
tragic and epic poetry,

00:37:07.783 --> 00:37:10.828
and he defends such poetry
against the sustained attacks

00:37:10.828 --> 00:37:12.411
of Socrates,

00:37:12.411 --> 00:37:16.622
at least of Socrates as reported
by Plato in The Republic,

00:37:16.622 --> 00:37:20.455
and the ion, who I prefer
to call Platocrates.

00:37:21.492 --> 00:37:25.759
Platocrates' objections to
epic and theatrical genres

00:37:25.759 --> 00:37:27.020
are several:

00:37:27.020 --> 00:37:30.595
He regards them as feeding the
irrational part of the soul

00:37:30.595 --> 00:37:33.603
and as providing bad moral examples

00:37:33.603 --> 00:37:37.218
in the conduct of both Gods and humans.

00:37:37.218 --> 00:37:39.697
In the discussion of
poetry in Books 2 to 3 of

00:37:39.697 --> 00:37:40.672
The Republic,

00:37:40.672 --> 00:37:42.906
Platocrates rules that no
poets should be allowed

00:37:42.906 --> 00:37:45.468
to perform in his ideal polity unless

00:37:45.468 --> 00:37:47.298
they're singing hymns to the Gods

00:37:47.298 --> 00:37:50.764
or encomiums of virtuous man, oh yawn,

00:37:50.764 --> 00:37:54.099
but he does throw down a
gauntlet asking anyone,

00:37:54.099 --> 00:37:55.806
and you can actually
feel the young Aristotle

00:37:55.806 --> 00:37:57.955
in the room going, you know.

00:37:57.955 --> 00:37:58.930
OK.

00:37:58.930 --> 00:38:00.882
Anyone who's a lover of poetry,

00:38:00.882 --> 00:38:04.859
to present a case proving
poetry can be beneficial

00:38:04.859 --> 00:38:07.659
to the community as well.

00:38:07.659 --> 00:38:09.326
It's pleasurable,

00:38:09.326 --> 00:38:12.861
and I take the Poetics of
Aristotle's direct response

00:38:12.861 --> 00:38:14.283
to this challenge.

00:38:14.283 --> 00:38:16.520
His famous theory of catharsis

00:38:16.520 --> 00:38:18.266
that tragedy actually helps humans

00:38:18.266 --> 00:38:20.544
deal with difficult emotions,

00:38:20.544 --> 00:38:21.764
however that works,

00:38:21.764 --> 00:38:23.515
and I know it's controversial,

00:38:23.515 --> 00:38:25.625
but deal with them, rather than exacerbate

00:38:25.625 --> 00:38:27.127
their deleterious effects

00:38:27.127 --> 00:38:28.873
is a very, very important plank, clearly,

00:38:28.873 --> 00:38:30.374
in that case.

00:38:30.374 --> 00:38:33.053
But the catharsis argument will not answer

00:38:33.053 --> 00:38:35.609
the most intractable of
Platocrates' arguments

00:38:35.609 --> 00:38:36.748
against the arts,

00:38:36.748 --> 00:38:39.272
and that is that they are false.

00:38:39.272 --> 00:38:43.251
The mimetic media, which
used charming arts,

00:38:43.251 --> 00:38:46.698
merely to imitate or
represent people in action.

00:38:46.698 --> 00:38:49.462
They give people false impressions,

00:38:49.462 --> 00:38:51.251
but there's worse.

00:38:51.251 --> 00:38:55.272
According to Platocrates' idealist model

00:38:55.272 --> 00:38:56.572
of the universe,

00:38:56.572 --> 00:38:59.011
what we apprehend by the
senses in the physical world

00:38:59.011 --> 00:39:03.193
is a pale and inferior
imitation of the real world,

00:39:03.193 --> 00:39:06.764
which the real one consists
of eternal and changeable

00:39:06.764 --> 00:39:09.118
immaterial ideas of forms,

00:39:09.118 --> 00:39:11.838
so mimetic art just does,

00:39:11.838 --> 00:39:14.679
offers only a third-class view of reality,

00:39:14.679 --> 00:39:17.596
being an imitation of an imitation.

00:39:18.779 --> 00:39:22.883
Now Aristotle, of course,
does not agree with this.

00:39:22.883 --> 00:39:24.874
He thinks the empirically
discernable world

00:39:24.874 --> 00:39:26.175
is fascinating

00:39:26.175 --> 00:39:29.186
and the systemic study
of it is inherently good.

00:39:29.186 --> 00:39:32.356
He also seems to have come
to the question of the arts

00:39:32.356 --> 00:39:34.306
with a willingness to
be persuaded that they

00:39:34.306 --> 00:39:37.390
haven't much to offer humans.

00:39:37.390 --> 00:39:39.788
He talks about music
being used in the cure

00:39:39.788 --> 00:39:42.021
of the mentally ill.

00:39:42.021 --> 00:39:45.274
A man who had access
to the Macedonian court

00:39:45.274 --> 00:39:46.635
in the earlier 4th century

00:39:46.635 --> 00:39:47.977
will have been exposed to theatrical

00:39:47.977 --> 00:39:49.765
and musical performances,

00:39:49.765 --> 00:39:53.177
and very, very many more
during those two decades,

00:39:53.177 --> 00:39:54.760
studying in Athens.

00:39:56.021 --> 00:39:58.017
Aristotle tackles the allegation,

00:39:58.017 --> 00:39:59.681
that it's a representation,

00:39:59.681 --> 00:40:02.832
an artic imitation of any
kind, visual or verbal,

00:40:02.832 --> 00:40:05.710
is false at best, and dangerous at worst,

00:40:05.710 --> 00:40:08.147
and his instincts for teleology,

00:40:08.147 --> 00:40:10.705
to look for what something is aiming at,

00:40:10.705 --> 00:40:12.615
what it's going to grow into,

00:40:12.615 --> 00:40:13.996
it's telos,

00:40:13.996 --> 00:40:17.698
make him look for the
origin and causes of poetry.

00:40:17.698 --> 00:40:20.094
Very, very famous in the Poetics.

00:40:20.094 --> 00:40:22.614
But it always bears hearing again.

00:40:22.614 --> 00:40:25.091
"From childhood, humans
have an instinct for

00:40:25.091 --> 00:40:26.432
"representation.

00:40:26.432 --> 00:40:28.060
"And in this respect,

00:40:28.060 --> 00:40:31.477
"the human differs from the other animals

00:40:32.844 --> 00:40:34.756
"in that he's far more imitative

00:40:34.756 --> 00:40:37.153
"and learns his first lessons
by representing things.

00:40:37.153 --> 00:40:39.387
"And that's the enjoyment," he says.

00:40:39.387 --> 00:40:41.943
"Pleasure, which fame is always good,

00:40:41.943 --> 00:40:44.110
"if it's done with virtue.

00:40:46.619 --> 00:40:49.281
"What happens in actual
experience?" he says,

00:40:49.281 --> 00:40:50.456
"proves this.

00:40:50.456 --> 00:40:54.604
"We enjoy looking at
accurate likenesses of things

00:40:54.604 --> 00:40:58.021
"which are themselves distressing to see.

00:40:59.645 --> 00:41:01.918
"The forms of beasts

00:41:01.918 --> 00:41:05.335
"or the least regarded being and corpses.

00:41:09.272 --> 00:41:10.729
"The reason is this:

00:41:10.729 --> 00:41:12.356
"Learning things gives great pleasure

00:41:12.356 --> 00:41:14.915
"not only to philosophers
but also in the same way

00:41:14.915 --> 00:41:17.839
"to all people, although
they share the pleasure

00:41:17.839 --> 00:41:19.672
"to a smaller degree."

00:41:20.561 --> 00:41:22.605
Now I'll return in my conclusion

00:41:22.605 --> 00:41:25.693
to the fundamentally anti-elitist idea

00:41:25.693 --> 00:41:27.359
that it's not only lovers of wisdom

00:41:27.359 --> 00:41:29.429
who feel pleasure when they learn things.

00:41:29.429 --> 00:41:31.015
Everybody does.

00:41:31.015 --> 00:41:32.434
But now I want to focus on

00:41:32.434 --> 00:41:34.834
the choice of industritive
example he makes

00:41:34.834 --> 00:41:36.337
when he wants to describe how people

00:41:36.337 --> 00:41:38.370
can learn about things
too unpleasant to look at

00:41:38.370 --> 00:41:39.668
in reality,

00:41:39.668 --> 00:41:41.742
by looking at pictures of them,

00:41:41.742 --> 00:41:43.488
or likenesses of them.

00:41:43.488 --> 00:41:44.952
This is the argument that says

00:41:44.952 --> 00:41:48.115
watching tragedy, which
has things in it that are

00:41:48.115 --> 00:41:51.565
really too painful to bear in real life,

00:41:51.565 --> 00:41:53.353
actually helps you learn about them in

00:41:53.353 --> 00:41:54.288
a pleasurable way.

00:41:54.288 --> 00:41:56.235
Brilliant argument.

00:41:56.235 --> 00:41:57.659
He says,

00:41:57.659 --> 00:41:59.488
and he picks low beasts,

00:41:59.488 --> 00:42:03.020
low animal life forms and human corpses.

00:42:03.020 --> 00:42:05.252
We can learn about these horrible things

00:42:05.252 --> 00:42:06.957
by looking at pictures of them.

00:42:06.957 --> 00:42:08.904
Now corpses are not
particularly surprising

00:42:08.904 --> 00:42:12.116
in a treatise on tragic theater,

00:42:12.116 --> 00:42:15.489
but the low beasts are surely a surprise.

00:42:15.489 --> 00:42:17.481
The adjective he used means something like

00:42:17.481 --> 00:42:20.528
insects or primitive sea creatures,

00:42:20.528 --> 00:42:22.922
and I think he's actually
talking specifically

00:42:22.922 --> 00:42:24.952
about the types of diagram

00:42:24.952 --> 00:42:27.306
which he uses in his Zoology,

00:42:27.306 --> 00:42:29.580
and indeed discusses in parts of animals

00:42:29.580 --> 00:42:32.017
in his so-called Invitation to Biology.

00:42:32.017 --> 00:42:34.984
"Even if an animal is
unattractive to the senses,"

00:42:34.984 --> 00:42:36.163
he says,

00:42:36.163 --> 00:42:39.415
"It will always delight the
person of philosophic bent

00:42:39.415 --> 00:42:40.877
"who looks to the causes of things."

00:42:40.877 --> 00:42:43.152
Doesn't matter how hideous a beast is,

00:42:43.152 --> 00:42:44.488
if you're a philosopher,

00:42:44.488 --> 00:42:46.640
it's gonna give you pleasure.

00:42:46.640 --> 00:42:48.550
He says "you can always learn about it

00:42:48.550 --> 00:42:50.662
"from pictures and you'll
still get pleasure,

00:42:50.662 --> 00:42:54.118
"though it's actually better
to examine the animal itself."

00:42:54.118 --> 00:42:56.599
And he definitely used
anatomical diagrams,

00:42:56.599 --> 00:42:59.523
and Leroi in The Lagoon
has commissioned attempts

00:42:59.523 --> 00:43:01.554
at reconstructing them.

00:43:01.554 --> 00:43:05.554
He wrote an eight-book
work called The Anatomist

00:43:06.629 --> 00:43:08.757
which included diagrams showing the way

00:43:08.757 --> 00:43:11.722
that parts of animals fitted together,

00:43:11.722 --> 00:43:14.440
and in The History of Animals, 525,

00:43:14.440 --> 00:43:16.962
he actually refers to his diagram

00:43:16.962 --> 00:43:19.072
of a dissected cuttlefish.

00:43:19.072 --> 00:43:21.882
Right? Actually says to look
at this bit of my diagram.

00:43:21.882 --> 00:43:24.072
He often appeals to diagrams or tables

00:43:24.072 --> 00:43:25.322
in other works.

00:43:27.201 --> 00:43:29.318
So that's a reconstruction of what...

00:43:29.318 --> 00:43:30.862
(light laughter)

00:43:30.862 --> 00:43:33.302
I had to do it (laughs).

00:43:33.302 --> 00:43:34.803
I had to order cuttlefish

00:43:34.803 --> 00:43:36.753
when I went to Cyprus earlier this year

00:43:36.753 --> 00:43:39.959
in order to see what
Aristotle was prodding.

00:43:39.959 --> 00:43:41.219
I then ate it.

00:43:41.219 --> 00:43:43.169
(light laughter)

00:43:43.169 --> 00:43:44.226
OK.

00:43:44.226 --> 00:43:45.933
But I think that this is
what we're talking about

00:43:45.933 --> 00:43:47.435
in The Poetics.

00:43:47.435 --> 00:43:49.915
Aristotle's use of visual aids to anatomy

00:43:49.915 --> 00:43:51.947
and zoological science helped him arrive

00:43:51.947 --> 00:43:55.697
at his revolutionary
defense of arts utility,

00:43:56.612 --> 00:43:58.763
and there are many
examples of these creative

00:43:58.763 --> 00:44:01.857
intellectual movements in both directions,

00:44:01.857 --> 00:44:05.717
which I'm really writing
about at the moment,

00:44:05.717 --> 00:44:08.599
where his experience as
aesthetician, moralist,

00:44:08.599 --> 00:44:10.959
political theorist, or rhetorician,

00:44:10.959 --> 00:44:13.028
contributes to the formulation of an idea

00:44:13.028 --> 00:44:14.288
in the natural sciences.

00:44:14.288 --> 00:44:15.914
It works both ways.

00:44:15.914 --> 00:44:18.352
But the last one I selected illustrates

00:44:18.352 --> 00:44:19.734
the Aristotelian concept

00:44:19.734 --> 00:44:21.319
with which will be the
focus of the remainder

00:44:21.319 --> 00:44:22.699
of this lecture,

00:44:22.699 --> 00:44:26.866
and it's the idea of dunamis,
or potential within things.

00:44:29.239 --> 00:44:31.190
Dunamis within things,

00:44:31.190 --> 00:44:32.487
your potential,

00:44:32.487 --> 00:44:35.536
which you actualize in
the process of reaching

00:44:35.536 --> 00:44:37.649
your telos, or final state.

00:44:37.649 --> 00:44:40.732
Growing into a fully developed human.

00:44:45.088 --> 00:44:46.874
In The Generation of Animals,

00:44:46.874 --> 00:44:49.110
Aristotle is explaining
how the rule matter

00:44:49.110 --> 00:44:51.343
out of which a new animal is created,

00:44:51.343 --> 00:44:53.215
acquires its form.

00:44:53.215 --> 00:44:55.773
Now he incorrectly thinks that matter

00:44:55.773 --> 00:44:59.266
is provided by female menstrual blood

00:44:59.266 --> 00:45:00.932
inside the mother's body,

00:45:00.932 --> 00:45:02.885
and that the potential form

00:45:02.885 --> 00:45:04.957
is somehow chiseled onto it

00:45:04.957 --> 00:45:06.124
by male semen,

00:45:08.290 --> 00:45:09.123
but,

00:45:10.320 --> 00:45:12.638
where he is really right,

00:45:12.638 --> 00:45:14.176
is that he says that the movement

00:45:14.176 --> 00:45:17.096
which allows the matter
to achieve that potential,

00:45:17.096 --> 00:45:18.964
that sort of activity, the movement,

00:45:18.964 --> 00:45:21.278
doesn't take effect immediately.

00:45:21.278 --> 00:45:23.631
It imparts the potential to the matter,

00:45:23.631 --> 00:45:25.946
but it is no longer in
direct contact with it

00:45:25.946 --> 00:45:27.894
at a much later moment often,

00:45:27.894 --> 00:45:29.642
depending on the length of gestation,

00:45:29.642 --> 00:45:31.143
and all the rest of it,

00:45:31.143 --> 00:45:33.893
when the potential is actualized.

00:45:36.221 --> 00:45:37.760
Semen contains within it

00:45:37.760 --> 00:45:40.198
the movement which will set in motion

00:45:40.198 --> 00:45:41.031
by the mover,

00:45:41.031 --> 00:45:41.948
so the dad.

00:45:42.810 --> 00:45:44.885
The motion can move something else,

00:45:44.885 --> 00:45:46.060
which moves something else,

00:45:46.060 --> 00:45:48.863
and eventually you'll get a new animal,

00:45:48.863 --> 00:45:50.946
maybe a human, depending.

00:45:52.403 --> 00:45:53.257
OK.

00:45:53.257 --> 00:45:57.405
So we've got this idea
of a delayed potential

00:45:57.405 --> 00:45:58.405
taking form.

00:46:00.365 --> 00:46:02.766
Semen contains within it
the movement set in motion

00:46:02.766 --> 00:46:04.391
by the mover,

00:46:04.391 --> 00:46:06.013
and that motion can move something else,

00:46:06.013 --> 00:46:07.275
which can move something else,

00:46:07.275 --> 00:46:08.370
which can move something else,

00:46:08.370 --> 00:46:09.304
and he says,

00:46:09.304 --> 00:46:10.682
this is what he says.

00:46:10.682 --> 00:46:14.599
"This is like the miraculous
automatic puppets,

00:46:15.963 --> 00:46:17.342
"for while it rests,

00:46:17.342 --> 00:46:19.778
"their parts somehow
have the potentiality,

00:46:19.778 --> 00:46:21.323
"dunamis,

00:46:21.323 --> 00:46:23.597
"to move potentially."

00:46:23.597 --> 00:46:26.402
So a puppet of some kind

00:46:26.402 --> 00:46:27.620
that isn't moving

00:46:27.620 --> 00:46:30.620
still has the potential to be moved.

00:46:33.954 --> 00:46:35.133
"For while it rests,

00:46:35.133 --> 00:46:37.326
"their parts have the
dunamis to move potentially.

00:46:37.326 --> 00:46:38.662
"When something external moves,

00:46:38.662 --> 00:46:40.126
"the first bit,

00:46:40.126 --> 00:46:43.959
"then the next part comes
to be in actuality."

00:46:45.502 --> 00:46:47.734
So Aristotle concludes
that semen can provide

00:46:47.734 --> 00:46:50.297
the impetus for something to come to be

00:46:50.297 --> 00:46:54.319
long after the moment it
originally came into contact

00:46:54.319 --> 00:46:55.656
with the matter, right?

00:46:55.656 --> 00:46:56.989
There's a delay.

00:46:57.932 --> 00:47:00.287
Aristotle also sees the material

00:47:00.287 --> 00:47:02.888
as already being designed by nature

00:47:02.888 --> 00:47:05.698
to develop in specific ways in animals,

00:47:05.698 --> 00:47:08.455
where conception takes
only a single instance,

00:47:08.455 --> 00:47:12.270
form only contributes a
final, determining momentum

00:47:12.270 --> 00:47:15.723
to those pre-programmed materials,

00:47:15.723 --> 00:47:18.973
which will subsequently self-actualize.

00:47:20.677 --> 00:47:24.228
He further clarifies this puppet parts'

00:47:24.228 --> 00:47:28.048
potentiality analogy in the next section.

00:47:28.048 --> 00:47:30.527
"As the parts of the animal
to be formed are present

00:47:30.527 --> 00:47:32.777
"potentially in the matter,

00:47:33.942 --> 00:47:36.257
"once the principle of
movement has been applied,

00:47:36.257 --> 00:47:38.004
"one thing follows on the other,

00:47:38.004 --> 00:47:39.503
"without interruption

00:47:39.503 --> 00:47:44.048
"just as it does in the
miraculous automatic puppets."

00:47:44.048 --> 00:47:46.489
Now what I think he's got in mind here

00:47:46.489 --> 00:47:48.600
is illustrated in the influential treatise

00:47:48.600 --> 00:47:51.158
on the canonical problems
attributed to him,

00:47:51.158 --> 00:47:53.759
or to the Pythagorean Archytas,

00:47:53.759 --> 00:47:57.038
but more likely compiled by
an early peripatetic student

00:47:57.038 --> 00:47:58.704
of Aristotle.

00:47:58.704 --> 00:48:01.259
Now this wonderful treatise
describes amongst other things

00:48:01.259 --> 00:48:02.092
gadgets,

00:48:03.047 --> 00:48:05.130
which use friction gears.

00:48:06.178 --> 00:48:08.656
Wheels that can transmit
movement to other gears,

00:48:08.656 --> 00:48:09.739
edge to edge,

00:48:10.646 --> 00:48:12.475
that don't use interlocking teeth,

00:48:12.475 --> 00:48:14.426
like a cuckoo clock,

00:48:14.426 --> 00:48:16.295
but they can just do it by friction.

00:48:16.295 --> 00:48:18.040
You can have any number of these wheels,

00:48:18.040 --> 00:48:21.330
so I could set a wheel moving here

00:48:21.330 --> 00:48:24.134
and provided it was in close
contact with another one,

00:48:24.134 --> 00:48:25.229
and another one.

00:48:25.229 --> 00:48:27.873
So, right on the other side of the campus,

00:48:27.873 --> 00:48:32.040
we could ultimately get
something moving as a result.

00:48:33.925 --> 00:48:37.007
In the mechanical problems,

00:48:37.007 --> 00:48:41.275
we gathered this is used for
objects dedicated in temples,

00:48:41.275 --> 00:48:44.200
with which craftsmen aim
to astonish the viewer,

00:48:44.200 --> 00:48:47.283
so you've got like a statue of Apollo

00:48:48.300 --> 00:48:52.217
popping out of the doors
of the Delphic Oracle,

00:48:54.105 --> 00:48:57.640
when somebody right on
the other side of Delphi

00:48:57.640 --> 00:49:00.070
is underground moving a wheel.

00:49:00.070 --> 00:49:02.875
So rational science is being used,

00:49:02.875 --> 00:49:05.469
actually to feed superstition
in that particular way.

00:49:05.469 --> 00:49:06.808
I'm not elaborating,

00:49:06.808 --> 00:49:08.636
but that's what he's got in mind.

00:49:08.636 --> 00:49:11.969
It's like that delayed relayed movement,

00:49:12.819 --> 00:49:16.312
so Aristotle is experiencing
his everyday world,

00:49:16.312 --> 00:49:19.361
I imagine as a little boy
sitting in some temple,

00:49:19.361 --> 00:49:21.347
watching these things,

00:49:21.347 --> 00:49:24.112
and then when he comes to
try and think about how

00:49:24.112 --> 00:49:26.795
what we call DNA works.

00:49:26.795 --> 00:49:27.730
Right?

00:49:27.730 --> 00:49:29.317
Things are pre-programmed
and you just need

00:49:29.317 --> 00:49:31.387
the moment of conception from them to be

00:49:31.387 --> 00:49:32.554
set in motion.

00:49:33.904 --> 00:49:37.068
It's this trans-disciplinary thinking,

00:49:37.068 --> 00:49:39.589
and in fact, that text,
The Generation of Animals,

00:49:39.589 --> 00:49:41.502
is fundamental to the relationship

00:49:41.502 --> 00:49:45.112
between Aristotle's
philosophy and his biology.

00:49:45.112 --> 00:49:47.431
Sophia O'Connell shows that biology

00:49:47.431 --> 00:49:50.110
has tended to be treated
as rather secondary,

00:49:50.110 --> 00:49:52.427
most philosophers have said
that the real Aristotle

00:49:52.427 --> 00:49:54.011
is philosophical,

00:49:54.011 --> 00:49:56.188
and they object to a methodology,

00:49:56.188 --> 00:49:58.384
which begins with the
investigation of issues

00:49:58.384 --> 00:50:00.376
raised by biological texts,

00:50:00.376 --> 00:50:02.404
and even their attempts to integrate them

00:50:02.404 --> 00:50:05.575
with better known aspects
of Aristotle's work.

00:50:05.575 --> 00:50:07.690
Some start with the promise that insights

00:50:07.690 --> 00:50:09.760
into the really important
thought of Aristotle,

00:50:09.760 --> 00:50:11.587
which is assumed to be philosophical

00:50:11.587 --> 00:50:13.703
can be gleaned from his biology.

00:50:13.703 --> 00:50:16.384
Others speak of reciprocal
influence between

00:50:16.384 --> 00:50:18.130
the two types of text,

00:50:18.130 --> 00:50:20.202
but our Sophia O'Connell argues

00:50:20.202 --> 00:50:22.600
this is still to separate the two.

00:50:22.600 --> 00:50:24.387
It's anachronistic ultimately

00:50:24.387 --> 00:50:25.972
since it's a modern distinction

00:50:25.972 --> 00:50:27.924
between scientific and
philosophical pursuits

00:50:27.924 --> 00:50:30.674
which Aristotle just didn't have.

00:50:32.555 --> 00:50:34.095
Her study is very funny.

00:50:34.095 --> 00:50:36.166
It reveals how philosophers have seen in

00:50:36.166 --> 00:50:39.005
Aristotle's Biology a rather
embarrassing by-product

00:50:39.005 --> 00:50:42.381
of a honeymoon spent on Lesbos,

00:50:42.381 --> 00:50:44.651
and in the case of The
Generation of Animals,

00:50:44.651 --> 00:50:47.169
a tendency to relegate biology to some

00:50:47.169 --> 00:50:49.810
embarrassingly unphilosophical
corner of his mental life

00:50:49.810 --> 00:50:52.571
becomes particularly acute.

00:50:52.571 --> 00:50:56.430
She quotes, "The Lagoon at
Pyrrha on Lesbos was a scene

00:50:56.430 --> 00:50:59.719
"of much of Aristotle's
research into marine biology.

00:50:59.719 --> 00:51:01.550
"One can imagine those of his evenings

00:51:01.550 --> 00:51:04.353
"not spent with his new bride

00:51:04.353 --> 00:51:06.262
"were filled with thoughts
of the philosophical

00:51:06.262 --> 00:51:09.109
"implications of observations
made and collected."

00:51:09.109 --> 00:51:11.463
So why couldn't your bride
be helping him dissect

00:51:11.463 --> 00:51:13.095
a cuttlefish?

00:51:13.095 --> 00:51:13.928
Anyway.

00:51:15.006 --> 00:51:16.426
That is a problem,

00:51:16.426 --> 00:51:18.090
but her fundamental conclusion is

00:51:18.090 --> 00:51:20.324
The Generation of Animals
in its central concept

00:51:20.324 --> 00:51:23.330
of potentiality, showed
that Aristotle himself,

00:51:23.330 --> 00:51:25.606
neither regarded the
study of living things

00:51:25.606 --> 00:51:28.528
to be separate from
philosophical speculation,

00:51:28.528 --> 00:51:31.737
nor did he expect to
settle metaphysical issues

00:51:31.737 --> 00:51:34.432
by only employing abstract arguments.

00:51:34.432 --> 00:51:36.993
He just didn't do that.

00:51:36.993 --> 00:51:40.245
Aristotle used the idea of potentiality

00:51:40.245 --> 00:51:43.409
and its actualization
in works ranging from

00:51:43.409 --> 00:51:48.077
Ethics, Physics, Metaphysics,
to the Soul, the Psyche.

00:51:48.077 --> 00:51:51.862
Dunamis means the possibilities
inherent in a thing,

00:51:51.862 --> 00:51:54.779
which may or may not be actualized.

00:51:55.721 --> 00:51:59.177
"Some potentialities are
inevitably actualized

00:51:59.177 --> 00:52:01.082
"and nothing will stop them.

00:52:01.082 --> 00:52:04.088
"Others need conditions to be right.

00:52:04.088 --> 00:52:07.461
"If the entity in question
is a rationally capable one,

00:52:07.461 --> 00:52:09.450
"for example, a human.

00:52:09.450 --> 00:52:12.033
"It needs to be absolutely...,"

00:52:13.061 --> 00:52:15.905
and he says this in
circumstances appropriate to

00:52:15.905 --> 00:52:20.288
the potency, the dunamis,
the potentiality.

00:52:20.288 --> 00:52:22.890
"And in a condition, which
admits being acted on,

00:52:22.890 --> 00:52:26.591
"You've got to get the
circumstances right."

00:52:26.591 --> 00:52:28.295
In moral philosophy,

00:52:28.295 --> 00:52:29.513
I was very distressed,

00:52:29.513 --> 00:52:31.466
because I think this
biology is extraordinary,

00:52:31.466 --> 00:52:35.284
that all these humans have got
this intellectual potential.

00:52:35.284 --> 00:52:38.784
The idea has been virtually monopolized by

00:52:40.079 --> 00:52:41.867
Catholic moral philosophers,

00:52:41.867 --> 00:52:43.494
who use the idea to argue

00:52:43.494 --> 00:52:45.972
that embryos should never be aborted,

00:52:45.972 --> 00:52:48.287
because they possess, potentially,

00:52:48.287 --> 00:52:50.523
the attributes they will later possess

00:52:50.523 --> 00:52:52.552
in developed form, in actuality.

00:52:52.552 --> 00:52:55.555
That's where Aristotle is cited.

00:52:55.555 --> 00:52:58.996
Potentiality became locked forever

00:52:58.996 --> 00:53:03.221
into the vocabulary of
the abortion wars in 1973,

00:53:03.221 --> 00:53:07.122
when the U.S. Supreme Court
made some abortions legal,

00:53:07.122 --> 00:53:11.268
in its landmark decision, Roe versus Wade.

00:53:11.268 --> 00:53:12.243
It ruled...

00:53:12.243 --> 00:53:13.624
This is the wording.

00:53:13.624 --> 00:53:15.819
"That the state has an important
and legitimate interest

00:53:15.819 --> 00:53:19.517
"in protecting the
potentiality of human life

00:53:19.517 --> 00:53:22.282
"from the 24th week of pregnancy."

00:53:22.282 --> 00:53:26.057
Now I'm not sitting 'round
here taking sides on that,

00:53:26.057 --> 00:53:28.368
but potentiality has
subsequently been discussed

00:53:28.368 --> 00:53:30.193
in relationship to the moral status

00:53:30.193 --> 00:53:31.738
of the unborn child

00:53:31.738 --> 00:53:34.222
by bioethicists,
philosophers, theologians,

00:53:34.222 --> 00:53:36.415
both those who oppose abortion,

00:53:36.415 --> 00:53:37.678
and those, many of whom are, of course,

00:53:37.678 --> 00:53:38.978
openly feminist,

00:53:38.978 --> 00:53:40.846
arguing for women's
right-to-choose whether

00:53:40.846 --> 00:53:43.485
to continue a pregnancy.

00:53:43.485 --> 00:53:46.489
That is where Aristotle's
unbelievably revolutionary

00:53:46.489 --> 00:53:49.656
idea of human dunamis has been locked.

00:53:51.572 --> 00:53:54.006
Now intellectuals on
both sides of the debate

00:53:54.006 --> 00:53:57.298
who carry dunamis in
their conceptual tool kits

00:53:57.298 --> 00:53:59.493
are called upon to comment
publicly on subjects

00:53:59.493 --> 00:54:01.442
such as abortion, cloning, contraception,

00:54:01.442 --> 00:54:04.814
in vitro fertilizations, stem
cell research and the like,

00:54:04.814 --> 00:54:07.314
and their expertise is germane

00:54:08.393 --> 00:54:10.421
where potentiality is
invoked to make moral claims

00:54:10.421 --> 00:54:12.060
about bodies,

00:54:12.060 --> 00:54:14.580
but surely, the potentiality principle

00:54:14.580 --> 00:54:17.714
has a far more `edifying` potential.

00:54:17.714 --> 00:54:18.547
Sorry.

00:54:19.742 --> 00:54:21.853
Catholic moral philosophers have, I think,

00:54:21.853 --> 00:54:24.046
turned potentiality on its head.

00:54:24.046 --> 00:54:27.054
They use ideas about
potentiality to flow into

00:54:27.054 --> 00:54:29.044
fertilty, pregnancy, and gestation,

00:54:29.044 --> 00:54:31.769
rather than, I think, Aristotle
imagined out from them

00:54:31.769 --> 00:54:35.936
to what a human can become as
a developed adult intellect.

00:54:37.924 --> 00:54:40.158
I think he'd have been baffled by

00:54:40.158 --> 00:54:43.369
the rest of the field in
which this extraordinary idea

00:54:43.369 --> 00:54:44.202
is invoked.

00:54:44.202 --> 00:54:47.195
Since for him the central
issue was the development

00:54:47.195 --> 00:54:50.314
of the rational solo intellect,

00:54:50.314 --> 00:54:54.012
for which the embryo
wars have no room at all.

00:54:54.012 --> 00:54:55.757
So, a rather long conclusion,

00:54:55.757 --> 00:54:56.771
but it is the conclusion,

00:54:56.771 --> 00:54:58.801
you'll be relieved to hear.

00:54:58.801 --> 00:55:01.357
Potentiality surely is
relevant to more than

00:55:01.357 --> 00:55:02.535
embryology.

00:55:02.535 --> 00:55:04.688
Potentiality is inherently political

00:55:04.688 --> 00:55:07.162
because it can be used
to formulate, activate,

00:55:07.162 --> 00:55:10.329
or resist particular imagined futures.

00:55:11.221 --> 00:55:15.204
Humans who've been born
also have potentiality,

00:55:15.204 --> 00:55:17.154
and they traveled much
further along the road

00:55:17.154 --> 00:55:20.080
to development of their rational intellect

00:55:20.080 --> 00:55:23.172
than embryos under 23 weeks old.

00:55:23.172 --> 00:55:25.041
If we embrace Aristotle's dunamis,

00:55:25.041 --> 00:55:27.444
and one of the contexts he
found it most fascinating,

00:55:27.444 --> 00:55:29.477
intellectual potentiality,

00:55:29.477 --> 00:55:32.851
we remember that it may
or may not be actualized,

00:55:32.851 --> 00:55:36.060
depending on whether the
circumstances are right.

00:55:36.060 --> 00:55:38.009
Moreover, it's not going to be identical

00:55:38.009 --> 00:55:40.926
in type or quantity in every human.

00:55:42.073 --> 00:55:45.403
Humans, as a species,
undoubtedly, share certain kinds

00:55:45.403 --> 00:55:47.351
of potential; he'd've agreed with that,

00:55:47.351 --> 00:55:49.669
but he saw different categories of human,

00:55:49.669 --> 00:55:52.107
as possessing different kinds or levels.

00:55:52.107 --> 00:55:53.932
For example, children,

00:55:53.932 --> 00:55:55.883
by which he means boys,

00:55:55.883 --> 00:55:58.321
are not yet capable of
rational deliberation,

00:55:58.321 --> 00:56:01.613
but are fully endowed with the potential.

00:56:01.613 --> 00:56:06.529
Women's capacity for
deliberation lacks an essential

00:56:06.529 --> 00:56:10.262
ingredient, this would be
the ability to steer itself,

00:56:10.262 --> 00:56:12.128
and remains underdeveloped.

00:56:12.128 --> 00:56:14.711
Slaves don't possess it at all.

00:56:15.745 --> 00:56:19.205
Now while these statements
seem shocking to us today,

00:56:19.205 --> 00:56:22.377
they do show him assessing
the relative uneven

00:56:22.377 --> 00:56:25.589
and differentiated intellectual
endowments are different

00:56:25.589 --> 00:56:27.537
sets of human,

00:56:27.537 --> 00:56:30.749
and we can be sure that he
maintained individual humans

00:56:30.749 --> 00:56:33.552
also have different potentials.

00:56:33.552 --> 00:56:35.625
Indeed, in Generation of Animals,

00:56:35.625 --> 00:56:37.819
we see him trying to work
out how much is given

00:56:37.819 --> 00:56:40.625
each embryo by an individual father,

00:56:40.625 --> 00:56:43.183
which makes the potential
human individuated from

00:56:43.183 --> 00:56:44.604
other humans,

00:56:44.604 --> 00:56:47.855
so your dad's genetic make-up,

00:56:47.855 --> 00:56:51.349
and how much is simply the
"homo sapiens" species code.

00:56:51.349 --> 00:56:53.182
He wrestles with that.

00:56:54.438 --> 00:56:56.714
Now Aristotle has
recently been recuperated,

00:56:56.714 --> 00:57:00.331
as belonging to the
category of Utopian thinker,

00:57:00.331 --> 00:57:04.434
because his work on ethics
and politics assumes

00:57:04.434 --> 00:57:06.262
that creating circumstances,

00:57:06.262 --> 00:57:09.353
in which humans can flourish and be happy,

00:57:09.353 --> 00:57:11.748
is the goal of human life.

00:57:11.748 --> 00:57:14.748
He also, famously, `envisaged` a world

00:57:16.138 --> 00:57:20.488
where machines could take
over most manual labor,

00:57:20.488 --> 00:57:24.021
thus freeing humans to
devote themselves to

00:57:24.021 --> 00:57:26.705
the contemplative life and
the pursuit of happiness.

00:57:26.705 --> 00:57:28.613
That's a very famous
passage which Karl Marx

00:57:28.613 --> 00:57:31.009
was very interested in.

00:57:31.009 --> 00:57:33.645
The human race today,
despite all our machines

00:57:33.645 --> 00:57:35.187
and robots,

00:57:35.187 --> 00:57:37.623
is still not remotely exploiting its own

00:57:37.623 --> 00:57:39.776
intellectual potential.

00:57:39.776 --> 00:57:42.624
Many billions on the planet
are not put in a situation

00:57:42.624 --> 00:57:47.301
where their mental dunamis
is actualized by education.

00:57:47.301 --> 00:57:49.368
The ecological and
political challenges facing

00:57:49.368 --> 00:57:51.642
the human race have never been worse,

00:57:51.642 --> 00:57:53.877
and it's surely our responsibility

00:57:53.877 --> 00:57:55.586
as professional thinkers

00:57:55.586 --> 00:57:57.168
to address our intellectual energies

00:57:57.168 --> 00:58:00.379
to finding solutions to those problems.

00:58:00.379 --> 00:58:03.060
So, Aristotle is a role
model for all of us,

00:58:03.060 --> 00:58:06.597
in that he saw eudaemonia
as a universal objective,

00:58:06.597 --> 00:58:09.119
and that the project is a collective one,

00:58:09.119 --> 00:58:13.220
requiring associations
between individuals, families,

00:58:13.220 --> 00:58:15.220
and the wider community.

00:58:16.226 --> 00:58:19.070
He even found language
into express a prototype

00:58:19.070 --> 00:58:21.386
of the modern idea of the smart mob,

00:58:21.386 --> 00:58:24.597
a group which, rather than
behaving in the loutish manner,

00:58:24.597 --> 00:58:27.442
often associated with crowds,

00:58:27.442 --> 00:58:30.693
draws on universally
distributed intelligence

00:58:30.693 --> 00:58:32.526
to behave efficiently.

00:58:33.983 --> 00:58:37.519
The idea that Howard Rheingold wrote about

00:58:37.519 --> 00:58:40.037
in Smart Mobs in 2003,

00:58:40.037 --> 00:58:42.721
is about collective intelligence

00:58:42.721 --> 00:58:44.873
and we saw earlier how Aristotle insisted

00:58:44.873 --> 00:58:46.494
in his Poetics that all humans,

00:58:46.494 --> 00:58:50.244
not just trained
philosophers enjoy learning.

00:58:51.855 --> 00:58:53.440
Everybody can enjoy learning,

00:58:53.440 --> 00:58:55.838
even at different levels.

00:58:55.838 --> 00:58:57.176
And that passage--

00:58:57.176 --> 00:58:58.715
It's actually been very, very important

00:58:58.715 --> 00:59:00.382
in feminist history,

00:59:01.558 --> 00:59:04.308
because even in the 17th century,

00:59:05.942 --> 00:59:08.097
people arguing for women's education,

00:59:08.097 --> 00:59:10.129
cited that passage, like Buss or Macon,

00:59:10.129 --> 00:59:12.722
who was the greatest English campaigner

00:59:12.722 --> 00:59:15.282
for schooling for girls,

00:59:15.282 --> 00:59:16.583
cited that passage,

00:59:16.583 --> 00:59:19.433
because it does not confine
pleasure in learning to men.

00:59:19.433 --> 00:59:22.516
It's inspired knowledge-hungry women,

00:59:23.660 --> 00:59:25.397
well, actually all the
way from Christine to

00:59:25.397 --> 00:59:26.659
Piers Ann,

00:59:26.659 --> 00:59:29.384
and Aristotle certainly
formulated an ancestor

00:59:29.384 --> 00:59:31.377
of the idea of collective intelligence in

00:59:31.377 --> 00:59:32.627
his Politics 3.

00:59:34.131 --> 00:59:35.962
"It's possible that the many,

00:59:35.962 --> 00:59:38.688
"though not individually
particularly good men,

00:59:38.688 --> 00:59:40.555
"when they come together may be better,

00:59:40.555 --> 00:59:41.398
"just as..."

00:59:41.398 --> 00:59:42.290
I love this.

00:59:42.290 --> 00:59:45.216
"...public dinners, which many contribute,

00:59:45.216 --> 00:59:48.912
"are better than one
supplied at one man's cost.

00:59:48.912 --> 00:59:50.575
"For where there are many,

00:59:50.575 --> 00:59:52.443
"each individual, it may be argued,

00:59:52.443 --> 00:59:54.354
"has some portion of virtue and wisdom.

00:59:54.354 --> 00:59:55.773
"When they come together,

00:59:55.773 --> 00:59:57.884
"just as the multitude
becomes a single man

00:59:57.884 --> 01:00:00.932
"with many feet and many
hands and many senses,

01:00:00.932 --> 01:00:02.800
"so it becomes one personality,

01:00:02.800 --> 01:00:06.130
"as regards the moral and
intellectual faculties.

01:00:06.130 --> 01:00:08.162
"This is why the general public..."

01:00:08.162 --> 01:00:09.381
I love this!

01:00:09.381 --> 01:00:11.087
"... is a better judge
of the works of music

01:00:11.087 --> 01:00:12.672
"and those of the poets

01:00:12.672 --> 01:00:14.826
"because different men
judge a different part

01:00:14.826 --> 01:00:16.004
"of the performance,

01:00:16.004 --> 01:00:17.792
"and all of them, all of it."

01:00:17.792 --> 01:00:19.959
Very anti-elitist, really.

01:00:21.814 --> 01:00:23.808
Now if I were to place one phrase from

01:00:23.808 --> 01:00:25.876
Aristotle's own oeuvre on his tomb,

01:00:25.876 --> 01:00:27.138
wherever it may be,

01:00:27.138 --> 01:00:28.192
it would be:

01:00:28.192 --> 01:00:31.442
"We have the dunamis theoreticae,

01:00:31.442 --> 01:00:35.376
"the potential to
theorize about the world.

01:00:35.376 --> 01:00:39.238
"We all have the dunamis theoreticae."

01:00:39.238 --> 01:00:40.738
And he, of course,

01:00:43.427 --> 01:00:47.821
provides us with how you
treat a clever child,

01:00:47.821 --> 01:00:49.771
or any child at all.

01:00:49.771 --> 01:00:52.982
He received the right
support for the actualization

01:00:52.982 --> 01:00:56.795
of his `prodigious` intellectual `endowment`.

01:00:56.795 --> 01:00:59.067
Northern Greece had
long produced important

01:00:59.067 --> 01:01:01.297
scientific and philosophical thinkers,

01:01:01.297 --> 01:01:04.262
including Democritus and Pythagoras.

01:01:04.262 --> 01:01:06.539
Medicine had been practiced
to a high level there,

01:01:06.539 --> 01:01:08.694
since long before Aristotle's father

01:01:08.694 --> 01:01:10.140
trained as a physician.

01:01:10.140 --> 01:01:11.887
As he grew to adulthood,

01:01:11.887 --> 01:01:14.326
he had contact with the Macedonian court,

01:01:14.326 --> 01:01:16.482
to which the kings invited
the most innovative,

01:01:16.482 --> 01:01:21.477
inventive scientists,
shipwrights, military experts,

01:01:21.477 --> 01:01:24.281
and artists in the world, known world.

01:01:24.281 --> 01:01:26.188
He studied with the best
philosopher of his day

01:01:26.188 --> 01:01:28.017
at the Academy in Athens.

01:01:28.017 --> 01:01:30.047
In Lesbos, he lived beside the lagoon

01:01:30.047 --> 01:01:31.633
and talked to Theophrastus,

01:01:31.633 --> 01:01:33.823
who actually had great local expertise,

01:01:33.823 --> 01:01:35.450
he's a Lesbian,

01:01:35.450 --> 01:01:38.248
as a native of that island.

01:01:38.248 --> 01:01:39.997
Aristotle remained in close contact

01:01:39.997 --> 01:01:43.329
with Alexander's armies
as they went eastward,

01:01:43.329 --> 01:01:45.726
probably receiving
regular reports of natural

01:01:45.726 --> 01:01:48.606
and social phenomena from
his great-grand nephew

01:01:48.606 --> 01:01:49.905
Calisthenes,

01:01:49.905 --> 01:01:53.405
who actually went on Alexander's campaign.

01:01:55.226 --> 01:01:56.444
Aristotle...

01:01:56.444 --> 01:01:58.801
I love this, when I really
started thinking through it.

01:01:58.801 --> 01:02:01.443
... compared political systems
from more direct experience

01:02:01.443 --> 01:02:02.943
than most people.

01:02:02.943 --> 01:02:05.993
He'd lived under democracy at Athens,

01:02:05.993 --> 01:02:08.594
under monarchy, with Hermias the Tyrant,

01:02:08.594 --> 01:02:11.073
in Lesbos, probably, under oligarchy,

01:02:11.073 --> 01:02:12.824
and after Alexander's conquest,

01:02:12.824 --> 01:02:14.937
seen a larger empire than ever before

01:02:14.937 --> 01:02:16.686
come into the hands of just one man.

01:02:16.686 --> 01:02:19.082
He knew whereof he spoke.

01:02:19.082 --> 01:02:20.947
Now did Aristotle ever regret the waste

01:02:20.947 --> 01:02:22.816
of human intellectual potential,

01:02:22.816 --> 01:02:25.012
in a world where most people's dunamis

01:02:25.012 --> 01:02:26.558
is never fully actualized?

01:02:26.558 --> 01:02:27.979
'Cause I certainly do.

01:02:27.979 --> 01:02:28.990
We don't know.

01:02:28.990 --> 01:02:30.654
If he wrote a treatise on education,

01:02:30.654 --> 01:02:32.239
it hasn't survived.

01:02:32.239 --> 01:02:34.107
What we have of his views is scattered

01:02:34.107 --> 01:02:38.094
in his ethical, political,
and rhetorical works,

01:02:38.094 --> 01:02:41.426
in particular the eighth
book of his politics.

01:02:41.426 --> 01:02:43.376
Now most of this
unfinished book is devoted

01:02:43.376 --> 01:02:45.042
to the precise curriculum,

01:02:45.042 --> 01:02:48.253
which should be offered
to upper class boys,

01:02:48.253 --> 01:02:50.447
but despite the elitist focus,

01:02:50.447 --> 01:02:52.765
he sounds intensely modern.

01:02:52.765 --> 01:02:54.757
He opens with his famous dictum,

01:02:54.757 --> 01:02:57.924
"None will doubt that the
legislator should direct

01:02:57.924 --> 01:02:59.346
"his attention, above all,

01:02:59.346 --> 01:03:01.215
"to the education of youth.

01:03:01.215 --> 01:03:03.897
"The neglect of education does harm

01:03:03.897 --> 01:03:05.730
"to the constitution."

01:03:08.124 --> 01:03:09.952
He means education at all levels,

01:03:09.952 --> 01:03:12.187
from small children
through to young adults.

01:03:12.187 --> 01:03:14.704
He believes it to be of
such fundamental importance

01:03:14.704 --> 01:03:16.250
to the flourishing of the community

01:03:16.250 --> 01:03:17.755
under any form of constitution

01:03:17.755 --> 01:03:19.054
that it must be public.

01:03:19.054 --> 01:03:21.492
We cannot let this be taken over

01:03:21.492 --> 01:03:23.159
by private interest.

01:03:24.703 --> 01:03:26.975
Since the end of the
city-state as a whole,

01:03:26.975 --> 01:03:30.107
is to ensure its citizens
live the good life,

01:03:30.107 --> 01:03:32.545
it's manifest, he says,
that education should be

01:03:32.545 --> 01:03:34.252
one and the same for all,

01:03:34.252 --> 01:03:36.812
that it should be public and not private,

01:03:36.812 --> 01:03:38.807
not as present where everyone looks after

01:03:38.807 --> 01:03:40.591
his own children separately

01:03:40.591 --> 01:03:42.175
and gives them separate
instructions of sort,

01:03:42.175 --> 01:03:44.330
which he thinks best.

01:03:44.330 --> 01:03:47.255
The training and things
which are of common interest,

01:03:47.255 --> 01:03:48.799
the koinea,

01:03:48.799 --> 01:03:51.479
should be the same for all.

01:03:51.479 --> 01:03:54.244
Neither must we suppose
that any of the citizens

01:03:54.244 --> 01:03:55.745
belongs to himself,

01:03:55.745 --> 01:03:56.804
they belong to the state,

01:03:56.804 --> 01:03:59.039
they are a part of the state,

01:03:59.039 --> 01:04:00.826
the care of each part is inseparable

01:04:00.826 --> 01:04:02.491
from the care of the whole,

01:04:02.491 --> 01:04:05.047
so all our young people,
I think, on the planet,

01:04:05.047 --> 01:04:08.172
should be getting, somehow,
something quite similar,

01:04:08.172 --> 01:04:09.755
in basic education.

01:04:11.057 --> 01:04:13.129
The training and things
which are of common interest,

01:04:13.129 --> 01:04:15.207
in our own society,

01:04:15.207 --> 01:04:17.601
this would surely include
those socio-political

01:04:17.601 --> 01:04:19.062
and environmental problems,

01:04:19.062 --> 01:04:21.299
which are becoming so urgent,

01:04:21.299 --> 01:04:24.017
and they should be
basically the same for all,

01:04:24.017 --> 01:04:25.884
so that all can understand the issues

01:04:25.884 --> 01:04:27.596
and engage in fruitful dialogue

01:04:27.596 --> 01:04:30.679
with their fellow citizens over them.

01:04:31.863 --> 01:04:34.113
Oh. I will go back to that.

01:04:35.519 --> 01:04:37.852
Oh, dear, that doesn't work.

01:04:39.461 --> 01:04:42.224
That was a great Aristotle, in that movie.

01:04:42.224 --> 01:04:46.369
Universal education, in the
things which concern everyone,

01:04:46.369 --> 01:04:48.278
would mean maximizing,

01:04:48.278 --> 01:04:52.576
and I think, the possibility
of saving the human race,

01:04:52.576 --> 01:04:55.463
all those brains out
there we're not using,

01:04:55.463 --> 01:04:57.206
and we don't train.

01:04:57.206 --> 01:05:00.210
All that intellectual talent
which is randomly distributed

01:05:00.210 --> 01:05:01.460
in populations.

01:05:03.426 --> 01:05:07.593
We are not maximizing the
possibility of finding individuals

01:05:09.807 --> 01:05:12.446
with the relevant dunamis
to come up with solutions

01:05:12.446 --> 01:05:13.706
to save us.

01:05:13.706 --> 01:05:15.655
And by failing to identify and actualize

01:05:15.655 --> 01:05:17.322
human intellectual potential,

01:05:17.322 --> 01:05:19.804
we are actually placing
shackles on our ankles

01:05:19.804 --> 01:05:23.637
at the starting line of
our race against time.

01:05:24.515 --> 01:05:26.264
And how much wasted mental potential

01:05:26.264 --> 01:05:27.280
is out there,

01:05:27.280 --> 01:05:28.822
is very painfully brought home to me

01:05:28.822 --> 01:05:30.858
at the end of last year in Britain.

01:05:30.858 --> 01:05:32.889
A report compiled for the government

01:05:32.889 --> 01:05:35.326
uncovered the appalling statistic

01:05:35.326 --> 01:05:38.334
that 37% of British working adults say

01:05:38.334 --> 01:05:41.167
their job is completely pointless.

01:05:42.030 --> 01:05:44.427
37% say it's completely pointless,

01:05:44.427 --> 01:05:47.173
about another 37% say
it's pretty pointless.

01:05:47.173 --> 01:05:49.369
(light laughter)

01:05:49.369 --> 01:05:51.276
And one of the phrases used was,

01:05:51.276 --> 01:05:53.634
"Does it make a meaningful
contribution to the world?"

01:05:53.634 --> 01:05:54.732
No.

01:05:54.732 --> 01:05:56.764
I mean, I find that really shocking,

01:05:56.764 --> 01:05:59.887
because, you know, even
making coffee as a barista

01:05:59.887 --> 01:06:02.768
is making a useful
contribution to the world.

01:06:02.768 --> 01:06:05.612
I want to know what the jobs are.

01:06:05.612 --> 01:06:07.645
You know, people need a cup of coffee.

01:06:07.645 --> 01:06:10.084
There's a very, very basic
level that people know

01:06:10.084 --> 01:06:13.584
when their time is being completely wasted

01:06:14.483 --> 01:06:18.018
and it was often used as
torture in medieval times,

01:06:18.018 --> 01:06:21.876
the wheels with nothing
in them that you told.

01:06:21.876 --> 01:06:23.909
I really am nearly done out.

01:06:23.909 --> 01:06:24.885
As academics,

01:06:24.885 --> 01:06:27.526
it is our responsibility
to avoid committing a crime

01:06:27.526 --> 01:06:29.234
of omission.

01:06:29.234 --> 01:06:31.426
We need to take the initiative

01:06:31.426 --> 01:06:34.024
and argue for an education
for the global village,

01:06:34.024 --> 01:06:38.191
which covers the things which
are in the common interest,

01:06:39.387 --> 01:06:43.494
and I conclude, cornily
enough, not with Aristotle,

01:06:43.494 --> 01:06:44.917
because I really mean it,

01:06:44.917 --> 01:06:47.072
with Doctor Martin Luther King, Junior.

01:06:47.072 --> 01:06:49.429
So on 7th of January, 1968,

01:06:49.429 --> 01:06:51.298
a few weeks before he was murdered,

01:06:51.298 --> 01:06:55.465
he delivered a sermon at Ebenezer
Baptist church in Atlanta,

01:06:56.873 --> 01:07:01.131
and it was entitled, "What are
your New Year Resolutions?"

01:07:01.131 --> 01:07:04.058
And he said, "I said to my children.

01:07:04.058 --> 01:07:06.333
"'I'm going to work and
do everything I can do

01:07:06.333 --> 01:07:08.489
"to see you get a good education.

01:07:08.489 --> 01:07:10.341
"I don't ever want you to forget

01:07:10.341 --> 01:07:11.646
"there are millions of God's children

01:07:11.646 --> 01:07:14.450
"who will not and can
not get a good education.

01:07:14.450 --> 01:07:17.012
"I don't want you feeling
you are any better than

01:07:17.012 --> 01:07:18.558
"they are.

01:07:18.558 --> 01:07:21.971
"For you will never be
what you ought to be

01:07:21.971 --> 01:07:24.447
"until they are what they ought to be.'"

01:07:24.447 --> 01:07:25.830
So I don't think any of us in here

01:07:25.830 --> 01:07:28.997
is actually fulfilling our own dunamis

01:07:29.934 --> 01:07:31.394
unless we're trying to make sure

01:07:31.394 --> 01:07:33.752
that everybody else can,

01:07:33.752 --> 01:07:35.701
and I think that's pure Aristotle.

01:07:35.701 --> 01:07:37.743
It's pure Aristotle.

01:07:37.743 --> 01:07:39.695
We can't fully achieve the actualization

01:07:39.695 --> 01:07:43.454
of our own Aristotelian
dunamis academicians,

01:07:43.454 --> 01:07:45.636
until we make part of our work,

01:07:45.636 --> 01:07:47.746
ensuring that everyone else on the planet

01:07:47.746 --> 01:07:49.493
is given the education and the support

01:07:49.493 --> 01:07:53.313
that allows them to fulfill
their theoretic potential

01:07:53.313 --> 01:07:54.734
as well.

01:07:54.734 --> 01:07:58.317
So, in Britain, I've
tried to do work a lot

01:07:59.532 --> 01:08:00.872
with the state school system

01:08:00.872 --> 01:08:03.636
in proactive campaigning
for less parochial

01:08:03.636 --> 01:08:07.205
and more interdisciplinary
school and curricula

01:08:07.205 --> 01:08:10.009
because we will never be
fully what we ought to be

01:08:10.009 --> 01:08:13.346
until they are what they ought to be,

01:08:13.346 --> 01:08:16.762
and I do think that is
fundamentally Aristotle's position.

01:08:16.762 --> 01:08:17.595
Thank you.

01:08:18.552 --> 01:08:20.802
(applause)

01:08:31.561 --> 01:08:34.617
- [Rush] Thank you, some
of Edith, for inspiring

01:08:34.617 --> 01:08:37.419
and challenging, and wonderful talk.

01:08:37.419 --> 01:08:41.444
I'm illustrating the potential
for people to ask questions,

01:08:41.444 --> 01:08:43.396
but if you want to ask questions,

01:08:43.396 --> 01:08:45.793
you have to come to
one of the microphones.

01:08:45.793 --> 01:08:47.537
OK, so don't just shout out.

01:08:47.537 --> 01:08:50.257
You can line up, just like
the Board of Supervisors,

01:08:50.257 --> 01:08:51.840
and, are you ready?

01:08:55.742 --> 01:08:57.489
I don't have a question.
I'm just illustrating

01:08:57.489 --> 01:08:58.709
how one asks a question.

01:08:58.709 --> 01:09:01.459
(light laughter)

01:09:05.578 --> 01:09:06.714
- Thank you, Rush.

01:09:06.714 --> 01:09:07.651
- [Rush] I'll do more than illustrate.

01:09:07.651 --> 01:09:08.908
I'll ask something.

01:09:08.908 --> 01:09:10.291
Edith, that was just stunning,

01:09:10.291 --> 01:09:14.291
and I was so moved by the
dynamism of your talk,

01:09:15.414 --> 01:09:17.037
especially at the end,

01:09:17.037 --> 01:09:19.433
so my question is rather dull.

01:09:19.433 --> 01:09:21.423
It has to do with the cuttlefish.

01:09:21.423 --> 01:09:22.883
(Edith laughs)

01:09:22.883 --> 01:09:26.252
Help me understand how or what Aristotle

01:09:26.252 --> 01:09:30.031
was really doing with the,
why we like to look at corpses

01:09:30.031 --> 01:09:32.105
and ugly little animals

01:09:32.105 --> 01:09:35.481
and how that fits with a larger question.

01:09:35.481 --> 01:09:37.921
Pardon me for the
banality of the question,

01:09:37.921 --> 01:09:40.158
because there's so many
deeper, more interesting things

01:09:40.158 --> 01:09:41.131
you've raised,

01:09:41.131 --> 01:09:42.186
but I thought I'd just start with that.

01:09:42.186 --> 01:09:43.201
- OK.

01:09:43.201 --> 01:09:46.252
So, Aristotle is got to come up with--

01:09:46.252 --> 01:09:48.169
I think he's identified

01:09:49.667 --> 01:09:53.834
the really most challenging
argument of Platocrates,

01:09:55.329 --> 01:09:57.579
that this is a false world,

01:09:59.348 --> 01:10:02.235
the world that we represent in the arts.

01:10:02.235 --> 01:10:05.324
The world we're in is somehow
a lower base and material,

01:10:05.324 --> 01:10:06.588
not as good as the ideal one,

01:10:06.588 --> 01:10:08.838
but then rap's so like Ion,

01:10:12.754 --> 01:10:16.419
or painters or tragedians come along

01:10:16.419 --> 01:10:20.475
and they do a simulacrum of a simulacrum

01:10:20.475 --> 01:10:24.876
and so it's just inherently
about things that's false.

01:10:24.876 --> 01:10:26.096
Yeah?

01:10:26.096 --> 01:10:30.263
So, that's the most difficult
argument to counter,

01:10:31.987 --> 01:10:35.886
because the catharsis is very
good on the idea of the arts

01:10:35.886 --> 01:10:37.797
stirs up your emotions in an unmanly way,

01:10:37.797 --> 01:10:39.828
so he's got that one on that one,

01:10:39.828 --> 01:10:40.661
but on

01:10:43.201 --> 01:10:44.701
mimetic falsehood,

01:10:45.801 --> 01:10:47.790
that's a really big deal,

01:10:47.790 --> 01:10:50.873
and I think he's simply realizes that

01:10:52.262 --> 01:10:56.429
he spent, long before he
has figured out the Poetics,

01:10:57.992 --> 01:10:59.780
which we know from some of the plays

01:10:59.780 --> 01:11:01.607
that he mentions that it
can't be one of his earliest

01:11:01.607 --> 01:11:02.868
works at all.

01:11:02.868 --> 01:11:06.785
He's very much reacting
to 4th century tragedy.

01:11:09.856 --> 01:11:11.523
He suddenly gets it.

01:11:12.822 --> 01:11:16.359
The diagrams from which
he's taught students

01:11:16.359 --> 01:11:18.567
what a cuttlefish is,

01:11:18.567 --> 01:11:21.369
even though some of them threw up,

01:11:21.369 --> 01:11:24.458
when they were faced
with a real cuttlefish.

01:11:24.458 --> 01:11:25.291
Yeah?

01:11:26.197 --> 01:11:28.354
It's just like what happened
when you watch suffering

01:11:28.354 --> 01:11:30.021
in a tragic theater.

01:11:31.235 --> 01:11:34.680
So, tragedy is a diagram of a cuttlefish.

01:11:34.680 --> 01:11:38.847
Tragedy is to art what the
diagram of the cuttlefish is

01:11:39.963 --> 01:11:41.667
to learning science.

01:11:41.667 --> 01:11:42.723
Yeah?

01:11:42.723 --> 01:11:46.341
And that is that
trans-disciplinary thing that

01:11:46.341 --> 01:11:48.424
completely blows my mind.

01:11:49.634 --> 01:11:51.826
It's absolutely brilliant,

01:11:51.826 --> 01:11:55.155
so he doesn't do what most of us,

01:11:55.155 --> 01:11:56.784
unfortunately been trained to do,

01:11:56.784 --> 01:12:00.451
which is only work on
one side of the fence.

01:12:01.944 --> 01:12:03.361
So, you can look.

01:12:04.465 --> 01:12:07.332
The catharsis is more difficult
because then people go

01:12:07.332 --> 01:12:09.567
off on whether or not they had dissection

01:12:09.567 --> 01:12:13.150
of human cadavers, at
this time, and so on.

01:12:14.044 --> 01:12:16.363
I don't think you need to
go as far as that at all.

01:12:16.363 --> 01:12:19.817
You can simply go down to
the Sterepokilae in Athens

01:12:19.817 --> 01:12:23.317
and take a pictures of the battles of Troy

01:12:24.289 --> 01:12:27.051
and Amazons, and people
killing each other.

01:12:27.051 --> 01:12:28.803
Finding a picture of a dead body

01:12:28.803 --> 01:12:30.506
that isn't completely disgusting

01:12:30.506 --> 01:12:32.292
is not such a challenge.

01:12:32.292 --> 01:12:33.349
Who knows?

01:12:33.349 --> 01:12:35.096
Maybe they have got diagrams.

01:12:35.096 --> 01:12:37.575
We don't know how the
Hippocratics learned--

01:12:37.575 --> 01:12:40.133
We haven't got the exact same equipment,

01:12:40.133 --> 01:12:44.300
but we do know that he had
a diagram of a cuttlefish.

01:12:45.823 --> 01:12:49.079
That's why I'm bringing that one in here,

01:12:49.079 --> 01:12:52.124
and he does say in his Zoologies,

01:12:52.124 --> 01:12:54.035
"Look how it's good to learn from this.

01:12:54.035 --> 01:12:56.666
"I draw that you learnt
from the real thing,

01:12:56.666 --> 01:12:57.764
"but you can learn with pleasure."

01:12:57.764 --> 01:12:59.510
He uses the same language,

01:12:59.510 --> 01:13:03.677
so I think that we probably
need to re-read the Poetics.

01:13:04.875 --> 01:13:08.733
People like Josh have been
looking at the political theory

01:13:08.733 --> 01:13:11.138
from a biologist standpoint.

01:13:11.138 --> 01:13:15.533
I think us literary people
need to go read all the biology

01:13:15.533 --> 01:13:16.793
and zoology

01:13:16.793 --> 01:13:18.093
and then come back to the Poetics

01:13:18.093 --> 01:13:22.075
and I think a lot more
will fall into place

01:13:22.075 --> 01:13:26.242
if we see tragedies is the
equivalent of a cuttlefish.

01:13:27.394 --> 01:13:28.814
Does this help?

01:13:28.814 --> 01:13:30.232
- [Rush] Yes, absolutely.

01:13:30.232 --> 01:13:34.046
I think part of the deal
is that it's the diagram.

01:13:34.046 --> 01:13:35.302
- Yeah.

01:13:35.302 --> 01:13:36.766
- [Rush] I mean, the
fact is, that it's not

01:13:36.766 --> 01:13:38.104
the thing itself.

01:13:38.104 --> 01:13:38.937
- No.

01:13:38.937 --> 01:13:39.810
- [Rush] And somehow the fact is,

01:13:39.810 --> 01:13:41.395
I can see it, but I don't vomit.

01:13:41.395 --> 01:13:42.411
- Exactly.

01:13:42.411 --> 01:13:43.508
- [Rush] And there we are.

01:13:43.508 --> 01:13:44.564
- And we can learn about it.

01:13:44.564 --> 01:13:46.068
It might be better to go
and look at the real thing

01:13:46.068 --> 01:13:47.531
to do the learning, you know?

01:13:47.531 --> 01:13:52.283
I'm going to learn about exactly
what violent raping means.

01:13:52.283 --> 01:13:54.720
If I see someone being violently raped,

01:13:54.720 --> 01:13:58.827
but maybe I'd rather go and
watch Sophocles Tiresias.

01:13:58.827 --> 01:14:00.858
- [Rush] So there's a real
aesthetic distance in that.

01:14:00.858 --> 01:14:03.608
I mean, basically.
- [Edith] Yeah.

01:14:05.651 --> 01:14:09.088
It's a brilliant argument for art.

01:14:09.088 --> 01:14:12.088
It's just fundamentally pedagogical,

01:14:13.795 --> 01:14:15.545
in a pleasurable way.

01:14:17.693 --> 01:14:19.683
- [Voiceover] Forgive a
potentially ignorant question

01:14:19.683 --> 01:14:21.511
from the opposite side of the divide,

01:14:21.511 --> 01:14:23.214
and thank you for mentioning
Frege and Russell,

01:14:23.214 --> 01:14:24.758
but Russell's take on Aristotle,

01:14:24.758 --> 01:14:26.870
and I am ignorant about this,

01:14:26.870 --> 01:14:28.861
was very different from yours.

01:14:28.861 --> 01:14:31.218
In particular, his example was

01:14:31.218 --> 01:14:35.074
he claimed that women
had fewer teeth than men,

01:14:35.074 --> 01:14:37.758
because he had never asked
Mrs. Aristotle to lean over.

01:14:37.758 --> 01:14:39.019
- I have an answer to that one.

01:14:39.019 --> 01:14:40.606
- [Voiceover] Thank you.

01:14:40.606 --> 01:14:42.758
- Sorry. Is that what your question?

01:14:42.758 --> 01:14:43.855
OK.

01:14:43.855 --> 01:14:46.457
You lose a tooth with
every child you breastfeed.

01:14:46.457 --> 01:14:47.918
You genuinely do.

01:14:47.918 --> 01:14:50.318
I have had two crowns.

01:14:50.318 --> 01:14:52.151
I've had two children.

01:14:53.569 --> 01:14:56.569
So, he looked in his wife's mouth...

01:14:58.443 --> 01:14:59.787
- [Voiceover] Thank you.

01:14:59.787 --> 01:15:00.845
(laughter)

01:15:00.845 --> 01:15:02.917
Did not cover that one. Thank you.

01:15:02.917 --> 01:15:04.177
- Why not?

01:15:04.177 --> 01:15:06.123
I'm sure he checked it empirically.

01:15:06.123 --> 01:15:07.456
Counted his own.

01:15:08.943 --> 01:15:10.473
(laughter)

01:15:10.473 --> 01:15:12.473
- [Voiceover] Thank you.

01:15:14.535 --> 01:15:16.564
- [Voiceover] Thank you.

01:15:16.564 --> 01:15:20.952
So this is a sort of
just a framing question.

01:15:20.952 --> 01:15:23.148
What you've given us, is, I think,

01:15:23.148 --> 01:15:25.981
a beautiful depiction of Aristotle

01:15:27.455 --> 01:15:31.110
as the kind of stand-alone genius,

01:15:31.110 --> 01:15:32.976
which we agree.

01:15:32.976 --> 01:15:35.899
He's in a class by himself,

01:15:35.899 --> 01:15:38.456
but to what extent is Aristotle

01:15:38.456 --> 01:15:42.522
and especially the idea
of potential, of dunamis,

01:15:42.522 --> 01:15:46.136
only made possible because
of a culture in which

01:15:46.136 --> 01:15:47.435
he emerged.

01:15:47.435 --> 01:15:48.732
So, on the one hand,

01:15:48.732 --> 01:15:51.371
you could imagine for example,

01:15:51.371 --> 01:15:54.620
Thucydides is very interested in dunamis

01:15:54.620 --> 01:15:56.207
as a concept.

01:15:56.207 --> 01:15:58.603
Now I'm not trying to make it one-to-one.

01:15:58.603 --> 01:15:59.983
Aristotle read Thucydides,

01:15:59.983 --> 01:16:01.488
there he got the idea,

01:16:01.488 --> 01:16:02.867
but it's a society--

01:16:02.867 --> 01:16:05.834
It's a culture in which
this idea of trying

01:16:05.834 --> 01:16:10.060
to abstract from what's
actually happening in the world,

01:16:10.060 --> 01:16:12.785
like an actual war where
people are off killing

01:16:12.785 --> 01:16:14.205
each other now,

01:16:14.205 --> 01:16:17.455
and the possibility that makes that war

01:16:18.918 --> 01:16:21.794
or that special kind of war possible.

01:16:21.794 --> 01:16:26.670
So Athens has a certain
new way of forming itself.

01:16:26.670 --> 01:16:28.538
I think for Thucydides

01:16:28.538 --> 01:16:32.705
that creates the potential
for a level of conflict

01:16:33.864 --> 01:16:36.066
that the world had never seen before,

01:16:36.066 --> 01:16:37.978
so he's very interested in

01:16:37.978 --> 01:16:41.349
not just the way power is being used

01:16:41.349 --> 01:16:43.221
in actuality,

01:16:43.221 --> 01:16:46.347
but how do you create
the potential for it,

01:16:46.347 --> 01:16:49.313
and then just more broadly,

01:16:49.313 --> 01:16:51.876
Aristotle lives in a world in which--

01:16:51.876 --> 01:16:56.468
although only a tiny
percentage of the actual human

01:16:56.468 --> 01:16:59.069
potential is being used,

01:16:59.069 --> 01:17:01.993
it's still a bigger tiny percentage

01:17:01.993 --> 01:17:06.261
than most societies that he could imagine,

01:17:06.261 --> 01:17:09.011
so that he has the possibility of

01:17:10.487 --> 01:17:14.654
becoming a philosopher
instead of being a, probably,

01:17:16.139 --> 01:17:19.591
very good, but maybe
not terrific physician.

01:17:19.591 --> 01:17:23.409
So, to what extent should
we think that Aristotle

01:17:23.409 --> 01:17:27.576
is a spectacular result of
a society that had, in fact,

01:17:28.773 --> 01:17:32.352
made that spectacular result possible?

01:17:32.352 --> 01:17:35.185
- Well, I see two questions there.

01:17:36.288 --> 01:17:38.363
One is absolutely, just in terms of

01:17:38.363 --> 01:17:42.670
where does his idea of
potentiality come from?

01:17:42.670 --> 01:17:44.948
I think he does use it in a new way,

01:17:44.948 --> 01:17:46.655
and I think he does
think about all organisms

01:17:46.655 --> 01:17:48.650
as being the position in time,

01:17:48.650 --> 01:17:53.241
where they're changing
in a new dialectical way,

01:17:53.241 --> 01:17:57.074
but the ideas from
Thucydides of human nature,

01:17:59.467 --> 01:18:00.729
without God.

01:18:00.729 --> 01:18:03.004
We discuss how human history
develops without God in it

01:18:03.004 --> 01:18:04.828
at all, yeah?

01:18:04.828 --> 01:18:07.221
And of probability.

01:18:07.221 --> 01:18:11.304
I think it's those two
huge Thucydides actualized

01:18:13.797 --> 01:18:16.281
what was potentially the Greek language

01:18:16.281 --> 01:18:19.450
and thinking about those two in a way,

01:18:19.450 --> 01:18:21.235
that clearly, they're very, very close,

01:18:21.235 --> 01:18:22.492
in lots of ways.

01:18:22.492 --> 01:18:24.808
I've often wondered about
Thucydides hanging out

01:18:24.808 --> 01:18:27.162
in Thrace and what that meant, time-wise,

01:18:27.162 --> 01:18:28.662
but you do wonder.

01:18:31.221 --> 01:18:33.626
Does that answer...

01:18:33.626 --> 01:18:36.264
- [Voiceover] Yeah, once again...

01:18:36.264 --> 01:18:38.620
- The dialectic of individual genius

01:18:38.620 --> 01:18:42.399
and it's a fundamental difference between

01:18:42.399 --> 01:18:44.757
French and British Marxism.

01:18:44.757 --> 01:18:46.503
It's humanism and anti-humanism,

01:18:46.503 --> 01:18:49.918
so all French Marxists used to say,

01:18:49.918 --> 01:18:52.595
"Everybody's just a product
of the material environment

01:18:52.595 --> 01:18:57.552
"and their brain is just
a set of neural responses,

01:18:57.552 --> 01:19:00.763
"and nobody's sort of any
brighter than anyone else."

01:19:00.763 --> 01:19:03.039
The English Left tradition,
out of which I come,

01:19:03.039 --> 01:19:04.131
has always said,

01:19:04.131 --> 01:19:07.008
"Well, actually, we think
individuals can make a difference,

01:19:07.008 --> 01:19:09.313
"and it's sort of the
interaction of them," but what I

01:19:09.313 --> 01:19:10.450
really just believe

01:19:10.450 --> 01:19:12.887
is that individuals
can be utterly wrecked,

01:19:12.887 --> 01:19:15.452
if they're not put in
the right opportunities,

01:19:15.452 --> 01:19:18.869
and I just liked the fact that Aristotle,

01:19:20.936 --> 01:19:25.103
his own life embodies how
you give as much advantage

01:19:26.585 --> 01:19:30.214
as you can to somebody
with egregious intellectual

01:19:30.214 --> 01:19:31.148
talent,

01:19:31.148 --> 01:19:34.276
but there probably were another
20 Aristotles out there.

01:19:34.276 --> 01:19:35.128
Does that...

01:19:35.128 --> 01:19:36.226
- [Voiceover] Yeah, yeah.

01:19:36.226 --> 01:19:38.625
That's great, thank you.

01:19:38.625 --> 01:19:40.613
- I think he was an exceptional person.

01:19:40.613 --> 01:19:41.832
I mean, a lot of people don't like him.

01:19:41.832 --> 01:19:43.622
I like reading him, and when I read--

01:19:43.622 --> 01:19:44.842
When you read On the Soul,

01:19:44.842 --> 01:19:46.395
where he's just trying to
figure out the difference

01:19:46.395 --> 01:19:48.341
between random memories

01:19:48.341 --> 01:19:51.341
and sustained acts of recollection--

01:19:52.404 --> 01:19:56.429
You just think you're talking
to someone in the next room.

01:19:56.429 --> 01:19:59.151
It's just to have a
description of what it's like

01:19:59.151 --> 01:20:02.389
in this society's head, like that.

01:20:02.389 --> 01:20:04.389
It's the most blindingly

01:20:06.409 --> 01:20:08.727
immediate culture I have ever had,

01:20:08.727 --> 01:20:10.269
with antiquity, actually.

01:20:10.269 --> 01:20:11.774
Just him sitting there, saying,

01:20:11.774 --> 01:20:15.024
"What am I doing when I'm remembering?"

01:20:20.672 --> 01:20:23.861
- [Rush] Well, Edith, we can't
thank you enough for this

01:20:23.861 --> 01:20:25.000
extraordinary talk,

01:20:25.000 --> 01:20:28.169
and it would be a great,
great crime of omission,

01:20:28.169 --> 01:20:30.039
if we did not give Edith Hall

01:20:30.039 --> 01:20:32.272
a round of Stanford applause.

01:20:32.272 --> 01:20:34.522
