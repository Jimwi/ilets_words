00:00:01.296 --> 00:00:02.129
- Try to do this.

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:03.213
OK, there we go.

00:00:03.213 --> 00:00:04.531
Good evening and welcome to

00:00:04.531 --> 00:00:06.098
the Marian Minor Cook Athenaeum.

00:00:06.098 --> 00:00:07.767
My name is Michael Grouskay,

00:00:07.767 --> 00:00:10.112
and I am one of this year's Ath Fellows.

00:00:10.112 --> 00:00:12.476
The United States currently incarcerates

00:00:12.476 --> 00:00:14.476
over 2.2 million people,

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:15.992
more than any other country,

00:00:15.992 --> 00:00:19.130
and just under one quarter of the world's

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:21.130
total prison population.

00:00:21.527 --> 00:00:23.684
The United States is also a world leader

00:00:23.684 --> 00:00:26.110
in incarcerated population per capita

00:00:26.110 --> 00:00:30.277
with an incarceration rate of approximately .7%.

00:00:30.937 --> 00:00:34.371
The consequences of America's affinity for incarceration,

00:00:34.371 --> 00:00:36.045
while sometimes intuitive,

00:00:36.045 --> 00:00:38.991
can also be surprising in their complexity.

00:00:38.991 --> 00:00:41.755
Tonight's speaker, Peter Wagner, is an expert

00:00:41.755 --> 00:00:44.123
on prison policy and has helped to shed light

00:00:44.123 --> 00:00:45.726
on some of the most interesting

00:00:45.726 --> 00:00:49.819
and problematic consequences of mass incarceration.

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:52.218
Mr. Wagner is an attorney and the Executive Director

00:00:52.218 --> 00:00:54.160
of the Prison Policy Initiative,

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:56.341
which he co-founded in 2001

00:00:56.341 --> 00:00:58.244
in an effort to spark a national discussion

00:00:58.244 --> 00:01:01.808
about the collateral effects of mass incarceration.

00:01:01.808 --> 00:01:03.831
His transformational report

00:01:03.831 --> 00:01:06.524
Importing Constituents: Prisoner and Political Clout

00:01:06.524 --> 00:01:08.971
in New York launched a national movement

00:01:08.971 --> 00:01:11.113
to end prison gerrymandering.

00:01:11.113 --> 00:01:13.359
Mr. Wagner has also written extensively

00:01:13.359 --> 00:01:17.463
about the exploitative prison and jail telephone industry

00:01:17.463 --> 00:01:20.839
and the implementation of geography-based punishments.

00:01:20.839 --> 00:01:23.195
In recognition of his accomplishments,

00:01:23.195 --> 00:01:24.528
he is the recipient of the

00:01:24.528 --> 00:01:27.709
National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers',

00:01:27.709 --> 00:01:30.746
Champion of State Criminal Justice Reform Award,

00:01:30.746 --> 00:01:33.714
and the American Constitution Society's

00:01:33.714 --> 00:01:36.108
David Carliner Public Interest Award.

00:01:36.108 --> 00:01:38.358
In 2013, he received a J.D.

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:42.676
from Western New England College School of Law.

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:45.448
Peter Wagner's talk is a part of the Race

00:01:45.448 --> 00:01:47.614
and Law Enforcement in America series.

00:01:47.614 --> 00:01:49.482
As always, I must remind you that audio

00:01:49.482 --> 00:01:51.101
and visual recording is prohibited.

00:01:51.101 --> 00:01:53.218
Please welcome Peter Wagner to the Athenaeum.

00:01:53.218 --> 00:01:56.218
(audience applause)

00:02:02.308 --> 00:02:04.471
- Thank you very much for having me here today,

00:02:04.471 --> 00:02:08.029
and for coming to talk about mass incarceration.

00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:10.025
I have three goals for this talk.

00:02:10.025 --> 00:02:11.291
And I'm gonna try to keep this...

00:02:11.291 --> 00:02:15.007
I understand people typically talk for about 45 minutes.

00:02:15.007 --> 00:02:17.797
I'm gonna try to do this a little bit shorter

00:02:17.797 --> 00:02:18.630
so we can have more time

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:20.478
to ask questions and have discussion.

00:02:20.478 --> 00:02:22.382
I think people would like that.

00:02:22.382 --> 00:02:23.235
So I have three goals.

00:02:23.235 --> 00:02:25.369
One is I want to give you a crash course

00:02:25.369 --> 00:02:27.673
in our mass incarceration "system,"

00:02:27.673 --> 00:02:30.503
and I'm gonna use air quotes around the system word

00:02:30.503 --> 00:02:31.794
'cause I'm gonna argue that we

00:02:31.794 --> 00:02:34.127
kinda don't really have one.

00:02:34.143 --> 00:02:36.185
And I wanna help you put all of this into context

00:02:36.185 --> 00:02:39.602
and give ya a taste of why thinking about

00:02:39.626 --> 00:02:41.942
a little bit broader than just one system

00:02:41.942 --> 00:02:43.525
would be advisable.

00:02:43.801 --> 00:02:45.866
I wanna talk a little bit about how

00:02:45.866 --> 00:02:47.252
our system has grown so powerful

00:02:47.252 --> 00:02:49.056
that it can reach out and punish people

00:02:49.056 --> 00:02:50.749
that are not even involved

00:02:50.749 --> 00:02:52.279
in the criminal justice system.

00:02:52.279 --> 00:02:54.303
And then, recognizing that

00:02:54.303 --> 00:02:56.001
a lot of my talk is gonna be a downer,

00:02:56.001 --> 00:02:58.591
I'm gonna talk very briefly throughout

00:02:58.591 --> 00:03:00.269
and then at the end and in the discussion

00:03:00.269 --> 00:03:02.191
about reasons for optimism

00:03:02.191 --> 00:03:04.691
and things that people can do.

00:03:05.176 --> 00:03:06.546
So first, for some context.

00:03:06.546 --> 00:03:08.615
The United States' incarceration rate

00:03:08.615 --> 00:03:10.115
is entirely out of

00:03:12.012 --> 00:03:13.954
comparison with its peers.

00:03:13.954 --> 00:03:15.506
You compare the portion of

00:03:15.506 --> 00:03:18.281
each country's population that is behind bars

00:03:18.281 --> 00:03:20.793
between the United States and all of the founding

00:03:20.793 --> 00:03:24.210
countries of NATO, and it's incomparable.

00:03:24.949 --> 00:03:27.383
The closest one is United Kingdom.

00:03:27.383 --> 00:03:30.340
Denmark, Netherlands I mean is 1/10 as much.

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:34.191
Incarceration in this country is very different.

00:03:34.191 --> 00:03:36.386
Now, let's talk here about California.

00:03:36.386 --> 00:03:37.219
We did this report,

00:03:37.219 --> 00:03:39.938
we compared individual states to other countries.

00:03:39.938 --> 00:03:41.812
And while the good news is,

00:03:41.812 --> 00:03:44.250
is that California uses the prison

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:47.250
less than this country does a whole.

00:03:47.447 --> 00:03:49.069
The bad news is that if California

00:03:49.069 --> 00:03:50.701
was an independent country,

00:03:50.701 --> 00:03:52.212
it would have the second highest

00:03:52.212 --> 00:03:55.129
rate of incarceration in the world,

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:57.170
after the United States,

00:03:57.591 --> 00:03:59.991
and above a country that the State Department

00:03:59.991 --> 00:04:02.628
calls an authoritarian dictatorship

00:04:02.628 --> 00:04:05.961
with human right problems, Turkmanistan.

00:04:06.203 --> 00:04:09.110
And significantly higher than Rowanda,

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:11.501
a country that is still dealing with the aftermath

00:04:11.501 --> 00:04:14.911
of a genocide that killed 800,000 people.

00:04:14.911 --> 00:04:17.494
So again, even on a state level

00:04:17.558 --> 00:04:20.058
incarceration is out of whack.

00:04:20.528 --> 00:04:24.129
And this is your standard incarceration rate,

00:04:24.129 --> 00:04:25.983
so it's a percentage of the population

00:04:25.983 --> 00:04:28.422
that's behind bars, looking at just state

00:04:28.422 --> 00:04:30.575
and federal prisons over time.

00:04:30.575 --> 00:04:33.693
And this is kind of your standard graph,

00:04:33.693 --> 00:04:34.667
and I wanna just kinda go through

00:04:34.667 --> 00:04:36.060
the history here very quickly

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:37.404
for context and then talk about

00:04:37.404 --> 00:04:40.154
some better ways to look at this.

00:04:40.308 --> 00:04:42.460
Okay used to be relatively low,

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:43.620
'bout 100 per 100,000.

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:44.710
It's much higher now,

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:46.236
I don't know if my laser pointer works.

00:04:46.236 --> 00:04:50.132
Alright so little quick history call and response.

00:04:50.132 --> 00:04:53.123
It was relatively low when the data starts in 1925

00:04:53.123 --> 00:04:57.013
and then it's going up in the 1930s a little bit because

00:04:57.013 --> 00:04:58.104
- [Audience] The Great Depression.

00:04:58.104 --> 00:04:59.064
- [Peter] Great Depression.

00:04:59.064 --> 00:05:02.272
Okay and then it starts to go down in 1939 because

00:05:02.272 --> 00:05:03.897
- [Audience] World war.

00:05:03.897 --> 00:05:04.730
- World War II.

00:05:04.730 --> 00:05:05.563
We find something else to do

00:05:05.563 --> 00:05:07.676
with our young men besides locking them up.

00:05:07.676 --> 00:05:10.405
And then it stays really kinda low,

00:05:10.405 --> 00:05:13.275
and then it's going down in the 60s.

00:05:13.275 --> 00:05:15.192
Alright, one guess why.

00:05:16.973 --> 00:05:18.723
A little bit Vietnam.

00:05:19.338 --> 00:05:21.339
My kind of theory, and this has not been ya know,

00:05:21.339 --> 00:05:23.023
fully academically tested,

00:05:23.023 --> 00:05:24.682
but anecdotally I got this,

00:05:24.682 --> 00:05:26.528
the people that were in charge

00:05:26.528 --> 00:05:30.431
of the criminal justice system in this period in the 1960s

00:05:30.431 --> 00:05:32.445
were World War II generation.

00:05:32.445 --> 00:05:36.210
The "we're all in it together, we take care of our brother."

00:05:36.210 --> 00:05:40.377
And they were saying that incarceration was not working,

00:05:40.970 --> 00:05:42.053
so why do it?

00:05:42.234 --> 00:05:44.456
People that were prison wardens at this time

00:05:44.456 --> 00:05:45.394
would do interviews and they'd be like,

00:05:45.394 --> 00:05:47.527
"You could let 95% of my people go tomorrow,

00:05:47.527 --> 00:05:49.757
"and society would be fine."

00:05:49.757 --> 00:05:51.092
This is at a time when comparatively,

00:05:51.092 --> 00:05:52.604
there weren't that many people in prison.

00:05:52.604 --> 00:05:53.967
So wardens were considering

00:05:53.967 --> 00:05:56.634
themselves prison abolitionists.

00:05:57.727 --> 00:05:58.560
And then,

00:05:59.499 --> 00:06:02.582
things start to go up in early 1970s.

00:06:02.681 --> 00:06:03.888
In a few states like New York,

00:06:03.888 --> 00:06:05.365
this is the war on drugs starting.

00:06:05.365 --> 00:06:07.532
But in most states this is

00:06:09.055 --> 00:06:10.825
the baby boom coming of age.

00:06:10.825 --> 00:06:14.113
Young people screw up more and make more mistakes,

00:06:14.113 --> 00:06:16.288
do things that are crime, so like this is actually,

00:06:16.288 --> 00:06:18.772
this first little bump is just demographics.

00:06:18.772 --> 00:06:20.082
When you control for...

00:06:20.082 --> 00:06:22.999
People in their low 20s, it's flat.

00:06:23.632 --> 00:06:26.715
But then, all of a sudden, like 1981,

00:06:26.928 --> 00:06:29.345
it starts to spike and go up.

00:06:29.879 --> 00:06:31.278
That's the war on drugs,

00:06:31.278 --> 00:06:33.066
that's the Reagan administration,

00:06:33.066 --> 00:06:35.993
and then the first Bush administration,

00:06:35.993 --> 00:06:37.671
and then the Clinton administration,

00:06:37.671 --> 00:06:40.200
and it's going up faster and faster and faster.

00:06:40.200 --> 00:06:42.200
This is a policy change.

00:06:42.385 --> 00:06:43.218
Crime

00:06:43.218 --> 00:06:44.051
was higher

00:06:44.692 --> 00:06:45.859
then than now,

00:06:45.900 --> 00:06:49.983
but this is not in any way correlated with crime.

00:06:52.097 --> 00:06:53.264
But what it is

00:06:55.412 --> 00:06:56.508
is in large effect,

00:06:56.508 --> 00:06:58.750
a response to the civil rights movement

00:06:58.750 --> 00:07:02.167
and an attempt to control people of color

00:07:03.114 --> 00:07:05.219
in the same way that Jim Crow did

00:07:05.219 --> 00:07:06.289
and that slavery did,

00:07:06.289 --> 00:07:08.214
except this was done through the crime system

00:07:08.214 --> 00:07:11.797
so that it could be nominally race neutral.

00:07:11.991 --> 00:07:14.011
Because that is when this period

00:07:14.011 --> 00:07:15.277
when we saw the racial disparity

00:07:15.277 --> 00:07:19.277
which always existed in prison, started to grow.

00:07:20.735 --> 00:07:21.568
So this is your standard graph

00:07:21.568 --> 00:07:23.104
that's in every criminal justice textbook.

00:07:23.104 --> 00:07:25.610
And this is both a great kind of big picture start

00:07:25.610 --> 00:07:29.131
but it obscures two really important things.

00:07:29.131 --> 00:07:31.857
One is it obscures who's in prison,

00:07:31.857 --> 00:07:34.431
and what's driving some of these changes,

00:07:34.431 --> 00:07:36.230
which I wanted to go a little bit deeper

00:07:36.230 --> 00:07:37.490
into my crash course on.

00:07:37.490 --> 00:07:39.211
And this is just California.

00:07:39.211 --> 00:07:41.558
This is the incarceration rate,

00:07:41.558 --> 00:07:44.350
so it controls for different population sizes.

00:07:44.350 --> 00:07:46.430
And we can see that African Americans

00:07:46.430 --> 00:07:49.146
are seven times as likely to be behind bars

00:07:49.146 --> 00:07:51.346
in California as white people are.

00:07:51.346 --> 00:07:53.336
Native Americans, more than two times,

00:07:53.336 --> 00:07:56.531
and Hispanics, almost two times as often as white people.

00:07:56.531 --> 00:08:00.448
So, incarceration in California and most states

00:08:01.137 --> 00:08:03.373
is about African Americans.

00:08:03.373 --> 00:08:06.346
And secondly, I wanna break this down.

00:08:06.346 --> 00:08:08.546
Talking about the national incarceration rate

00:08:08.546 --> 00:08:11.486
is kind of interesting from the historical way

00:08:11.486 --> 00:08:12.907
to talk about the 1930s

00:08:12.907 --> 00:08:15.008
and to blur the distinction between some states.

00:08:15.008 --> 00:08:17.462
But, we gotta talk about states.

00:08:17.462 --> 00:08:21.129
And so I broke down here the historical data

00:08:22.187 --> 00:08:24.127
for the three major types of correction facilities:

00:08:24.127 --> 00:08:25.419
the federal prison system,

00:08:25.419 --> 00:08:26.772
which quick it's the bottom line.

00:08:26.772 --> 00:08:28.873
Quick lesson, federal prison system

00:08:28.873 --> 00:08:31.433
in the big picture not that important.

00:08:31.433 --> 00:08:34.945
It gets a lot of attention, not a big deal.

00:08:34.945 --> 00:08:36.868
The top line is state prisons.

00:08:36.868 --> 00:08:40.280
Those are the policies of state governments.

00:08:40.280 --> 00:08:43.060
And then the middle line is local jails.

00:08:43.060 --> 00:08:46.761
Now, local policy is some partially set by states,

00:08:46.761 --> 00:08:50.928
partially set by individual county administrations.

00:08:51.754 --> 00:08:54.963
And there are about 3,300 counties in this country.

00:08:54.963 --> 00:08:56.234
So this is when I say like,

00:08:56.234 --> 00:08:57.987
"Do we have a criminal justice system?"

00:08:57.987 --> 00:09:01.563
not really cause we have 50 states doing their own thing,

00:09:01.563 --> 00:09:05.727
we got 3,300 counties largely doing their own thing.

00:09:05.727 --> 00:09:09.347
So fixing it requires a lot of different entry points.

00:09:09.347 --> 00:09:10.488
Although that said,

00:09:10.488 --> 00:09:12.701
they are all drinking some of the same Kool-Aid,

00:09:12.701 --> 00:09:13.763
there's a reason they all did things

00:09:13.763 --> 00:09:15.147
at about the same time,

00:09:15.147 --> 00:09:16.775
but some of the specific strategies

00:09:16.775 --> 00:09:20.192
are gonna get complicated really quickly.

00:09:20.564 --> 00:09:23.147
But what you gotta know is that

00:09:24.040 --> 00:09:26.355
while the local jails have their own kind of authority

00:09:26.355 --> 00:09:27.820
and some of their own ordinances,

00:09:27.820 --> 00:09:29.908
a lot of the people that are in local jails

00:09:29.908 --> 00:09:32.741
are there for violating state law.

00:09:33.024 --> 00:09:36.191
So it's local officials using their...

00:09:38.721 --> 00:09:40.753
Using their discretion in some different ways,

00:09:40.753 --> 00:09:42.003
but it's again,

00:09:42.216 --> 00:09:44.848
it's state law that's implicated here.

00:09:44.848 --> 00:09:46.396
So again, overwhelmingly this is about

00:09:46.396 --> 00:09:48.385
state policy not federal.

00:09:48.385 --> 00:09:50.027
And let's also be really clear

00:09:50.027 --> 00:09:51.637
that the states are different.

00:09:51.637 --> 00:09:54.185
So the big thick yellow line here

00:09:54.185 --> 00:09:55.973
is the same incarceration rate graph

00:09:55.973 --> 00:09:58.084
I showed you before for the entire country,

00:09:58.084 --> 00:10:00.362
but if you overlay the individual states,

00:10:00.362 --> 00:10:01.852
you say, "Oh wow."

00:10:01.852 --> 00:10:03.996
This graph just overlays five states

00:10:03.996 --> 00:10:06.085
cause it was too confusing when I did them all.

00:10:06.085 --> 00:10:07.707
You see like Louisiana,

00:10:07.707 --> 00:10:09.512
the top line has always used the prison

00:10:09.512 --> 00:10:12.801
more than other states and consistently so.

00:10:12.801 --> 00:10:14.968
You see Alabama is the same,

00:10:14.968 --> 00:10:17.385
almost as crazy as Louisiana.

00:10:18.222 --> 00:10:21.192
But then California was going up really fast

00:10:21.192 --> 00:10:24.309
and then leveled off and is then now dropping.

00:10:24.309 --> 00:10:28.476
New York was going up even faster and then dropped

00:10:29.062 --> 00:10:32.303
further and more consistently over a 15 year period.

00:10:32.303 --> 00:10:35.188
And then Minnesota, a state which always had

00:10:35.188 --> 00:10:36.840
the lowest incarceration rate

00:10:36.840 --> 00:10:38.996
in the country, and still does.

00:10:38.996 --> 00:10:42.112
However, you see it's not making any real reforms at all.

00:10:42.112 --> 00:10:44.827
They're just kind of in a status quo mode.

00:10:44.827 --> 00:10:46.592
This kinda matters cause states are going

00:10:46.592 --> 00:10:49.427
in different directions for different reasons,

00:10:49.427 --> 00:10:50.677
and some of the

00:10:51.472 --> 00:10:52.889
big drop you see,

00:10:53.913 --> 00:10:55.617
almost all of that drop in the overall

00:10:55.617 --> 00:10:59.034
US incarceration rate is from California.

00:10:59.643 --> 00:11:01.964
So California, New York, and New Jersey,

00:11:01.964 --> 00:11:06.047
the three of those together are almost all of it.

00:11:06.092 --> 00:11:08.048
A lot of the especially small states,

00:11:08.048 --> 00:11:10.003
are still adding to their prison population

00:11:10.003 --> 00:11:11.320
in ways that really matter.

00:11:11.320 --> 00:11:13.278
So, it's really important to

00:11:13.278 --> 00:11:15.778
drill down to the state level.

00:11:16.247 --> 00:11:18.203
And to do the kind of painful

00:11:18.203 --> 00:11:20.259
but hopefully helpful kind of big picture view,

00:11:20.259 --> 00:11:23.060
this is data visualization that we made called

00:11:23.060 --> 00:11:24.885
Mass Incarceration: The Whole Pie.

00:11:24.885 --> 00:11:26.629
It's showing all the people

00:11:26.629 --> 00:11:28.893
who are locked up on a given night,

00:11:28.893 --> 00:11:30.726
what kind of facility they're in,

00:11:30.726 --> 00:11:31.724
that's the inner circle,

00:11:31.724 --> 00:11:33.735
and then why they're there

00:11:33.735 --> 00:11:36.461
by category and then detailed offense.

00:11:36.461 --> 00:11:38.794
And what you can see is like

00:11:39.089 --> 00:11:41.294
there's not that many people in federal prisons.

00:11:41.294 --> 00:11:43.961
Most people are in state prison,

00:11:44.251 --> 00:11:45.414
in the blue on the left.

00:11:45.414 --> 00:11:46.247
And

00:11:47.122 --> 00:11:50.789
almost a third of people are in local jails.

00:11:53.402 --> 00:11:55.635
Their time there is short, they don't stay very long.

00:11:55.635 --> 00:11:58.149
People go to jail either because they're convicted

00:11:58.149 --> 00:12:00.177
and they're serving a very short sentence

00:12:00.177 --> 00:12:02.104
or they were just arrested yesterday

00:12:02.104 --> 00:12:03.700
and they haven't been before a judge yet,

00:12:03.700 --> 00:12:05.736
or they've been before the judge and the judge said,

00:12:05.736 --> 00:12:08.248
"You need to get $10,000 bail or you can't go home,"

00:12:08.248 --> 00:12:09.839
and the person doesn't have $10,000,

00:12:09.839 --> 00:12:11.904
but they're not there very long.

00:12:11.904 --> 00:12:14.059
But that's about 1/3 of the people

00:12:14.059 --> 00:12:15.958
who are in a cage on a given day

00:12:15.958 --> 00:12:18.950
are in a jail, and nobody talks about jails.

00:12:18.950 --> 00:12:20.651
And because they pass through so quickly,

00:12:20.651 --> 00:12:24.469
there's twelve million people go to jail in a given year.

00:12:24.469 --> 00:12:26.850
And again, nobody talks about jails,

00:12:26.850 --> 00:12:28.191
it drives me crazy.

00:12:28.191 --> 00:12:29.024
And...

00:12:33.341 --> 00:12:35.438
If we can break this down here,

00:12:35.438 --> 00:12:37.017
I don't know if people can see my laser pointer.

00:12:37.017 --> 00:12:40.177
So this whole portion is 450,000 people that are in jail

00:12:40.177 --> 00:12:43.141
on a given day who have not been convicted of anything yet.

00:12:43.141 --> 00:12:46.883
Only less than 200,000 have been convicted of a misdemeanor.

00:12:46.883 --> 00:12:49.883
So, these are people that are still,

00:12:50.649 --> 00:12:52.369
under the Constitution,

00:12:52.369 --> 00:12:53.786
assumed innocent.

00:12:53.865 --> 00:12:56.460
You know innocent until proven guilty.

00:12:56.460 --> 00:12:57.910
But yet, they're there because

00:12:57.910 --> 00:12:59.396
they can't come up with bail,

00:12:59.396 --> 00:13:02.683
which the median bail amount in this country is $10,000.

00:13:02.683 --> 00:13:05.683
We did an analysis of a kind of rare

00:13:05.713 --> 00:13:07.280
government survey that had this data.

00:13:07.280 --> 00:13:09.780
Of the people who are detained

00:13:09.877 --> 00:13:12.460
because they can't afford bail,

00:13:12.529 --> 00:13:14.571
their median income is such that

00:13:14.571 --> 00:13:17.904
$10,000 is eight months of their income,

00:13:18.392 --> 00:13:21.129
so of course bail is unaffordable for people.

00:13:21.129 --> 00:13:22.979
Because you ask unreasonable amounts

00:13:22.979 --> 00:13:24.464
of money from poor people,

00:13:24.464 --> 00:13:25.626
and of course they can't afford it,

00:13:25.626 --> 00:13:26.689
so then you lock them up,

00:13:26.689 --> 00:13:27.926
and then they lose their job,

00:13:27.926 --> 00:13:28.844
they lose their apartment,

00:13:28.844 --> 00:13:29.677
and you make life worse for them.

00:13:29.677 --> 00:13:33.844
And then at some point, they just have to plead guilty.

00:13:34.316 --> 00:13:35.430
There's two countries in the world

00:13:35.430 --> 00:13:37.835
that use this concept of cash bail

00:13:37.835 --> 00:13:39.105
for people accused of crimes,

00:13:39.105 --> 00:13:42.272
the United States and the Philippines.

00:13:42.719 --> 00:13:45.910
The rest of the world has long since stopped doing this.

00:13:45.910 --> 00:13:48.993
But what's new again about bail is...

00:13:49.016 --> 00:13:49.849
I really wanna bring up the idea

00:13:49.849 --> 00:13:52.101
it's not just that it's rare internationally,

00:13:52.101 --> 00:13:55.856
but that our tremendous reliance on bail is brand new.

00:13:55.856 --> 00:13:58.571
Just like in the incarceration graph,

00:13:58.571 --> 00:14:01.016
I'm tryin' to tell ya that like

00:14:01.016 --> 00:14:03.155
incarceration used to be relatively rare.

00:14:03.155 --> 00:14:05.238
So for your entire lives,

00:14:05.421 --> 00:14:07.230
incarceration has been high.

00:14:07.230 --> 00:14:09.120
Don't assume that it's always been like that

00:14:09.120 --> 00:14:11.537
and that it always has to be.

00:14:11.569 --> 00:14:13.404
I'm older than a lot of you,

00:14:13.404 --> 00:14:14.800
almost all of you,

00:14:14.800 --> 00:14:16.339
and like for my entire political life,

00:14:16.339 --> 00:14:18.529
incarceration has been very high,

00:14:18.529 --> 00:14:22.023
but in this lens of history, it used to be lower.

00:14:22.023 --> 00:14:23.971
It can be lower again, we have this option.

00:14:23.971 --> 00:14:26.618
So, I wanna do the same thing with bail.

00:14:26.618 --> 00:14:28.201
Okay, look at this.

00:14:29.577 --> 00:14:32.660
Virtually all, 99% of the growth

00:14:32.857 --> 00:14:36.672
in the population in jail in the last 15 years,

00:14:36.672 --> 00:14:38.996
is a growth in the number of people

00:14:38.996 --> 00:14:42.413
who are locked up before being convicted.

00:14:43.511 --> 00:14:46.745
This is the direct result of one of two things.

00:14:46.745 --> 00:14:49.143
Either changes in police practices

00:14:49.143 --> 00:14:51.155
and arresting more people for minor things

00:14:51.155 --> 00:14:52.706
where they don't get convicted,

00:14:52.706 --> 00:14:56.873
or arresting people who are actually innocent or whatever.

00:14:57.642 --> 00:14:59.835
And a change in bail practices,

00:14:59.835 --> 00:15:02.159
an increased reliance by local governments

00:15:02.159 --> 00:15:05.521
on bail instead of taking a promise to show up,

00:15:05.521 --> 00:15:06.688
on using bail.

00:15:07.658 --> 00:15:09.261
So that's the change.

00:15:09.261 --> 00:15:10.871
So actually, the number...

00:15:10.871 --> 00:15:14.954
The need to lock up people in jails is apparently

00:15:15.919 --> 00:15:17.086
for convicted,

00:15:17.140 --> 00:15:18.818
has apparently been flat for 15 years,

00:15:18.818 --> 00:15:20.822
but the real growth is in locking up people

00:15:20.822 --> 00:15:22.779
who are still legally innocent.

00:15:22.779 --> 00:15:24.612
Like that's important.

00:15:25.204 --> 00:15:26.264
And just to go a little deeper

00:15:26.264 --> 00:15:27.681
into my pie chart for a second,

00:15:27.681 --> 00:15:30.945
this graphs some detail about kids who are locked up.

00:15:30.945 --> 00:15:33.178
So this is not the 5,000 kids

00:15:33.178 --> 00:15:34.197
that are locked up with adults

00:15:34.197 --> 00:15:36.364
in adult facilities right now

00:15:36.364 --> 00:15:38.872
or the other we don't know how many kids

00:15:38.872 --> 00:15:41.250
who were sent to adult prison when they were 17,

00:15:41.250 --> 00:15:42.991
and are now 25, we don't...

00:15:42.991 --> 00:15:44.459
Actually nobody knows that number.

00:15:44.459 --> 00:15:47.292
This is the 34,000 kids who are in

00:15:47.559 --> 00:15:50.476
something that looks like a prison,

00:15:51.193 --> 00:15:53.225
but for kids on a given night.

00:15:53.225 --> 00:15:55.872
And like most of them are there for non-violent offenses,

00:15:55.872 --> 00:15:59.039
and 7,200 of them are there for things

00:15:59.125 --> 00:16:01.125
that aren't even crimes.

00:16:03.215 --> 00:16:05.138
6,600 of them are for violating some

00:16:05.138 --> 00:16:08.138
technical violation of their parole.

00:16:08.991 --> 00:16:11.606
There's a beautiful article this morning in Mother Jones

00:16:11.606 --> 00:16:14.646
about girls in the criminal justice system,

00:16:14.646 --> 00:16:18.563
about profiling all these kids who are in jail,

00:16:19.218 --> 00:16:20.635
who are locked up because

00:16:20.635 --> 00:16:22.969
they didn't clean their room,

00:16:22.969 --> 00:16:24.870
cause they talked back to their mother.

00:16:24.870 --> 00:16:27.785
These were things that were conditions of their probation

00:16:27.785 --> 00:16:29.815
and the mom complains to the probation officer,

00:16:29.815 --> 00:16:30.648
the probation officer says,

00:16:30.648 --> 00:16:32.375
"is she cleanin' her room?"

00:16:32.375 --> 00:16:33.825
And the mom says, "No,"

00:16:33.825 --> 00:16:34.658
and the probations say, "Alright,

00:16:34.658 --> 00:16:35.640
"well I'm gonna send her to prison now."

00:16:35.640 --> 00:16:36.473
Its like, "Whoa, whoa, whoa,

00:16:36.473 --> 00:16:39.103
"why did I answer this question?"

00:16:39.103 --> 00:16:41.683
So that's 6,600 kids are locked up

00:16:41.683 --> 00:16:42.516
for things that are not a crime.

00:16:42.516 --> 00:16:44.029
And then there's a smaller group

00:16:44.029 --> 00:16:46.363
of what are called status offenses.

00:16:46.363 --> 00:16:48.113
These are things that

00:16:48.561 --> 00:16:51.515
are by definition not crimes for adults.

00:16:51.515 --> 00:16:53.757
So this is kids running away from home.

00:16:53.757 --> 00:16:55.725
This is kids staying out after curfew.

00:16:55.725 --> 00:16:58.018
There's 600 kids who are locked up on a given night

00:16:58.018 --> 00:17:00.655
for something that would not be a crime

00:17:00.655 --> 00:17:01.488
if they were an adult.

00:17:01.488 --> 00:17:03.426
They're essentially locked up for being kids.

00:17:03.426 --> 00:17:07.343
Like this is where society decides to spend its

00:17:07.980 --> 00:17:11.455
its financial capitol, its political capitol,

00:17:11.455 --> 00:17:15.265
its emotional capitol on damaging on a given night,

00:17:15.265 --> 00:17:18.930
7200 kids for doing things that aren't even crimes.

00:17:18.930 --> 00:17:20.561
And that's not even talking about you know...

00:17:20.561 --> 00:17:22.569
What was the real reason that this kid

00:17:22.569 --> 00:17:24.237
was involved in aggravated assault.

00:17:24.237 --> 00:17:26.258
Or why do these kids involve in the drug trade,

00:17:26.258 --> 00:17:27.518
like or using drugs.

00:17:27.518 --> 00:17:29.361
Like that's not even leaving that.

00:17:29.361 --> 00:17:31.875
This is just like this basic base line.

00:17:31.875 --> 00:17:33.958
So if we zoom back out to

00:17:35.874 --> 00:17:37.774
the whole pie of mass incarceration,

00:17:37.774 --> 00:17:40.427
I have to unfortunately step another step back

00:17:40.427 --> 00:17:42.595
and tell you that it's more complicated than this.

00:17:42.595 --> 00:17:45.095
Because this is not the extent

00:17:45.127 --> 00:17:46.233
of our criminal justice system.

00:17:46.233 --> 00:17:49.563
This is the people that are in correctional facilities.

00:17:49.563 --> 00:17:51.530
Actually if you wanna include the

00:17:51.530 --> 00:17:53.373
other kinds of correctional control,

00:17:53.373 --> 00:17:55.777
there's 3.8 million people on probation.

00:17:55.777 --> 00:17:57.017
Some kind of alternative sentence

00:17:57.017 --> 00:17:58.438
where if you violate the rules of

00:17:58.438 --> 00:18:00.785
you can go to a cage, 3.8 million people.

00:18:00.785 --> 00:18:03.466
There's 820,000 people on a given day,

00:18:03.466 --> 00:18:04.966
who are on parole.

00:18:05.063 --> 00:18:06.357
They were in state or federal prison

00:18:06.357 --> 00:18:07.713
and they have a conditional release

00:18:07.713 --> 00:18:09.477
with these conditions on them.

00:18:09.477 --> 00:18:11.591
They can be brought back to prison at any time.

00:18:11.591 --> 00:18:13.523
So there's seven million people that are

00:18:13.523 --> 00:18:16.038
under the direct control on a given day

00:18:16.038 --> 00:18:18.288
of the correctional system.

00:18:19.035 --> 00:18:19.868
And,

00:18:21.948 --> 00:18:23.805
what I think this sets us up to talk about

00:18:23.805 --> 00:18:25.756
kinda briefly is a number of different ways

00:18:25.756 --> 00:18:29.000
in which the criminal justice system has grown so big,

00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:31.325
that it can reach out and punish people

00:18:31.325 --> 00:18:33.604
that are not in the criminal justice system.

00:18:33.604 --> 00:18:35.315
That it can reach out and affect

00:18:35.315 --> 00:18:37.468
other parts of society that you would think

00:18:37.468 --> 00:18:38.968
wouldn't be affected.

00:18:38.968 --> 00:18:40.053
And you know...

00:18:40.053 --> 00:18:42.330
Take my first favorite example.

00:18:42.330 --> 00:18:45.861
The U.S. census each decade counts the population,

00:18:45.861 --> 00:18:47.025
figures out where people are

00:18:47.025 --> 00:18:49.000
for the purposes of political `apportionment`.

00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:51.031
For a purpose of figuring out

00:18:51.031 --> 00:18:53.515
how much representation each community gets

00:18:53.515 --> 00:18:55.339
in state legislatures, and in congress,

00:18:55.339 --> 00:18:56.680
and in county government.

00:18:56.680 --> 00:19:00.180
This is this fundamental building block of

00:19:00.433 --> 00:19:02.720
our democracy that is built on

00:19:02.720 --> 00:19:05.727
an assumption that predates mass incarceration.

00:19:05.727 --> 00:19:07.662
That was designed back when there weren't

00:19:07.662 --> 00:19:09.234
that many people in prison.

00:19:09.234 --> 00:19:10.742
Because what the Census Bureau does

00:19:10.742 --> 00:19:12.318
is they count incarcerated people

00:19:12.318 --> 00:19:15.890
as if they actually lived at the correction facility.

00:19:15.890 --> 00:19:16.725
When there weren't that many

00:19:16.725 --> 00:19:18.549
people in prison, it didn't matter.

00:19:18.549 --> 00:19:21.409
But now when you have 2 million people in cages,

00:19:21.409 --> 00:19:24.324
I mean that's more than the combined population

00:19:24.324 --> 00:19:26.904
of our three least populous states.

00:19:26.904 --> 00:19:28.560
They could have six votes in the U.S. Senate,

00:19:28.560 --> 00:19:30.648
and like nine in the Electoral College,

00:19:30.648 --> 00:19:32.659
if prisoners were configured a little bit differently.

00:19:32.659 --> 00:19:34.596
This is a big population.

00:19:34.596 --> 00:19:35.429
And

00:19:36.885 --> 00:19:37.977
it makes a difference,

00:19:37.977 --> 00:19:39.927
so in the interest of time,

00:19:39.927 --> 00:19:40.760
let's

00:19:41.545 --> 00:19:43.628
use this video to explain

00:19:44.151 --> 00:19:46.077
how it is that our democracy gets

00:19:46.077 --> 00:19:47.763
broken by the census,

00:19:47.763 --> 00:19:50.512
and by having so many people behind bars

00:19:50.512 --> 00:19:54.287
in a system that was never attended to do that.

00:19:54.287 --> 00:19:56.114
^- The Census Bureau counts prisoners

00:19:56.114 --> 00:19:58.580
^just like they count everybody else.

00:19:58.580 --> 00:20:00.949
^But the Census Bureau considers prisoners

00:20:00.949 --> 00:20:04.602
^as residents of the township where the prison is located.

00:20:04.602 --> 00:20:07.184
^Not where they lived before they got convicted.

00:20:07.184 --> 00:20:08.517
^So what you say.

00:20:09.384 --> 00:20:10.526
^The state uses these numbers

00:20:10.526 --> 00:20:13.193
^to determine election districts.

00:20:13.774 --> 00:20:17.057
A senator from a white, rural area with a prison,

00:20:17.057 --> 00:20:19.245
can count the inmates as his constituents

00:20:19.245 --> 00:20:22.756
and therefore increase his political influence.

00:20:22.756 --> 00:20:25.490
Those inmates who are largely of color,

00:20:25.490 --> 00:20:27.407
aren't allowed to vote.

00:20:27.974 --> 00:20:29.986
The senator has no allegiance to them at all.

00:20:29.986 --> 00:20:33.146
In fact, he benefits by voting for laws

00:20:33.146 --> 00:20:35.896
to keep them incarcerated longer.

00:20:35.898 --> 00:20:36.731
The census

00:20:38.133 --> 00:20:39.197
is senseless.

00:20:39.197 --> 00:20:41.280
(buzzer)

00:20:42.734 --> 00:20:46.032
- You know this is not just a dramatization.

00:20:46.032 --> 00:20:47.378
People heard of the Attica prison,

00:20:47.378 --> 00:20:49.256
famous prison in upstate New York

00:20:49.256 --> 00:20:50.089
where there's a rebellion.

00:20:50.089 --> 00:20:52.428
You know this is a man who represented this prison

00:20:52.428 --> 00:20:54.484
and seven others in his district,

00:20:54.484 --> 00:20:55.447
who would actually brag.

00:20:55.447 --> 00:20:56.540
He's glad prisoners can't vote

00:20:56.540 --> 00:20:58.196
cause they wouldn't vote for me.

00:20:58.196 --> 00:21:00.808
And it's also true here in California,

00:21:00.808 --> 00:21:04.975
the way the central valley is dominated by prisons.

00:21:05.550 --> 00:21:06.383
Now to be clear,

00:21:06.383 --> 00:21:08.936
the census is not why we have so many prisons.

00:21:08.936 --> 00:21:11.269
This is how incentives work.

00:21:11.482 --> 00:21:12.446
The prisons were built,

00:21:12.446 --> 00:21:14.247
they created this political incentive

00:21:14.247 --> 00:21:15.752
that supported the legislators

00:21:15.752 --> 00:21:17.296
that were supportive of prisons,

00:21:17.296 --> 00:21:18.815
which gave them extra influence

00:21:18.815 --> 00:21:19.910
in order to push for more

00:21:19.910 --> 00:21:21.074
of what they wanted anyway,

00:21:21.074 --> 00:21:22.571
and diluted the votes of everyone else.

00:21:22.571 --> 00:21:24.079
Particularly the communities

00:21:24.079 --> 00:21:25.307
that incarcerated people came from,

00:21:25.307 --> 00:21:26.915
but diluted the votes of everyone else

00:21:26.915 --> 00:21:31.082
and gave Dale Volker just a little bit extra pull to use.

00:21:31.341 --> 00:21:32.341
In exchange,

00:21:33.962 --> 00:21:35.880
what it gave them was this thin incentive

00:21:35.880 --> 00:21:38.844
to build more prisons and gave the entire legislature

00:21:38.844 --> 00:21:40.953
this huge incentive to not ask

00:21:40.953 --> 00:21:42.977
one very simple question, which is,

00:21:42.977 --> 00:21:45.810
We launched on this big experiment

00:21:45.845 --> 00:21:48.260
to build prisons as a solution to crime.

00:21:48.260 --> 00:21:49.982
What are we getting for that?

00:21:49.982 --> 00:21:51.482
Are we better off?

00:21:51.658 --> 00:21:52.865
And that's a discussion

00:21:52.865 --> 00:21:56.032
that has been postponed in most states

00:21:56.529 --> 00:21:59.657
again, and again, and again in part because

00:21:59.657 --> 00:22:00.969
of the extra influence that

00:22:00.969 --> 00:22:02.474
prison gerrymandering gives to the

00:22:02.474 --> 00:22:04.724
forces of prison expansion.

00:22:06.497 --> 00:22:10.052
I'm totally supporter of the government trying new things.

00:22:10.052 --> 00:22:12.110
The government is entitled to try dumb things.

00:22:12.110 --> 00:22:14.219
The government is entitled to make mistakes,

00:22:14.219 --> 00:22:15.802
but as our leaders,

00:22:15.818 --> 00:22:17.122
I think they have an obligation

00:22:17.122 --> 00:22:20.152
to recognize those mistakes and try something different,

00:22:20.152 --> 00:22:21.830
and to evaluate what they're doing.

00:22:21.830 --> 00:22:23.002
And what prison gerrymandering does

00:22:23.002 --> 00:22:25.160
is it short circuits that process.

00:22:25.160 --> 00:22:28.020
And I wanna kinda like make this like...

00:22:28.020 --> 00:22:30.256
You know I wanna beat this one to death.

00:22:30.256 --> 00:22:33.566
So at the time that I did the New York report,

00:22:33.566 --> 00:22:35.956
most incarcerated people came from New York City,

00:22:35.956 --> 00:22:37.164
the little purple at the bottom.

00:22:37.164 --> 00:22:39.073
A few came from the suburban areas,

00:22:39.073 --> 00:22:40.661
and a small number came from the

00:22:40.661 --> 00:22:43.142
entire upstate region which included these cities.

00:22:43.142 --> 00:22:46.014
But the prisons are overwhelmingly located upstate.

00:22:46.014 --> 00:22:47.995
91% of the state's prison cells

00:22:47.995 --> 00:22:49.908
were located at least two hours,

00:22:49.908 --> 00:22:53.325
and sometime 18 hours from New York City.

00:22:53.573 --> 00:22:55.336
But all the prisons were concentrated in

00:22:55.336 --> 00:22:57.127
seven state senate districts,

00:22:57.127 --> 00:23:00.233
all represented by conservative, white senators

00:23:00.233 --> 00:23:02.276
who supported prison expansion,

00:23:02.276 --> 00:23:05.284
and who controlled the state's committees,

00:23:05.284 --> 00:23:08.284
and the legislature on crime policy.

00:23:11.012 --> 00:23:14.258
And that's how New York state was able to avoid,

00:23:14.258 --> 00:23:15.091
for so many years,

00:23:15.091 --> 00:23:17.565
repealing these harsh Rockefeller drug laws

00:23:17.565 --> 00:23:19.688
which the state had been regretting since

00:23:19.688 --> 00:23:22.077
shortly after they were passed in the early 1970s.

00:23:22.077 --> 00:23:24.637
Now, after all the conspiratorial downer,

00:23:24.637 --> 00:23:26.137
we have good news.

00:23:26.440 --> 00:23:27.450
So some states have fixed this.

00:23:27.450 --> 00:23:28.507
New York passed legislation,

00:23:28.507 --> 00:23:30.406
California, Maryland, Delaware,

00:23:30.406 --> 00:23:32.167
they count incarcerated people at home

00:23:32.167 --> 00:23:34.673
for redistricting purposes now.

00:23:34.673 --> 00:23:36.583
A number of other states have tried to do so.

00:23:36.583 --> 00:23:39.416
Hundreds of rural governments have

00:23:39.469 --> 00:23:41.386
done this on their own.

00:23:41.724 --> 00:23:44.294
So that's good, that's progress.

00:23:44.294 --> 00:23:45.380
It is possible to bring up

00:23:45.380 --> 00:23:47.491
a complicated structural issue,

00:23:47.491 --> 00:23:49.950
get a state to address it and fix it.

00:23:49.950 --> 00:23:51.867
So, change is possible.

00:23:52.662 --> 00:23:53.996
But I wanna shift gears

00:23:53.996 --> 00:23:56.199
and talk about the personal,

00:23:56.199 --> 00:23:59.178
rather than the political experience of incarceration.

00:23:59.178 --> 00:24:01.115
And I wanna start with just a survey

00:24:01.115 --> 00:24:02.339
of data collected from some

00:24:02.339 --> 00:24:04.835
incarcerated parents by the federal government.

00:24:04.835 --> 00:24:05.989
So answer this question.

00:24:05.989 --> 00:24:08.163
Have you been in touch with your

00:24:08.163 --> 00:24:10.184
children in the last month?

00:24:10.184 --> 00:24:11.434
And if so, how?

00:24:11.982 --> 00:24:14.169
70% have done so by letter.

00:24:14.169 --> 00:24:15.501
I just wanna make this really `blunt`,

00:24:15.501 --> 00:24:16.334
letters...

00:24:16.334 --> 00:24:18.602
How many of you know what letters are?

00:24:18.602 --> 00:24:19.435
Let me ask a better question.
(laughter)

00:24:19.435 --> 00:24:20.372
Alright, now we got a laugh out of that.

00:24:20.372 --> 00:24:22.003
Like how many of you have written a letter

00:24:22.003 --> 00:24:24.026
with an envelope and a stamp,

00:24:24.026 --> 00:24:25.127
in the last month.

00:24:25.127 --> 00:24:26.814
Okay not ever, I meant like in the last month.

00:24:26.814 --> 00:24:27.678
I'm just curious.

00:24:27.678 --> 00:24:29.345
Okay, a few alright.

00:24:31.665 --> 00:24:34.244
53% have done so by phone.

00:24:34.244 --> 00:24:36.396
I know you all have cell phones in your pockets.

00:24:36.396 --> 00:24:38.926
And I know we use it mostly for texting.

00:24:38.926 --> 00:24:39.789
How many of you have made

00:24:39.789 --> 00:24:42.009
a phone call in the last month.

00:24:42.009 --> 00:24:42.950
Okay, all of them.

00:24:42.950 --> 00:24:44.617
I know phones you know is not as cool anymore,

00:24:44.617 --> 00:24:46.470
but like alright so there it's less.

00:24:46.470 --> 00:24:48.692
And we'll talk a little bit about why

00:24:48.692 --> 00:24:50.593
that number's only 53%

00:24:50.593 --> 00:24:52.763
And 42% by personal visit because

00:24:52.763 --> 00:24:55.988
they build prisons in the middle of nowhere.

00:24:55.988 --> 00:24:57.578
A majority are at least 100 miles from home.

00:24:57.578 --> 00:24:59.162
It's hard to visit them

00:24:59.162 --> 00:25:00.555
and when you go there it's difficult.

00:25:00.555 --> 00:25:01.388
And...

00:25:03.240 --> 00:25:05.181
So the phone industries this covers

00:25:05.181 --> 00:25:06.406
one of these reports we did...

00:25:06.406 --> 00:25:09.014
So, I got a cell phone in my pocket.

00:25:09.014 --> 00:25:10.377
I have unlimited, long distance

00:25:10.377 --> 00:25:13.377
for some very small amount of money.

00:25:13.411 --> 00:25:15.429
But in a prison or jail it can cost

00:25:15.429 --> 00:25:17.288
up to a dollar a minute

00:25:17.288 --> 00:25:20.032
to receive a phone call from a prison

00:25:20.032 --> 00:25:21.663
because the incentives are wrong.

00:25:21.663 --> 00:25:23.730
This is again like prison gerrymandering.

00:25:23.730 --> 00:25:26.478
You and I choose our cell phones based on

00:25:26.478 --> 00:25:30.645
which company will give me the best deal for the best price.

00:25:31.086 --> 00:25:32.539
And I benefit, I pay.

00:25:32.539 --> 00:25:33.934
The way prisons...

00:25:33.934 --> 00:25:36.577
What they do is they give out a monopoly contract

00:25:36.577 --> 00:25:38.139
to a single company,

00:25:38.139 --> 00:25:40.407
not on the basis of who provides the best service

00:25:40.407 --> 00:25:43.430
or the best price to the families that pay the bill,

00:25:43.430 --> 00:25:45.559
but to which company will charge the most

00:25:45.559 --> 00:25:49.112
and kick back the most revenue to the facility.

00:25:49.112 --> 00:25:51.144
So of course the calls cost a dollar a minute.

00:25:51.144 --> 00:25:54.207
Of course 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 99%

00:25:54.207 --> 00:25:55.178
of the money that's raised

00:25:55.178 --> 00:25:59.345
goes back to the person who gave them a monopoly contract.

00:26:00.281 --> 00:26:02.857
This is like your ultimate short-sided policy

00:26:02.857 --> 00:26:04.857
because you have a state

00:26:05.703 --> 00:26:07.291
that's trying to raise money

00:26:07.291 --> 00:26:10.118
from the poorest residents of their state,

00:26:10.118 --> 00:26:12.623
in a way that screws up the lives

00:26:12.623 --> 00:26:15.684
of some of the most struggling families in a community,

00:26:15.684 --> 00:26:17.194
and then expects people to like

00:26:17.194 --> 00:26:19.719
be successful when you release them again.

00:26:19.719 --> 00:26:21.052
You know this is

00:26:21.426 --> 00:26:24.511
pretty dumb but when you're short-sided,

00:26:24.511 --> 00:26:25.793
it's a pretty easy policy

00:26:25.793 --> 00:26:26.955
to get yourself sucked into.

00:26:26.955 --> 00:26:28.205
Well good news.

00:26:28.663 --> 00:26:31.200
Last year the FCC capped the cost of

00:26:31.200 --> 00:26:32.865
calls that cross interstate lines,

00:26:32.865 --> 00:26:35.836
and they're trying to cap the cost of instate lines,

00:26:35.836 --> 00:26:37.253
of instate calls.

00:26:39.544 --> 00:26:40.377
Some states also have their own

00:26:40.377 --> 00:26:41.654
regulations they're trying to do.

00:26:41.654 --> 00:26:42.934
So there's more and more attention on this.

00:26:42.934 --> 00:26:45.594
You know even Alabama has very strong regulations

00:26:45.594 --> 00:26:47.516
on what the prison phone companies can do.

00:26:47.516 --> 00:26:49.227
And if Alabama can do it,

00:26:49.227 --> 00:26:50.928
every state can do it.

00:26:50.928 --> 00:26:52.621
(light laughter)

00:26:52.621 --> 00:26:54.165
Including California which is

00:26:54.165 --> 00:26:55.969
you know, kinda questionable.

00:26:55.969 --> 00:26:58.737
The state you know did ban kickbacks

00:26:58.737 --> 00:27:00.445
of cash on the phone,

00:27:00.445 --> 00:27:02.211
but the Department of Corrections

00:27:02.211 --> 00:27:05.878
is allowed to demand stuff from the company.

00:27:05.988 --> 00:27:08.101
So they get a lot of technology,

00:27:08.101 --> 00:27:10.647
and cell phone jamming equipment, and so forth.

00:27:10.647 --> 00:27:11.730
And I'll be honest with you,

00:27:11.730 --> 00:27:15.897
how did New York stop their cell phone smuggling problem?

00:27:16.402 --> 00:27:18.775
They passed a law that says the phone contracts

00:27:18.775 --> 00:27:20.068
will be negotiated on the basis

00:27:20.068 --> 00:27:22.530
of a lowest price to the consumer.

00:27:22.530 --> 00:27:24.743
And it cost I think four cents a minute

00:27:24.743 --> 00:27:26.933
to make a phone call from a prison.

00:27:26.933 --> 00:27:28.104
They provide all the security services,

00:27:28.104 --> 00:27:29.534
all the billing services,

00:27:29.534 --> 00:27:32.741
and the actual call for four cents a minute.

00:27:32.741 --> 00:27:34.922
And the very same company charges

00:27:34.922 --> 00:27:36.853
much more in California because

00:27:36.853 --> 00:27:38.355
they're also pocketing a lot

00:27:38.355 --> 00:27:41.613
and because they're giving stuff to the state.

00:27:41.613 --> 00:27:42.754
And as far as I'm concerned,

00:27:42.754 --> 00:27:44.690
you know there's a legal technicality

00:27:44.690 --> 00:27:46.607
but a bribe is a bribe.

00:27:47.045 --> 00:27:48.742
If I give you something of value,

00:27:48.742 --> 00:27:50.334
whether it's cash or a

00:27:50.334 --> 00:27:52.546
truck full of computer hardware,

00:27:52.546 --> 00:27:53.967
it's still something of value

00:27:53.967 --> 00:27:55.630
designed to influence your decision,

00:27:55.630 --> 00:27:57.463
that's how that works.

00:27:57.810 --> 00:27:59.150
So the companies are still fighting

00:27:59.150 --> 00:28:00.215
in the courts and coming up with

00:28:00.215 --> 00:28:01.306
some new products to rip off

00:28:01.306 --> 00:28:02.739
families that we'll talk about.

00:28:02.739 --> 00:28:04.582
But I want to talk about visitation.

00:28:04.582 --> 00:28:06.951
How many people have ever been in a correctional facility,

00:28:06.951 --> 00:28:08.259
either because you're arrested

00:28:08.259 --> 00:28:09.455
or because you're visiting someone

00:28:09.455 --> 00:28:11.163
or you got a job there.

00:28:11.163 --> 00:28:12.105
Alright, raise your hands a little higher.

00:28:12.105 --> 00:28:12.938
Alright, so some people have

00:28:12.938 --> 00:28:13.771
been in a correctional facility.

00:28:13.771 --> 00:28:14.823
How many people have been in a state

00:28:14.823 --> 00:28:16.323
or federal prison?

00:28:17.514 --> 00:28:20.367
Okay, how many people in a local jail?

00:28:20.367 --> 00:28:22.145
Okay, more people in a local jail.

00:28:22.145 --> 00:28:25.078
Let's see how this matches your experience.

00:28:25.078 --> 00:28:27.539
It's very hard to find pictures of visitation rooms.

00:28:27.539 --> 00:28:30.872
This I found on the architect's website.

00:28:31.326 --> 00:28:33.989
This is a prison built in Missouri.

00:28:33.989 --> 00:28:35.852
This is a visiting room.

00:28:35.852 --> 00:28:37.019
Cold, sterile.

00:28:37.303 --> 00:28:39.053
Looks kinda like a...

00:28:41.125 --> 00:28:44.042
Kinda like a bus station from hell.

00:28:44.144 --> 00:28:46.061
But like, this is good.

00:28:47.071 --> 00:28:48.963
Does this roughly match people's

00:28:48.963 --> 00:28:51.296
experience in state prisons.

00:28:51.861 --> 00:28:55.026
A little bit, some a little better, some a little worse.

00:28:55.026 --> 00:28:57.026
They're often like this.

00:28:57.751 --> 00:28:58.724
In jails, where again

00:28:58.724 --> 00:29:01.453
people are serving time for minor offenses

00:29:01.453 --> 00:29:02.286
or for...

00:29:03.690 --> 00:29:06.021
Or they're innocent and they're not convicted of anything.

00:29:06.021 --> 00:29:08.077
They often look like this.

00:29:08.077 --> 00:29:09.520
And this is a prison in...

00:29:09.520 --> 00:29:11.200
This is actually the L.A. jail for women

00:29:11.200 --> 00:29:12.871
that closed about 15 years ago.

00:29:12.871 --> 00:29:14.204
It's now a movie set

00:29:14.204 --> 00:29:15.154
that's owned by the Sheriff.

00:29:15.154 --> 00:29:17.237
The Sheriff rents it out.

00:29:17.237 --> 00:29:18.070
But looks like this,

00:29:18.070 --> 00:29:19.653
you got a phone, you got the glass.

00:29:19.653 --> 00:29:21.320
You got this booths.

00:29:22.078 --> 00:29:23.640
Not very good, you can't see people,

00:29:23.640 --> 00:29:24.473
you can't touch people.

00:29:24.473 --> 00:29:28.269
At least here maybe on the rules I can hug or kiss someone,

00:29:28.269 --> 00:29:31.137
beginning of the visit or end of the visit or both.

00:29:31.137 --> 00:29:31.970
Maybe if the rules allow

00:29:31.970 --> 00:29:35.417
I can hold hands with someone during the visit.

00:29:35.417 --> 00:29:37.834
None of that here where people are

00:29:37.834 --> 00:29:39.853
serving minor sentences or

00:29:39.853 --> 00:29:41.150
are legally innocent.

00:29:41.150 --> 00:29:42.615
But nowadays in jails,

00:29:42.615 --> 00:29:46.615
visitation rooms are starting to look like this.

00:29:46.955 --> 00:29:48.951
It's called video visitation.

00:29:48.951 --> 00:29:50.951
And you know you can see

00:29:51.019 --> 00:29:52.569
the technology doesn't work well.

00:29:52.569 --> 00:29:55.319
We see the tops of peoples heads.

00:29:56.389 --> 00:29:58.657
And the companies are pushing this service

00:29:58.657 --> 00:29:59.855
for a bunch of reasons.

00:29:59.855 --> 00:30:04.022
One is cause it's not currently regulated by the FCC.

00:30:05.947 --> 00:30:08.490
Well alright, I got another video to

00:30:08.490 --> 00:30:09.454
see if we can explain

00:30:09.454 --> 00:30:11.954
how they explain this service.

00:30:12.171 --> 00:30:13.647
(bouncy music)
- [Skype] Hi I'm Skype.

00:30:13.647 --> 00:30:15.380
- And I'm video visitation

00:30:15.380 --> 00:30:16.350
and I'm just like Skype.

00:30:16.350 --> 00:30:17.183
- What?

00:30:17.400 --> 00:30:18.542
No matter where your family is

00:30:18.542 --> 00:30:20.725
you can stay in touch with Skype.

00:30:20.725 --> 00:30:22.407
- And if your prison uses our service,

00:30:22.407 --> 00:30:24.581
all in person visits are banned.

00:30:24.581 --> 00:30:25.748
- Sorry, what?

00:30:26.018 --> 00:30:28.620
- Yeah, it's right here in the contract.

00:30:28.620 --> 00:30:30.953
All in person visits banned.

00:30:32.224 --> 00:30:33.057
- Why?

00:30:34.908 --> 00:30:36.150
- Well first of all,

00:30:36.150 --> 00:30:37.614
if we ban in person visits,

00:30:37.614 --> 00:30:39.057
we make a boatload of money.

00:30:39.057 --> 00:30:40.140
And secondly,

00:30:40.194 --> 00:30:41.682
who wants to see their families.

00:30:41.682 --> 00:30:42.932
It's a win win.

00:30:43.412 --> 00:30:46.690
- It's disgusting, everybody wants to see their families.

00:30:46.690 --> 00:30:49.233
- Not everybody wants to see their families.

00:30:49.233 --> 00:30:51.806
Some people had families that were suffocating.

00:30:51.806 --> 00:30:53.380
And maybe didn't allow them

00:30:53.380 --> 00:30:54.934
to pursue their artistic interests

00:30:54.934 --> 00:30:57.101
in ventriloquism or kites.

00:30:59.998 --> 00:31:02.998
- Are you talking about your family?

00:31:03.529 --> 00:31:04.362
- No.

00:31:05.498 --> 00:31:08.472
- You're using your weird family background

00:31:08.472 --> 00:31:09.879
to hurt millions of people.

00:31:09.879 --> 00:31:11.796
You are a sad, sad man.

00:31:11.962 --> 00:31:14.545
(bouncy music)

00:31:19.514 --> 00:31:21.597
- And so if you go and do

00:31:22.767 --> 00:31:23.771
a visitation room that looks like this

00:31:23.771 --> 00:31:25.355
it's a little bit easier for the jail.

00:31:25.355 --> 00:31:29.272
You know, you don't have to move people around.

00:31:29.436 --> 00:31:31.115
And you make this process stinks so much

00:31:31.115 --> 00:31:34.189
that you have to drive across county...

00:31:34.189 --> 00:31:35.022
How long would it take to get to the

00:31:35.022 --> 00:31:37.265
L.A. county jail from here,

00:31:37.265 --> 00:31:38.098
which is downtown somewhere.

00:31:38.098 --> 00:31:39.820
Like a very, yeah I'm seeing like ugly looks on your faces.

00:31:39.820 --> 00:31:40.724
Like a very long time.

00:31:40.724 --> 00:31:43.147
So like oh, I'm gonna go all the way down town

00:31:43.147 --> 00:31:45.134
to look at like this computer screen.

00:31:45.134 --> 00:31:47.000
Alright, I'll just pay a dollar a minute

00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:47.969
to do it from home.

00:31:47.969 --> 00:31:50.744
That's what the whole goal is to drive people to.

00:31:50.744 --> 00:31:54.827
And there's a bill pending now in the legislature

00:31:55.707 --> 00:31:58.021
to prevent jails in California

00:31:58.021 --> 00:31:59.943
from banning in person visits.

00:31:59.943 --> 00:32:01.829
And it's passed the House,

00:32:01.829 --> 00:32:02.881
it's passed the Senate.

00:32:02.881 --> 00:32:05.304
The governor hasn't signed it yet,

00:32:05.304 --> 00:32:07.083
and he has until the end of the month.

00:32:07.083 --> 00:32:09.314
And you know it looks like he may not be signing it.

00:32:09.314 --> 00:32:12.390
So there was a protest outside of his office

00:32:12.390 --> 00:32:14.223
on Monday and a rally.

00:32:14.900 --> 00:32:17.269
And so this something you actually

00:32:17.269 --> 00:32:18.990
can get involved in and help on.

00:32:18.990 --> 00:32:21.334
The governor needs more people to tell him

00:32:21.334 --> 00:32:23.917
that real visits #areimportant.

00:32:24.417 --> 00:32:27.000
And then you should sign SB1157

00:32:27.482 --> 00:32:28.420
and there's a Facebook group

00:32:28.420 --> 00:32:30.321
with updates on this in California.

00:32:30.321 --> 00:32:31.728
Like this is a big thing

00:32:31.728 --> 00:32:33.510
like that you can do right now

00:32:33.510 --> 00:32:36.825
that will make a difference in California.

00:32:36.825 --> 00:32:39.477
Would also make a bigger difference in other states

00:32:39.477 --> 00:32:40.425
cause Texas,

00:32:40.425 --> 00:32:42.964
Texas passed a similar legislation.

00:32:42.964 --> 00:32:45.797
And if anybody feels uncomfortable

00:32:45.992 --> 00:32:49.041
with saying that like Texas is more enlightened

00:32:49.041 --> 00:32:52.327
on criminal justice policy than California,

00:32:52.327 --> 00:32:53.994
if that bothers you,

00:32:54.048 --> 00:32:57.631
you know you need to call the governor now.

00:32:57.864 --> 00:32:59.198
But we get California into this,

00:32:59.198 --> 00:33:02.964
we can pressure a few more states to do the same thing.

00:33:02.964 --> 00:33:03.797
So,

00:33:05.058 --> 00:33:07.369
I've dumped a lot on the bad news.

00:33:07.369 --> 00:33:09.258
And the good news is...

00:33:09.258 --> 00:33:10.680
There's some things to be optimistic about.

00:33:10.680 --> 00:33:11.862
So I started doing this work

00:33:11.862 --> 00:33:14.171
at a time where incarceration was going up, up, and up,

00:33:14.171 --> 00:33:18.088
and the only real, interesting dispute was over

00:33:18.843 --> 00:33:20.857
which party was going to work harder

00:33:20.857 --> 00:33:24.690
to convince the public that they were the most

00:33:25.667 --> 00:33:28.142
law and order, lock em up, throw away the key.

00:33:28.142 --> 00:33:29.809
And that is changed.

00:33:30.496 --> 00:33:32.248
Criminal justice reform is in the air.

00:33:32.248 --> 00:33:34.148
Our elected officials, and all levels of government,

00:33:34.148 --> 00:33:36.772
up to even Congress are talking about criminal justice.

00:33:36.772 --> 00:33:38.436
In most states they're not doing anything,

00:33:38.436 --> 00:33:41.656
but they are talking about it in a way that is new.

00:33:41.656 --> 00:33:43.899
And it suggest a willingness.

00:33:43.899 --> 00:33:45.889
They don't have any ideas or willingness to prioritize it,

00:33:45.889 --> 00:33:47.650
but it suggest a willingness to do something

00:33:47.650 --> 00:33:51.150
on criminal justice form, that's exciting.

00:33:52.607 --> 00:33:53.527
I just wanna remind people of like...

00:33:53.527 --> 00:33:56.277
Imagine a parallel universe where

00:33:56.564 --> 00:33:57.850
Hillary Clinton is...

00:33:57.850 --> 00:34:01.767
It's not clear that she's gonna win the primary

00:34:02.058 --> 00:34:03.186
over Bernie Sanders.

00:34:03.186 --> 00:34:06.172
So on the eve of a really important primary,

00:34:06.172 --> 00:34:08.549
she doesn't campaign, gets on her plane,

00:34:08.549 --> 00:34:11.651
goes back to Arkansas, and oversees an execution

00:34:11.651 --> 00:34:13.416
of a man who is so mentally retarded,

00:34:13.416 --> 00:34:16.613
he saved his desert for after his execution.

00:34:16.613 --> 00:34:19.031
Because Hillary Clinton needs to be seen

00:34:19.031 --> 00:34:20.748
as a supporter of the death penalty

00:34:20.748 --> 00:34:22.133
and supporter of law and order.

00:34:22.133 --> 00:34:24.180
And that was the trick that gets her

00:34:24.180 --> 00:34:27.096
to sinch the nomination over Bernie Sanders.

00:34:27.096 --> 00:34:29.086
Now this is a crazy parallel universe

00:34:29.086 --> 00:34:31.329
and I'm seeing some like frightened looks on this.

00:34:31.329 --> 00:34:34.403
This is actually almost entirely true,

00:34:34.403 --> 00:34:37.059
except it's Bill Clinton in 1992.

00:34:37.059 --> 00:34:39.383
A very deliberate attempt to

00:34:39.383 --> 00:34:41.726
run to the right of the Republicans,

00:34:41.726 --> 00:34:44.164
in order to make the point that Democrats

00:34:44.164 --> 00:34:48.331
can be irrationally, reactionary on criminal justice.

00:34:49.713 --> 00:34:50.546
And...

00:34:52.529 --> 00:34:54.240
That's what's changed.

00:34:54.240 --> 00:34:55.863
Is that Hillary Clinton

00:34:55.863 --> 00:34:59.613
or any serious presidential candidate in 2016

00:35:00.345 --> 00:35:01.845
would not do that.

00:35:02.509 --> 00:35:03.912
You know, they might about the degree

00:35:03.912 --> 00:35:05.621
to which the death penalty makes them nervous

00:35:05.621 --> 00:35:06.946
or that they oppose it

00:35:06.946 --> 00:35:09.269
but nobody would go out of their way

00:35:09.269 --> 00:35:12.602
to fly back so that they could receive a

00:35:13.610 --> 00:35:16.110
`clemency` `petition` and deny it,

00:35:16.634 --> 00:35:17.705
that you've already decided you're gonna deny.

00:35:17.705 --> 00:35:18.538
Like nobody would do that.

00:35:18.538 --> 00:35:20.591
That is a different universe that we live in now

00:35:20.591 --> 00:35:22.674
and that's the good news.

00:35:23.479 --> 00:35:24.840
And I'd like to think that when people write

00:35:24.840 --> 00:35:27.706
the history of the movement against mass incarceration,

00:35:27.706 --> 00:35:29.307
they're gonna look back at right now.

00:35:29.307 --> 00:35:31.447
Because a bunch of big things have changed.

00:35:31.447 --> 00:35:33.832
And I think the phone justice campaign at the FCC

00:35:33.832 --> 00:35:36.155
is actually this big turning point.

00:35:36.155 --> 00:35:37.903
Cause this is something where

00:35:37.903 --> 00:35:40.584
a petition that was filed by this blind grandmother

00:35:40.584 --> 00:35:43.251
whose grandson was incarcerated.

00:35:43.345 --> 00:35:46.048
And she's having a hard time paying her rent,

00:35:46.048 --> 00:35:48.134
and the phone bill at the same time.

00:35:48.134 --> 00:35:49.191
Paying hundreds of dollars a month

00:35:49.191 --> 00:35:50.228
to communicate with her grandson,

00:35:50.228 --> 00:35:51.741
to be this lifeline for him.

00:35:51.741 --> 00:35:53.081
She has this petition at the FCC

00:35:53.081 --> 00:35:54.314
and they ignore it for years.

00:35:54.314 --> 00:35:55.723
And then a couple years ago,

00:35:55.723 --> 00:35:57.695
the FCC starts to pay attention.

00:35:57.695 --> 00:36:01.112
Again, I think it's in large part because

00:36:01.833 --> 00:36:03.055
this eleven million people

00:36:03.055 --> 00:36:04.293
who cycle through jail every year.

00:36:04.293 --> 00:36:06.011
Plus all the people that cycle through prisons.

00:36:06.011 --> 00:36:09.432
Including like FCC staff are willing to like

00:36:09.432 --> 00:36:12.350
have these experiences and they're willing to

00:36:12.350 --> 00:36:13.504
like be honest about them

00:36:13.504 --> 00:36:15.115
and to take a request like this seriously,

00:36:15.115 --> 00:36:16.993
to regulate this small industry

00:36:16.993 --> 00:36:19.858
that raises a billion dollars off of poor families.

00:36:19.858 --> 00:36:22.262
Like, that's a different kinda tipping point

00:36:22.262 --> 00:36:25.845
that we've reached that gives us some room.

00:36:26.356 --> 00:36:28.537
There was a time when all those families could be ignored,

00:36:28.537 --> 00:36:30.069
and now there's so many,

00:36:30.069 --> 00:36:32.356
and there's you know the cell phone videos of the police,

00:36:32.356 --> 00:36:33.808
there's enough kinda avenues

00:36:33.808 --> 00:36:35.376
to have these larger discussions.

00:36:35.376 --> 00:36:38.043
So that's my reason for optimism

00:36:39.361 --> 00:36:42.036
and it's my hope in 10 or 20 years

00:36:42.036 --> 00:36:43.662
we can look back at now

00:36:43.662 --> 00:36:44.941
and it be this very clear kinda sign that like

00:36:44.941 --> 00:36:48.274
this was the beginning of the change but

00:36:50.289 --> 00:36:52.799
we're succeeding at getting this country to understand

00:36:52.799 --> 00:36:54.763
how mass incarceration doesn't work,

00:36:54.763 --> 00:36:57.180
and how it hurts everyone but

00:36:58.030 --> 00:36:59.323
we haven't figured all the things out.

00:36:59.323 --> 00:37:00.849
And it's my hope that this framework can kinda

00:37:00.849 --> 00:37:02.307
help us all do that but this is something

00:37:02.307 --> 00:37:03.319
where I really honestly have to say to y'all.

00:37:03.319 --> 00:37:05.421
This is where we all have to come together,

00:37:05.421 --> 00:37:06.979
kinda figure this out ourselves,

00:37:06.979 --> 00:37:08.643
and come up with these answers.

00:37:08.643 --> 00:37:11.187
Cause speaking for myself personally,

00:37:11.187 --> 00:37:14.495
I don't have faith in our elected officials to

00:37:14.495 --> 00:37:17.616
come up with the answer for criminal justice reform.

00:37:17.616 --> 00:37:19.414
And that's not so much a judgement of them.

00:37:19.414 --> 00:37:21.766
It's because our elected officials' jobs

00:37:21.766 --> 00:37:23.921
is to be generalists, and to listen to people,

00:37:23.921 --> 00:37:25.181
and to make decisions.

00:37:25.181 --> 00:37:28.019
Coming up with answers is not their strong suit.

00:37:28.019 --> 00:37:29.237
That's what we need to do,

00:37:29.237 --> 00:37:30.199
we need to come up with answers.

00:37:30.199 --> 00:37:31.032
You know for example,

00:37:31.032 --> 00:37:33.002
tell governor Brown that real visits

00:37:33.002 --> 00:37:35.247
are a no-brainer and to sign the thing,

00:37:35.247 --> 00:37:36.997
and make him do that.

00:37:38.009 --> 00:37:41.509
And establish a baseline for what we want.

00:37:42.537 --> 00:37:45.721
So that's how we can make criminal justice reform happen.

00:37:45.721 --> 00:37:47.959
Hopefully I gave you a crash course that was helpful.

00:37:47.959 --> 00:37:49.855
I will stop there and answer questions

00:37:49.855 --> 00:37:52.056
and we can have a discussion.

00:37:52.056 --> 00:37:53.495
Thank you very much.

00:37:53.495 --> 00:37:55.745
(applause)

00:38:03.197 --> 00:38:04.030
- [Michael] We now have time for a question

00:38:04.030 --> 00:38:05.251
and answer session.

00:38:05.251 --> 00:38:06.125
If you have a question,

00:38:06.125 --> 00:38:06.958
please raise your hand

00:38:06.958 --> 00:38:09.625
and Sarah or I will come to you.

00:38:14.059 --> 00:38:16.180
- [Male] Hi, oh sorry sure.

00:38:16.180 --> 00:38:19.192
So, during this conversations of mass incarceration

00:38:19.192 --> 00:38:20.618
I feel like that's talked about

00:38:20.618 --> 00:38:22.918
is the war on drugs and drug arrests.

00:38:22.918 --> 00:38:25.348
So I was really surprised to see in your

00:38:25.348 --> 00:38:28.585
pie chart that violent crimes and property crimes

00:38:28.585 --> 00:38:32.002
took up a much bigger portion of arrests.

00:38:32.807 --> 00:38:35.899
So I wanted just to hear your opinion on

00:38:35.899 --> 00:38:37.899
the increase in rates of

00:38:38.308 --> 00:38:40.176
incarceration for those two crimes,

00:38:40.176 --> 00:38:42.815
and what we should do about those

00:38:42.815 --> 00:38:45.565
or about the increase in arrests.

00:38:46.421 --> 00:38:48.834
- A lot of the stuff with violent crime,

00:38:48.834 --> 00:38:49.935
why that's so big is because

00:38:49.935 --> 00:38:53.602
the sentences are longer for violent crimes.

00:38:54.331 --> 00:38:57.745
And we need to have a conversation about like is

00:38:57.745 --> 00:39:01.696
prison the appropriate treatment for all these things.

00:39:01.696 --> 00:39:03.487
And why are the sentence lengths what they are.

00:39:03.487 --> 00:39:04.459
I just don't do quickie stories.

00:39:04.459 --> 00:39:05.459
There's this

00:39:06.240 --> 00:39:08.545
station on cable that has...

00:39:08.545 --> 00:39:12.712
I've seen on U.S. cable this british version of Cops.

00:39:12.749 --> 00:39:13.838
And I love watching this.

00:39:13.838 --> 00:39:15.789
You know they'll show you like a police chase,

00:39:15.789 --> 00:39:17.181
and like they'll see then the person get tackled

00:39:17.181 --> 00:39:18.396
and arrested at the end.

00:39:18.396 --> 00:39:19.474
Like the narrator says,

00:39:19.474 --> 00:39:21.470
"This person you know who led this police chase

00:39:21.470 --> 00:39:23.941
"and endangered 12 people and destroyed four cars

00:39:23.941 --> 00:39:25.318
"is gonna do some serious time."

00:39:25.318 --> 00:39:28.859
They might go away for as long as two years.

00:39:28.859 --> 00:39:30.412
It's like these things are all relative.

00:39:30.412 --> 00:39:32.737
These numbers of sentences come out of thin air,

00:39:32.737 --> 00:39:34.188
and the only thing they do,

00:39:34.188 --> 00:39:35.669
is like when they discover it doesn't stop crime,

00:39:35.669 --> 00:39:36.758
they get increase again.

00:39:36.758 --> 00:39:38.349
That is a solution that doesn't work,

00:39:38.349 --> 00:39:39.696
so we do need to have a conversation,

00:39:39.696 --> 00:39:42.522
what should sentences be, how long should they be,

00:39:42.522 --> 00:39:44.189
can they be shorter?

00:39:45.121 --> 00:39:46.755
And that's true for violent crime

00:39:46.755 --> 00:39:49.120
and that's true for property crime.

00:39:49.120 --> 00:39:51.668
And it also means getting into like

00:39:51.668 --> 00:39:53.667
the details around these definitions.

00:39:53.667 --> 00:39:56.091
So like there's a big number here for murder

00:39:56.091 --> 00:39:58.298
but lots of things are murder.

00:39:58.298 --> 00:40:00.284
Driving a get away car where

00:40:00.284 --> 00:40:02.967
someone robs a bank and a teller is killed

00:40:02.967 --> 00:40:05.053
is considered murder in most states.

00:40:05.053 --> 00:40:07.649
Driving a get away car where your co-bank robber

00:40:07.649 --> 00:40:10.493
is killed by the police is also considered murder.

00:40:10.493 --> 00:40:12.660
Like there's a whole continuum of things

00:40:12.660 --> 00:40:15.516
where some offenses are not as significant as we think.

00:40:15.516 --> 00:40:17.099
Also people change.

00:40:17.198 --> 00:40:20.303
You know, people make mistakes when they're young,

00:40:20.303 --> 00:40:22.470
I think you all know that.

00:40:22.935 --> 00:40:26.632
Some people are different and change in time.

00:40:26.632 --> 00:40:28.255
They don't need to be in prison anymore,

00:40:28.255 --> 00:40:29.764
by any stretch of the imagination.

00:40:29.764 --> 00:40:31.457
The same things due for property.

00:40:31.457 --> 00:40:32.290
The things about drugs,

00:40:32.290 --> 00:40:34.114
so drugs get more credit.

00:40:34.114 --> 00:40:35.354
The war on drugs gets more credit

00:40:35.354 --> 00:40:38.879
for mass incarceration than it deserves but

00:40:38.879 --> 00:40:42.463
drugs are a kinda gateway drug for the system

00:40:42.463 --> 00:40:46.373
to arrest people, give people a criminal record.

00:40:46.373 --> 00:40:48.883
So lots of people get arrested and then get probation.

00:40:48.883 --> 00:40:50.441
And then you're under police surveillance,

00:40:50.441 --> 00:40:52.247
and then your house is being searched periodically,

00:40:52.247 --> 00:40:53.771
and then you get arrested for something else.

00:40:53.771 --> 00:40:55.048
And then you have a record,

00:40:55.048 --> 00:40:56.703
so now you're gonna get a longer sentence for that

00:40:56.703 --> 00:40:58.536
petty assault you did.

00:41:00.734 --> 00:41:02.758
We definitely need to think about more than

00:41:02.758 --> 00:41:06.007
just the drug offenses so you're right there.

00:41:06.007 --> 00:41:09.924
You know, and I think that's an important fact.

00:41:10.332 --> 00:41:11.246
- [Male] Thank you so much for your talk.

00:41:11.246 --> 00:41:12.540
I have so many questions for you

00:41:12.540 --> 00:41:14.290
but just picking one,

00:41:14.738 --> 00:41:15.922
you and I both know that

00:41:15.922 --> 00:41:17.340
despite what Donald Trump might tell us,

00:41:17.340 --> 00:41:20.920
that crime rates are decreasing since the 1990s.

00:41:20.920 --> 00:41:24.170
And you talked about how incarceration,

00:41:24.740 --> 00:41:26.245
and this was toward the beginning of your speech,

00:41:26.245 --> 00:41:28.328
how incarceration and crime rates

00:41:28.328 --> 00:41:29.501
have very little correlation,

00:41:29.501 --> 00:41:31.193
and very little to do with each other.

00:41:31.193 --> 00:41:33.459
I'm curious that in light of that,

00:41:33.459 --> 00:41:34.592
what do you think is responsible

00:41:34.592 --> 00:41:37.259
for the decrease in crime rates?

00:41:37.686 --> 00:41:38.519
- It's a lot of factors.

00:41:38.519 --> 00:41:40.352
It's the economy, it's

00:41:42.243 --> 00:41:43.660
reduction in lead

00:41:45.635 --> 00:41:47.156
in poor communities.

00:41:47.156 --> 00:41:49.510
Like removing lead from gasoline

00:41:49.510 --> 00:41:51.506
and from houses reduces the number

00:41:51.506 --> 00:41:53.673
of people that you poison.

00:41:54.344 --> 00:41:55.177
It's...

00:41:57.671 --> 00:41:58.504
What else could it be?

00:41:58.504 --> 00:41:59.337
It's a lot of...

00:41:59.337 --> 00:42:01.134
Oh guns, reducing the number of guns.

00:42:01.134 --> 00:42:02.281
Like you know, there's still way too many

00:42:02.281 --> 00:42:03.114
guns in this country,

00:42:03.114 --> 00:42:06.447
but one thing that we did in the 90s was

00:42:06.525 --> 00:42:08.847
the federal government basically shut down

00:42:08.847 --> 00:42:11.185
the really cheap gun manufactures.

00:42:11.185 --> 00:42:12.144
So it's no longer possible

00:42:12.144 --> 00:42:14.311
to buy a hang gun for $20.

00:42:14.573 --> 00:42:17.406
And if you buy a hand gun for $20,

00:42:17.452 --> 00:42:18.452
you don't...

00:42:18.766 --> 00:42:19.973
You know they call them Saturday night specials,

00:42:19.973 --> 00:42:21.943
you don't need to save up very long.

00:42:21.943 --> 00:42:22.776
This doesn't take make planning

00:42:22.776 --> 00:42:24.730
and all kinds of mayhem can ensure.

00:42:24.730 --> 00:42:27.085
Now they didn't do what other countries have done

00:42:27.085 --> 00:42:28.269
when they have serious gun control

00:42:28.269 --> 00:42:30.504
and go and collect all the guns.

00:42:30.504 --> 00:42:32.531
But it turns out luckily that

00:42:32.531 --> 00:42:34.581
cheap hand guns aren't very good.

00:42:34.581 --> 00:42:35.792
They don't last very long,

00:42:35.792 --> 00:42:37.365
so all of those cheap hand guns

00:42:37.365 --> 00:42:39.029
that were sold before they were banned

00:42:39.029 --> 00:42:40.612
are all broken now.

00:42:42.005 --> 00:42:42.964
So that helps.

00:42:42.964 --> 00:42:45.412
Also the end of the crack epidemic,

00:42:45.412 --> 00:42:47.559
like both the concept of like

00:42:47.559 --> 00:42:50.227
crack was bad and destabilizing existing drug markets,

00:42:50.227 --> 00:42:52.394
like all that kinda change

00:42:53.792 --> 00:42:54.792
is over now.

00:42:55.600 --> 00:42:57.139
You can also see like yes,

00:42:57.139 --> 00:42:58.653
is crime up in Baltimore?

00:42:58.653 --> 00:43:00.200
Yes, some of that has to do with like

00:43:00.200 --> 00:43:02.075
the drugs that were looted during the riot.

00:43:02.075 --> 00:43:03.912
It's like destabilizing the drug market

00:43:03.912 --> 00:43:06.163
and now it seems like it's back

00:43:06.163 --> 00:43:08.163
to like its lower level.

00:43:08.954 --> 00:43:10.904
What Donald Trump is tying into

00:43:10.904 --> 00:43:13.404
is that people are very bad at

00:43:14.523 --> 00:43:15.851
predicting crime rates.

00:43:15.851 --> 00:43:17.829
If you ask people "Is crime going up?"

00:43:17.829 --> 00:43:19.456
People every year consistently,

00:43:19.456 --> 00:43:22.355
for the last 30 years will say crime is going up.

00:43:22.355 --> 00:43:26.139
If you ask them "Is crime going up in your neighborhood?"

00:43:26.139 --> 00:43:28.025
Most people will say it's going up

00:43:28.025 --> 00:43:30.080
but it will have a some what of a resemblance

00:43:30.080 --> 00:43:31.580
to actual reality.

00:43:31.635 --> 00:43:33.456
But you ask them in general if crime is going up,

00:43:33.456 --> 00:43:35.263
they're gonna say it's going up

00:43:35.263 --> 00:43:37.059
because its what's on the news.

00:43:37.059 --> 00:43:38.044
And why is it on the news?

00:43:38.044 --> 00:43:40.078
Because that's easy, cheap to do.

00:43:40.078 --> 00:43:41.010
It gets ratings,

00:43:41.010 --> 00:43:42.549
and think of this way,

00:43:42.549 --> 00:43:43.730
if you're a news producer

00:43:43.730 --> 00:43:45.779
and you're doing a 6 o'clock broadcast

00:43:45.779 --> 00:43:46.928
and an 11 o'clock broadcast,

00:43:46.928 --> 00:43:48.238
what do you put on the 11 o'clock news

00:43:48.238 --> 00:43:49.883
that was not on at 6?

00:43:49.883 --> 00:43:51.241
Well crime works because police are the only

00:43:51.241 --> 00:43:54.557
government agency that's still open after 6 o'clock.

00:43:54.557 --> 00:43:56.572
Like it's a bunch of things that all factor in together,

00:43:56.572 --> 00:43:58.843
so it doesn't have to be a conspiracy theory

00:43:58.843 --> 00:44:00.343
to confuse people.

00:44:00.558 --> 00:44:03.671
But a bunch of bad things come together to make

00:44:03.671 --> 00:44:06.249
punishment into, in the prison system,

00:44:06.249 --> 00:44:08.387
into this one-stop solution

00:44:08.387 --> 00:44:10.605
for all kinds of social problems that it doesn't work at.

00:44:10.605 --> 00:44:12.525
And that's where we have to find ways

00:44:12.525 --> 00:44:14.085
that's gonna break that,

00:44:14.085 --> 00:44:16.404
I don't know what's the opposite of `fortuitous`?

00:44:16.404 --> 00:44:18.821
That like `unfortuitous` cycle.

00:44:19.210 --> 00:44:22.293
Long answer to your awesome question.

00:44:25.679 --> 00:44:26.758
- [Female] Hi, so you just kinda

00:44:26.758 --> 00:44:29.900
touched on this briefly but you talked about

00:44:29.900 --> 00:44:31.648
drugs being kinda like a gateway

00:44:31.648 --> 00:44:33.420
for people being imprisoned

00:44:33.420 --> 00:44:34.918
but I also know that mental health

00:44:34.918 --> 00:44:37.891
has also contributed to the rise of incarceration.

00:44:37.891 --> 00:44:40.850
And with the end of institutions in the 60s,

00:44:40.850 --> 00:44:42.487
a lot of people with mental health problems

00:44:42.487 --> 00:44:43.859
have been incarcerated,

00:44:43.859 --> 00:44:44.719
so I was wondering if you had

00:44:44.719 --> 00:44:47.136
any thoughts on that as well?

00:44:48.282 --> 00:44:50.615
- Yeah, so if you look at...

00:44:52.598 --> 00:44:55.681
So this graph of incarceration rates,

00:44:57.117 --> 00:44:57.950
if you were to overlay on it

00:44:57.950 --> 00:45:01.002
also like the mental hospital institutionalized rate,

00:45:01.002 --> 00:45:03.152
it kinda looks like the reverse.

00:45:03.152 --> 00:45:04.801
It use to be much higher into the time we

00:45:04.801 --> 00:45:06.420
deinstitutionalized people and dumped them out

00:45:06.420 --> 00:45:08.689
onto the street without community support.

00:45:08.689 --> 00:45:09.647
Some of those people then were

00:45:09.647 --> 00:45:13.814
directly transferred to the criminal justice system.

00:45:13.899 --> 00:45:15.711
And there's a real kinda need

00:45:15.711 --> 00:45:17.910
to give people appropriate resources.

00:45:17.910 --> 00:45:20.312
And if someone has a mental health problem,

00:45:20.312 --> 00:45:22.389
like there is no way in which

00:45:22.389 --> 00:45:24.951
putting them in a very stressful situation

00:45:24.951 --> 00:45:26.540
in a cage with other people

00:45:26.540 --> 00:45:27.694
who are also highly stressed

00:45:27.694 --> 00:45:29.661
is going to help them succeed.

00:45:29.661 --> 00:45:31.981
Like that's at this most kinda basic level

00:45:31.981 --> 00:45:34.981
and there's a little bit of dabbling

00:45:35.028 --> 00:45:37.842
in some communities about creating alternative

00:45:37.842 --> 00:45:40.047
mental health courts for people with diagnosed

00:45:40.047 --> 00:45:41.518
mental health problems,

00:45:41.518 --> 00:45:43.036
if the offense is not violent,

00:45:43.036 --> 00:45:44.503
and 12,000 other exceptions.

00:45:44.503 --> 00:45:46.023
And like those are good and all

00:45:46.023 --> 00:45:47.523
but it's a kind of

00:45:48.217 --> 00:45:49.050
again...

00:45:51.289 --> 00:45:53.736
You know alright, what's the analogy.

00:45:53.736 --> 00:45:55.819
If the only tool you have is a hammer,

00:45:55.819 --> 00:45:58.230
every problem is going to look like a nail.

00:45:58.230 --> 00:46:00.249
And that's how our criminal justice system works

00:46:00.249 --> 00:46:02.660
and what that means it's doing is

00:46:02.660 --> 00:46:04.742
it's denting a lot of things

00:46:04.742 --> 00:46:07.075
that really need other help.

00:46:09.369 --> 00:46:10.202
You know some of this, I'll say something

00:46:10.202 --> 00:46:11.035
sympathetic for the police,

00:46:11.035 --> 00:46:13.730
like we put too much burden on the police.

00:46:13.730 --> 00:46:15.313
Why are police like

00:46:15.506 --> 00:46:16.769
doing the criminal law.

00:46:16.769 --> 00:46:17.886
They're enforcing the civil law,

00:46:17.886 --> 00:46:19.529
when a traffic light's out they have to do that.

00:46:19.529 --> 00:46:21.767
They're also like mental health counselors

00:46:21.767 --> 00:46:23.601
and they get you know two hours of training

00:46:23.601 --> 00:46:25.687
on each one of these things.

00:46:25.687 --> 00:46:28.283
Like this is setting them up to fail.

00:46:28.283 --> 00:46:31.822
And like if you want to succeed and do something well,

00:46:31.822 --> 00:46:33.923
you have to have people who can do that thing well,

00:46:33.923 --> 00:46:35.783
and you have to train them to do it.

00:46:35.783 --> 00:46:39.616
And that's not been a lot of interest in that.

00:46:40.497 --> 00:46:42.819
You know the thing that really kind of, you know...

00:46:42.819 --> 00:46:44.721
Some off you are kinda highly critical of the police,

00:46:44.721 --> 00:46:45.554
I'll just say something,

00:46:45.554 --> 00:46:49.114
like how many people of the Texas pool party

00:46:49.114 --> 00:46:51.009
that white cop is throwing the black girl

00:46:51.009 --> 00:46:53.277
in her bikini to the ground.

00:46:53.277 --> 00:46:55.450
Right, and the other kids are getting upset

00:46:55.450 --> 00:46:58.072
and they rush the cop and he pulls out his gun.

00:46:58.072 --> 00:46:58.905
How many people know what else

00:46:58.905 --> 00:47:00.738
that cop did that day.

00:47:01.524 --> 00:47:03.002
He was a two suicide calls.

00:47:03.002 --> 00:47:05.413
One of them attempted and one of them successful.

00:47:05.413 --> 00:47:08.548
He was like really traumatized by that moment.

00:47:08.548 --> 00:47:12.095
And whoever was responsible for doing the routing,

00:47:12.095 --> 00:47:13.446
and for letting him go to that call,

00:47:13.446 --> 00:47:14.936
and not giving him the afternoon off,

00:47:14.936 --> 00:47:17.711
and sending him to a counselor screwed up.

00:47:17.711 --> 00:47:20.838
Now I say "screwed up" because it's not a mistake.

00:47:20.838 --> 00:47:22.966
Because many police departments have no

00:47:22.966 --> 00:47:25.193
kinda automated way to figure out how

00:47:25.193 --> 00:47:27.526
stressed their officers are.

00:47:28.250 --> 00:47:29.083
And that

00:47:30.146 --> 00:47:32.063
is a structural mistake

00:47:32.792 --> 00:47:36.709
that in the interest of expediency people skip.

00:47:36.829 --> 00:47:38.135
And I'm just telling you,

00:47:38.135 --> 00:47:40.405
if you don't know who your most stressed officers are

00:47:40.405 --> 00:47:42.772
on like a weekly or daily or minute by minute basis,

00:47:42.772 --> 00:47:45.255
you're going to have more problems.

00:47:45.255 --> 00:47:46.922
You have prediction.

00:47:47.240 --> 00:47:50.657
Now do people wanna use that information,

00:47:50.948 --> 00:47:53.656
and are police chiefs willing to go to the

00:47:53.656 --> 00:47:56.398
city council and say, "Here's this obvious thing

00:47:56.398 --> 00:47:58.510
"I should do but it's going to cost x,

00:47:58.510 --> 00:48:00.854
"are you willing to think ahead a few minutes

00:48:00.854 --> 00:48:02.437
"and pay for that."

00:48:03.393 --> 00:48:06.060
And that's the courage question.

00:48:06.092 --> 00:48:07.087
You know or to say hey,

00:48:07.087 --> 00:48:09.991
we're gonna stop issuing parking tickets.

00:48:09.991 --> 00:48:11.551
We're gonna use other people

00:48:11.551 --> 00:48:13.689
that can specialize in that,

00:48:13.689 --> 00:48:15.061
so that we can actually

00:48:15.061 --> 00:48:17.691
send people to mental health training.

00:48:17.691 --> 00:48:19.159
Those are some of like the big picture

00:48:19.159 --> 00:48:20.576
things that we have to do

00:48:20.576 --> 00:48:22.779
to kinda change our criminal justice system.

00:48:22.779 --> 00:48:25.362
Does that answer your question?

00:48:34.683 --> 00:48:36.886
- [Male] Thank you for coming this evening.

00:48:36.886 --> 00:48:40.540
Would you mind going back to the state by state graph?

00:48:40.540 --> 00:48:42.466
I mean if we think of California

00:48:42.466 --> 00:48:44.549
kinda as an example at...

00:48:45.223 --> 00:48:46.399
Sorry the other one with the...

00:48:46.399 --> 00:48:47.735
- The spaghetti one.

00:48:47.735 --> 00:48:48.876
- [Male] Perfect, yeah.

00:48:48.876 --> 00:48:50.266
That if we think of California

00:48:50.266 --> 00:48:53.016
as kinda a example of the nation.

00:48:53.051 --> 00:48:55.715
You know, voters pursued policies that locked people up,

00:48:55.715 --> 00:48:57.165
and locked them up for longer

00:48:57.165 --> 00:48:59.769
all throughout the 90s, early 2000s

00:48:59.769 --> 00:49:02.235
and have sorta been reneging on those policies

00:49:02.235 --> 00:49:04.033
for the past few years.

00:49:04.033 --> 00:49:05.390
But most of that drop off

00:49:05.390 --> 00:49:07.682
has really been because of a federal court order

00:49:07.682 --> 00:49:10.682
that then led to prison realignment.

00:49:10.746 --> 00:49:12.161
And so I guess the question is

00:49:12.161 --> 00:49:14.564
you seem to have a lot of faith in the voters

00:49:14.564 --> 00:49:16.948
to pressure their elected officials,

00:49:16.948 --> 00:49:18.306
but to what extent do you think

00:49:18.306 --> 00:49:20.393
that the courts are actually gonna be

00:49:20.393 --> 00:49:22.726
kinda the initial push here.

00:49:24.077 --> 00:49:25.900
- Alright so that's two problems.

00:49:25.900 --> 00:49:26.829
One's about my thought about the courts

00:49:26.829 --> 00:49:29.901
and one's actually my thought about me.

00:49:29.901 --> 00:49:32.401
And my thought about courts is

00:49:33.403 --> 00:49:35.598
I don't know if we can repeat

00:49:35.598 --> 00:49:38.791
the victory in California about overcrowding,

00:49:38.791 --> 00:49:40.130
where they were providing...

00:49:40.130 --> 00:49:41.189
The state was treating

00:49:41.189 --> 00:49:43.155
incarcerated people in inhumane ways,

00:49:43.155 --> 00:49:45.651
particularly on health care and mental health care issues.

00:49:45.651 --> 00:49:47.200
And I think that part of the mistake

00:49:47.200 --> 00:49:49.381
that the state made is that the state said,

00:49:49.381 --> 00:49:52.366
"Your Honor we can't afford to do it,

00:49:52.366 --> 00:49:53.620
"we have too many people."

00:49:53.620 --> 00:49:54.513
And they did this for too long

00:49:54.513 --> 00:49:57.088
and the court just said, "Screw you,

00:49:57.088 --> 00:49:58.971
"don't lock up so many people

00:49:58.971 --> 00:50:01.638
"and that will save your money."

00:50:02.081 --> 00:50:04.248
And then ordered the state

00:50:04.887 --> 00:50:05.889
to reduce it's population

00:50:05.889 --> 00:50:07.813
since the state couldn't come up with the money.

00:50:07.813 --> 00:50:10.956
And what the state then did was the shell game

00:50:10.956 --> 00:50:12.330
which changed a bunch of laws,

00:50:12.330 --> 00:50:13.593
and now the voters have changed some additional laws

00:50:13.593 --> 00:50:14.713
and that's a bigger deal.

00:50:14.713 --> 00:50:16.393
But shifted some people...

00:50:16.393 --> 00:50:18.081
Reduced some sentences but also shifted

00:50:18.081 --> 00:50:19.890
some people to local jails.

00:50:19.890 --> 00:50:23.416
So big drop in the state prison rate in California,

00:50:23.416 --> 00:50:26.651
some of that though is just transferred to jails.

00:50:26.651 --> 00:50:28.010
However, the good news is that

00:50:28.010 --> 00:50:30.137
California's still net down.

00:50:30.137 --> 00:50:31.929
So realignment has worked in that way.

00:50:31.929 --> 00:50:33.694
It did reduce the total net population.

00:50:33.694 --> 00:50:36.777
So I don't know if the federal courts

00:50:37.061 --> 00:50:39.604
are dying to get involved in a big way

00:50:39.604 --> 00:50:41.403
like they did in California with other states,

00:50:41.403 --> 00:50:43.758
and I don't know if other states

00:50:43.758 --> 00:50:46.489
would do the same rhetorical blunder

00:50:46.489 --> 00:50:48.156
that California did.

00:50:50.222 --> 00:50:51.814
But the other question though is about me

00:50:51.814 --> 00:50:54.531
and like why am I putting the faith in the voters.

00:50:54.531 --> 00:50:56.531
It's because I have a...

00:50:57.985 --> 00:51:00.104
My plan to influence elected officials

00:51:00.104 --> 00:51:02.953
involves influencing the public to influence them

00:51:02.953 --> 00:51:05.384
because the legislators don't care what I think

00:51:05.384 --> 00:51:06.678
or any one of you.

00:51:06.678 --> 00:51:08.158
They don't care what you think either

00:51:08.158 --> 00:51:11.365
but they do care what big groups of us think,

00:51:11.365 --> 00:51:14.100
and so if I need to use the public

00:51:14.100 --> 00:51:15.498
to get to the elected officials,

00:51:15.498 --> 00:51:16.706
I might as well come up with a plan

00:51:16.706 --> 00:51:18.367
that involves mobilizing the public

00:51:18.367 --> 00:51:21.525
because that's the only thing I know how to do.

00:51:21.525 --> 00:51:22.720
But it's going to take a long time

00:51:22.720 --> 00:51:23.629
because the public wanted this,

00:51:23.629 --> 00:51:24.604
and the public does not have a

00:51:24.604 --> 00:51:25.994
deep understanding of these issues

00:51:25.994 --> 00:51:27.300
and of the trade offs.

00:51:27.300 --> 00:51:28.883
And they need to...

00:51:29.098 --> 00:51:31.118
The public is very good at being manipulated

00:51:31.118 --> 00:51:33.358
by the press when there's a horrible incident happened.

00:51:33.358 --> 00:51:36.347
And you know, horrible incidents will happen.

00:51:36.347 --> 00:51:37.282
Horrible incidents will happen

00:51:37.282 --> 00:51:39.619
by people who are released from prison.

00:51:39.619 --> 00:51:41.558
Horrible incidents will happen you know

00:51:41.558 --> 00:51:43.749
by people who get invited to give talks here.

00:51:43.749 --> 00:51:45.249
Things will happen

00:51:46.014 --> 00:51:48.867
and we need to get people to explain this,

00:51:48.867 --> 00:51:51.059
you know and have realistic expectations.

00:51:51.059 --> 00:51:53.716
If I you know get pneumonia and go to the hospital

00:51:53.716 --> 00:51:55.323
and they treat me and then they release me

00:51:55.323 --> 00:51:56.852
and then I get a cold the next week,

00:51:56.852 --> 00:51:57.936
and I go back to the hospital.

00:51:57.936 --> 00:51:59.864
The hospital didn't fail.

00:51:59.864 --> 00:52:01.364
That was progress.

00:52:01.980 --> 00:52:04.234
And my doctor is like pretty clear about that,

00:52:04.234 --> 00:52:06.188
and my doctor knows how to explain this to the public,

00:52:06.188 --> 00:52:07.762
that it's not malpractice that

00:52:07.762 --> 00:52:09.887
I got a cold after I had pneumonia.

00:52:09.887 --> 00:52:11.979
The criminal justice system is

00:52:11.979 --> 00:52:14.812
not that brave and not that clear.

00:52:14.964 --> 00:52:16.077
And they're not doing a good job

00:52:16.077 --> 00:52:16.910
explaining to the public

00:52:16.910 --> 00:52:18.681
what it is they even do,

00:52:18.681 --> 00:52:21.598
and so we have to both change them,

00:52:21.649 --> 00:52:22.494
and we have to unfortunately

00:52:22.494 --> 00:52:23.765
do some of their job for them

00:52:23.765 --> 00:52:26.525
of explaining what they're suppose to be doing.

00:52:26.525 --> 00:52:30.358
So that's again why I'm fixated on the public.

00:52:30.373 --> 00:52:32.161
So we're clear, there was a hand in the front.

00:52:32.161 --> 00:52:34.244
I don't wanna tell you...

00:52:40.303 --> 00:52:43.163
- [Female] Hi, you highly emphasize

00:52:43.163 --> 00:52:45.235
the amount of people that are

00:52:45.235 --> 00:52:49.381
being held without being convicted in local jails.

00:52:49.381 --> 00:52:51.604
Do you see any positive trends

00:52:51.604 --> 00:52:53.521
that will happen in our

00:52:54.035 --> 00:52:58.202
reliance on bail or is that going to stay the same?

00:52:59.705 --> 00:53:02.205
- Okay so predictions on bail.

00:53:02.338 --> 00:53:05.781
(sighs) So I do my work in a state

00:53:05.781 --> 00:53:07.996
where private bail bondsmen are...

00:53:07.996 --> 00:53:09.208
Where there's this presumption

00:53:09.208 --> 00:53:10.729
that most people are gonna be released

00:53:10.729 --> 00:53:13.930
basically on a promise and that some people

00:53:13.930 --> 00:53:14.901
might have to give money

00:53:14.901 --> 00:53:16.777
but the private industry's not involved,

00:53:16.777 --> 00:53:18.844
you give it to the court.

00:53:18.844 --> 00:53:22.123
In most states there's this whole lobby,

00:53:22.123 --> 00:53:25.213
how many people know Dog the bounty hunter?

00:53:25.213 --> 00:53:26.546
Yeah, like okay.

00:53:27.496 --> 00:53:30.663
Yeah bounty hunters and bail bondsmen.

00:53:30.923 --> 00:53:32.205
Private companies...

00:53:32.205 --> 00:53:35.027
When the judge says you need $10,000,

00:53:35.027 --> 00:53:36.562
private people will say,

00:53:36.562 --> 00:53:38.669
"You give me a thousand cash right now,

00:53:38.669 --> 00:53:41.073
"I'll give the court $10,000 for you,

00:53:41.073 --> 00:53:43.360
"and if you don't show up I'll chase you down."

00:53:43.360 --> 00:53:44.193
Of course the way it actually works

00:53:44.193 --> 00:53:45.717
is they actually don't give

00:53:45.717 --> 00:53:46.885
the money to the court they just...

00:53:46.885 --> 00:53:47.718
If you don't show up

00:53:47.718 --> 00:53:48.551
then they have to give it to the court,

00:53:48.551 --> 00:53:49.763
so it's an awesome business to be in.

00:53:49.763 --> 00:53:50.596
But,

00:53:52.743 --> 00:53:53.736
these people when you have a

00:53:53.736 --> 00:53:57.319
completely reasonable bail reform proposal,

00:53:57.905 --> 00:53:59.676
this industry comes out in force

00:53:59.676 --> 00:54:01.054
and makes big contributions,

00:54:01.054 --> 00:54:03.889
and pushes legislators and makes them fearful,

00:54:03.889 --> 00:54:05.960
and they fight really hard against

00:54:05.960 --> 00:54:08.126
the most modest of bail reforms,

00:54:08.126 --> 00:54:09.376
so that's hard.

00:54:12.994 --> 00:54:14.555
On the other level there's some reasons for optimism.

00:54:14.555 --> 00:54:16.510
A lot of the big cities in this country

00:54:16.510 --> 00:54:18.464
are dropping their jail populations.

00:54:18.464 --> 00:54:20.912
And no one really understands yet

00:54:20.912 --> 00:54:23.497
how much of that is because crime is down in big cities,

00:54:23.497 --> 00:54:24.922
and how much of it is because

00:54:24.922 --> 00:54:27.365
cities are starting to use smarter policies

00:54:27.365 --> 00:54:28.615
on bail, and on

00:54:28.950 --> 00:54:30.904
arresting people for mental health problems,

00:54:30.904 --> 00:54:33.714
and so forth like they're starting to be better.

00:54:33.714 --> 00:54:37.049
Or is it because it's up in rural and suburban areas

00:54:37.049 --> 00:54:40.006
because they're arresting more people

00:54:40.006 --> 00:54:40.839
and they're less sophisticated

00:54:40.839 --> 00:54:41.672
or is it because crime is up.

00:54:41.672 --> 00:54:44.084
Like people really don't know yet.

00:54:44.084 --> 00:54:45.075
But the big worry is the

00:54:45.075 --> 00:54:46.890
lobbying of the bail bond industry

00:54:46.890 --> 00:54:49.595
is enough to make legislators fearful.

00:54:49.595 --> 00:54:51.675
So can they be defeated, yes.

00:54:51.675 --> 00:54:52.825
Have they in some states, yes.

00:54:52.825 --> 00:54:54.795
But like that's a problem

00:54:54.795 --> 00:54:56.134
and they don't get

00:54:56.134 --> 00:54:58.478
the bail bond industry is far more dangerous

00:54:58.478 --> 00:55:00.155
in my view than the private prison industry,

00:55:00.155 --> 00:55:03.322
and they get like zero press attention

00:55:03.408 --> 00:55:05.825
because they're not these big

00:55:06.764 --> 00:55:08.970
publicly traded companies who you can read about

00:55:08.970 --> 00:55:10.075
in the security exchange website.

00:55:10.075 --> 00:55:12.430
Like they're these little small mom and pop people,

00:55:12.430 --> 00:55:13.946
like Dog the bounty hunter

00:55:13.946 --> 00:55:15.351
that like are hard to get data on,

00:55:15.351 --> 00:55:17.053
and hard to write about.

00:55:17.053 --> 00:55:18.604
So it's harder for the 50 states,

00:55:18.604 --> 00:55:20.586
it's hard for journalists to engage them,

00:55:20.586 --> 00:55:21.535
it's harder for me to figure out

00:55:21.535 --> 00:55:24.641
how many bail bonds are written in a year.

00:55:24.641 --> 00:55:27.911
But they're actually much more dangerous.

00:55:27.911 --> 00:55:32.078
It's winnable but you know I'm not ready to give you odds.

00:55:33.696 --> 00:55:35.404
- [Male in Blue] Thank you so much for your talk.

00:55:35.404 --> 00:55:37.308
My question has to do with the

00:55:37.308 --> 00:55:39.558
in large part, the increase

00:55:39.663 --> 00:55:41.663
at the local jail level.

00:55:41.715 --> 00:55:43.659
We know that since the 60s

00:55:43.659 --> 00:55:45.335
with the Gideon Wainwright decision,

00:55:45.335 --> 00:55:46.970
that people are afforded a public defender

00:55:46.970 --> 00:55:48.099
but it's gotten to the point where

00:55:48.099 --> 00:55:49.292
you know in places like Louisiana

00:55:49.292 --> 00:55:52.167
there's one public defender in a whole county.

00:55:52.167 --> 00:55:54.064
So how much of a decrease could we see

00:55:54.064 --> 00:55:55.770
in that local jail population if we

00:55:55.770 --> 00:55:58.213
adequately staffed these public defender offices,

00:55:58.213 --> 00:56:00.197
and didn't give public defenders

00:56:00.197 --> 00:56:01.438
hundreds of cases to deal with

00:56:01.438 --> 00:56:02.625
where the easiest thing to do

00:56:02.625 --> 00:56:04.485
is to convince their client to plead guilty

00:56:04.485 --> 00:56:06.447
because it's easier for them in the long run.

00:56:06.447 --> 00:56:08.280
- Short answer, a lot.

00:56:08.771 --> 00:56:09.751
And it's actually you know...

00:56:09.751 --> 00:56:10.831
(exclaims) If we're looking for things

00:56:10.831 --> 00:56:11.784
the federal government could do,

00:56:11.784 --> 00:56:13.289
the federal government could start paying for

00:56:13.289 --> 00:56:16.180
local defense and subsidizing public defense.

00:56:16.180 --> 00:56:17.514
That actually would

00:56:17.514 --> 00:56:19.217
well send a signal and make a big difference.

00:56:19.217 --> 00:56:20.934
Or also little subtle tweaks that

00:56:20.934 --> 00:56:22.208
overlap with your question.

00:56:22.208 --> 00:56:24.500
Currently under the federal Constitution,

00:56:24.500 --> 00:56:26.026
the way it's interpreted,

00:56:26.026 --> 00:56:26.990
you're not required to have

00:56:26.990 --> 00:56:30.146
a counsel appointed at the bail stage.

00:56:30.146 --> 00:56:32.521
If states were to adopt a reform

00:56:32.521 --> 00:56:34.143
that counsel is appointed

00:56:34.143 --> 00:56:36.643
at the point that bail is set,

00:56:36.649 --> 00:56:39.289
people would be able to make a better case for bail,

00:56:39.289 --> 00:56:40.641
and more people would get bail.

00:56:40.641 --> 00:56:41.480
And we know this from the states

00:56:41.480 --> 00:56:42.777
that have passed these reforms

00:56:42.777 --> 00:56:43.999
or where there's been studies about doing this.

00:56:43.999 --> 00:56:45.546
Like that produces an outcome,

00:56:45.546 --> 00:56:48.005
a better outcome for everyone if you just

00:56:48.005 --> 00:56:49.178
tell the public defenders your allowed

00:56:49.178 --> 00:56:51.678
to start a little bit earlier.

00:56:52.102 --> 00:56:56.269
So yeah there's lots of rooms for reform right there.

00:57:01.081 --> 00:57:03.353
- [Male] You talked a little bit about how

00:57:03.353 --> 00:57:07.245
the prison system is set up for people to fail again.

00:57:07.245 --> 00:57:08.078
I just want know

00:57:08.078 --> 00:57:09.774
if there's statistics on

00:57:09.774 --> 00:57:10.774
how badly...

00:57:11.623 --> 00:57:14.123
How bad the recidivism rate is

00:57:14.306 --> 00:57:16.157
and what the system can do

00:57:16.157 --> 00:57:17.856
to help people not fall back

00:57:17.856 --> 00:57:20.856
into the cycle of the prison system.

00:57:21.229 --> 00:57:23.743
- (Sighs) So recidivism is complicated,

00:57:23.743 --> 00:57:25.694
this is not my specialty

00:57:25.694 --> 00:57:26.617
cause there's some big differences

00:57:26.617 --> 00:57:28.617
in how we measure it so.

00:57:29.976 --> 00:57:31.393
In some states...

00:57:32.223 --> 00:57:33.400
You know there's often the statistic like

00:57:33.400 --> 00:57:36.687
two-thirds, three quarters, that's the common number

00:57:36.687 --> 00:57:38.187
people recidivate.

00:57:38.531 --> 00:57:39.364
And what does that mean?

00:57:39.364 --> 00:57:40.829
That's like someone who like gets out of prison

00:57:40.829 --> 00:57:42.497
and then in the next three or five years

00:57:42.497 --> 00:57:43.888
is arrested again.

00:57:43.888 --> 00:57:45.244
Well arrest doesn't mean anything,

00:57:45.244 --> 00:57:47.293
how bout like had your parole revoked

00:57:47.293 --> 00:57:48.643
or you committed another offense.

00:57:48.643 --> 00:57:49.968
That to me is a more meaningful measure

00:57:49.968 --> 00:57:51.198
and that's lower.

00:57:51.198 --> 00:57:53.390
But then there's also is it a related offense.

00:57:53.390 --> 00:57:54.887
I'm gonna be really blunt like

00:57:54.887 --> 00:57:56.526
if someone is like a serial bank robber

00:57:56.526 --> 00:57:58.251
and goes to prison and gets out,

00:57:58.251 --> 00:57:59.668
and then or no...

00:57:59.947 --> 00:58:01.994
If someone is a murder, gets out,

00:58:01.994 --> 00:58:03.510
and then robs a bank.

00:58:03.510 --> 00:58:05.064
I'm not sure is that recidivism?

00:58:05.064 --> 00:58:07.315
Like that is a significantly less serious offense.

00:58:07.315 --> 00:58:08.702
Let's just be really clear about this.

00:58:08.702 --> 00:58:09.805
But just to blur these together

00:58:09.805 --> 00:58:11.388
or just say arrest,

00:58:11.627 --> 00:58:13.960
you know that's kinda bogus.

00:58:15.502 --> 00:58:16.930
So what can we do?

00:58:16.930 --> 00:58:18.971
Well, we could stop discriminating

00:58:18.971 --> 00:58:21.192
against people with criminal records.

00:58:21.192 --> 00:58:23.816
If you have a criminal record in a lot of states,

00:58:23.816 --> 00:58:25.567
there's all kinds of jobs you can't get.

00:58:25.567 --> 00:58:28.000
For a long time in New York state,

00:58:28.000 --> 00:58:29.453
you couldn't get a barber's license

00:58:29.453 --> 00:58:31.182
if you had a felony conviction.

00:58:31.182 --> 00:58:32.561
And this is doubly funny because

00:58:32.561 --> 00:58:34.622
that's basically the only thing that you can get

00:58:34.622 --> 00:58:36.839
trained to do in a New York state prison

00:58:36.839 --> 00:58:38.973
is how to be a barber but yet you couldn't

00:58:38.973 --> 00:58:42.443
get a barber's license cause you had a felony record.

00:58:42.443 --> 00:58:44.449
You know in most states it's legal

00:58:44.449 --> 00:58:46.532
to put on an application,

00:58:46.665 --> 00:58:48.348
"Have you been convicted of a felony."

00:58:48.348 --> 00:58:49.901
And then just throw away all those applications

00:58:49.901 --> 00:58:51.435
before you even meet people.

00:58:51.435 --> 00:58:53.573
Like there's all these changes there.

00:58:53.573 --> 00:58:55.689
Or oh, thank you Bill Clinton

00:58:55.689 --> 00:58:57.856
there's a provision in the

00:58:57.964 --> 00:58:59.959
federal welfare reform law

00:58:59.959 --> 00:59:02.580
that only a few states have opted out of this part,

00:59:02.580 --> 00:59:05.497
that people who have felony records

00:59:06.381 --> 00:59:07.408
and felony drug convictions

00:59:07.408 --> 00:59:09.710
can not stay in public housing.

00:59:09.710 --> 00:59:12.438
So if my mom is in public housing

00:59:12.438 --> 00:59:13.271
and I have a felony record,

00:59:13.271 --> 00:59:14.406
I can't stay with her when I get out

00:59:14.406 --> 00:59:15.239
so now I'm homeless.

00:59:15.239 --> 00:59:17.989
Like stop doing all these things.

00:59:18.360 --> 00:59:20.222
You know prison does so much harm.

00:59:20.222 --> 00:59:22.087
And you know I just have to like

00:59:22.087 --> 00:59:24.076
think about Chumbawamba here like you know,

00:59:24.076 --> 00:59:26.357
you break my leg, you give me crutches,

00:59:26.357 --> 00:59:28.739
and then you want me to say thank you.

00:59:28.739 --> 00:59:29.963
You know we have to kinda like

00:59:29.963 --> 00:59:32.046
be aware of how much harm

00:59:33.080 --> 00:59:35.553
incarceration is and how much harm it is

00:59:35.553 --> 00:59:37.928
to charge your family a dollar a minute

00:59:37.928 --> 00:59:38.885
to stay in touch with you.

00:59:38.885 --> 00:59:40.767
Like oh my god, your family wants

00:59:40.767 --> 00:59:43.541
to stay in touch with you and we're gonna punish them.

00:59:43.541 --> 00:59:44.873
Like oh no, no, no, no, no, no

00:59:44.873 --> 00:59:47.724
this is wrong like stop doing all these things.

00:59:47.724 --> 00:59:49.387
Like that's what we have to do,

00:59:49.387 --> 00:59:50.220
and we have to figure out

00:59:50.220 --> 00:59:52.271
how to get the system to wanna engage

00:59:52.271 --> 00:59:53.139
those big picture answers

00:59:53.139 --> 00:59:54.603
like I'm sitting here and addressing this to you.

00:59:54.603 --> 00:59:57.270
But we have to figure out to get

00:59:57.746 --> 01:00:01.246
Sheriffs to see that long term investment.

01:00:01.378 --> 01:00:02.640
And some times you see this

01:00:02.640 --> 01:00:04.541
like what did New York state say about

01:00:04.541 --> 01:00:06.637
why they lowered the cost of phones.

01:00:06.637 --> 01:00:08.304
They said like we see it as a

01:00:08.304 --> 01:00:10.946
cheap investment in lowering recidivism.

01:00:10.946 --> 01:00:12.005
Cause they were smart enough

01:00:12.005 --> 01:00:13.095
to do the math in their head

01:00:13.095 --> 01:00:16.725
that foregoing income is just like spending.

01:00:16.725 --> 01:00:18.152
This is also a state that recognizes

01:00:18.152 --> 01:00:19.470
their prisons are in the middle of nowhere,

01:00:19.470 --> 01:00:21.722
so for a long time they would subsidize buses

01:00:21.722 --> 01:00:23.653
so people from New York City could go upstate,

01:00:23.653 --> 01:00:26.236
cause it was a cheap investment

01:00:26.774 --> 01:00:28.682
in lowering recidivism.

01:00:28.682 --> 01:00:30.255
But you have to kinda do that.

01:00:30.255 --> 01:00:32.061
You know and you have to like have jobs for people,

01:00:32.061 --> 01:00:36.061
and you have to like be willing to train people.

01:00:36.082 --> 01:00:37.665
You know don't like

01:00:38.364 --> 01:00:40.261
take away all choice in people's life,

01:00:40.261 --> 01:00:41.927
I mean come on, what is one of the things

01:00:41.927 --> 01:00:44.071
you like learn here in college is like

01:00:44.071 --> 01:00:46.109
to be responsible to do things

01:00:46.109 --> 01:00:48.109
and like when your boyfriend

01:00:48.109 --> 01:00:49.288
or girlfriend breaks up with you,

01:00:49.288 --> 01:00:52.371
you still have to do that term paper.

01:00:53.158 --> 01:00:54.991
But you like take away

01:00:56.932 --> 01:00:58.394
all autonomy from people,

01:00:58.394 --> 01:00:59.657
give them no practical skills,

01:00:59.657 --> 01:01:01.238
give them no life skills,

01:01:01.238 --> 01:01:02.164
and tell them what to do

01:01:02.164 --> 01:01:03.257
for every minute of their lives,

01:01:03.257 --> 01:01:04.090
and then you're surprised that

01:01:04.090 --> 01:01:07.633
they have a hard time adjusting on the outside.

01:01:07.633 --> 01:01:09.753
Of course, this is why like...

01:01:09.753 --> 01:01:11.257
How do European prisons work?

01:01:11.257 --> 01:01:13.757
They're small, people go home,

01:01:14.603 --> 01:01:15.499
like there's all these kinda

01:01:15.499 --> 01:01:17.916
gradations of responsibility.

01:01:18.594 --> 01:01:21.272
Question is do you want people to

01:01:21.272 --> 01:01:24.556
succeed or do you wanna treat incarcerated people

01:01:24.556 --> 01:01:26.354
like they're surplus population.

01:01:26.354 --> 01:01:28.388
You know that's the fundamental question

01:01:28.388 --> 01:01:29.249
that I'm trying to figure out

01:01:29.249 --> 01:01:31.358
how to get the powers to be to address

01:01:31.358 --> 01:01:32.728
in a way that's helpful.

01:01:32.728 --> 01:01:33.561
Cause it's not helpful when

01:01:33.561 --> 01:01:36.355
I just say this rhetorically to them.

01:01:36.355 --> 01:01:38.179
A lot of my work is about

01:01:38.179 --> 01:01:39.406
phrasing those rhetorical questions

01:01:39.406 --> 01:01:41.695
in slightly more engaging ways about you know,

01:01:41.695 --> 01:01:43.862
let's talk about like you know

01:01:43.862 --> 01:01:45.458
the Rwanda incarceration rate.

01:01:45.458 --> 01:01:49.075
Well let's talk about why it's so hard to visit.

01:01:49.075 --> 01:01:50.276
And you know let's not talk about

01:01:50.276 --> 01:01:52.849
what color the rug should be in the visiting room,

01:01:52.849 --> 01:01:54.599
let's talk about like

01:01:54.829 --> 01:01:56.104
the `groping` of the guards

01:01:56.104 --> 01:01:57.202
and like why that girl doesn't

01:01:57.202 --> 01:01:59.556
wanna ever visit her father again.

01:01:59.556 --> 01:02:00.945
Like let's talk about these structural things.

01:02:00.945 --> 01:02:03.152
And that's not what they really wanna hear

01:02:03.152 --> 01:02:04.137
cause they want my opinion on

01:02:04.137 --> 01:02:05.080
what color the carpet should be

01:02:05.080 --> 01:02:08.247
in the visiting room and it's like no.

01:02:08.456 --> 01:02:09.289
And we have to figure out

01:02:09.289 --> 01:02:11.289
how to have those conversations.

01:02:11.289 --> 01:02:13.872
Long answer to a good question.

01:02:16.135 --> 01:02:18.430
- [Female] Thank you for being here tonight.

01:02:18.430 --> 01:02:20.379
You prefaced your talk with saying

01:02:20.379 --> 01:02:21.869
the criminal justice system

01:02:21.869 --> 01:02:24.046
treats African Americans unfairly,

01:02:24.046 --> 01:02:27.129
but talked little about sort of those

01:02:28.034 --> 01:02:30.284
junctures that which fails,

01:02:30.641 --> 01:02:32.762
so I'd like to hear a little bit about more about that

01:02:32.762 --> 01:02:35.656
and how that differs from what you see

01:02:35.656 --> 01:02:38.989
as potentially differences in underlying

01:02:39.383 --> 01:02:41.383
actual incidences rights

01:02:42.844 --> 01:02:44.344
of the population.

01:02:45.599 --> 01:02:46.432
- So

01:02:47.614 --> 01:02:51.364
I decided to not talk just about that because

01:02:53.216 --> 01:02:54.549
what to do about it,

01:02:54.549 --> 01:02:56.701
it's a little bit more complicated

01:02:56.701 --> 01:02:57.602
and it gets really...

01:02:57.602 --> 01:02:58.884
The things that matter get

01:02:58.884 --> 01:03:01.301
really technical really fast.

01:03:01.880 --> 01:03:03.744
Let's just put something out there.

01:03:03.744 --> 01:03:06.827
Offense rates for many kinds of crime

01:03:06.977 --> 01:03:08.311
due appear to be higher

01:03:08.311 --> 01:03:10.121
for African Americas than for Whites.

01:03:10.121 --> 01:03:11.676
Notable exception drugs,

01:03:11.676 --> 01:03:13.210
depending on the drug type

01:03:13.210 --> 01:03:16.273
Whites use it more often than African Americans.

01:03:16.273 --> 01:03:18.540
Yet that does not explain the

01:03:18.540 --> 01:03:20.749
extremely large racial disparity in drug offenses.

01:03:20.749 --> 01:03:22.886
So that racial disparity and incarceration

01:03:22.886 --> 01:03:25.386
is highest in the drug context

01:03:26.174 --> 01:03:28.248
and that is a place where

01:03:28.248 --> 01:03:30.751
it is either equal or slightly higher for Whites.

01:03:30.751 --> 01:03:34.084
So that's like completely unjustifiable.

01:03:34.195 --> 01:03:35.028
And

01:03:36.415 --> 01:03:39.415
the problem is that the biases occur

01:03:39.973 --> 01:03:41.595
at all these different levels.

01:03:41.595 --> 01:03:44.428
Increased policing in communities,

01:03:44.893 --> 01:03:47.840
psychological bias is African American boys

01:03:47.840 --> 01:03:50.386
are more likely to be seen as dangerous

01:03:50.386 --> 01:03:51.219
because they're Black,

01:03:51.219 --> 01:03:54.593
are more likely to be seen as adults and more culpable.

01:03:54.593 --> 01:03:55.593
You have the

01:03:57.430 --> 01:04:00.263
sentences biases, you have like...

01:04:01.434 --> 01:04:02.917
And the Mother Jones piece about girls

01:04:02.917 --> 01:04:04.123
did a really nice job about this

01:04:04.123 --> 01:04:05.424
and about some of the biases that

01:04:05.424 --> 01:04:08.674
are like become structurally in placed.

01:04:09.454 --> 01:04:12.556
But what I'm losing the most sleep about right now

01:04:12.556 --> 01:04:16.277
is this concept of what's called risk assessment.

01:04:16.277 --> 01:04:18.694
Judges and how we decide bail

01:04:19.033 --> 01:04:21.616
is biased and we should instead

01:04:21.745 --> 01:04:23.611
figure out not their likely hood of

01:04:23.611 --> 01:04:24.770
being able to come up with money

01:04:24.770 --> 01:04:26.894
or their likely hood of showing up for trial,

01:04:26.894 --> 01:04:29.477
but their actual dangerousness.

01:04:30.229 --> 01:04:33.010
And we're gonna use a computer program

01:04:33.010 --> 01:04:34.401
and there's a bunch of different

01:04:34.401 --> 01:04:35.417
computer programs that do this.

01:04:35.417 --> 01:04:36.675
Some of them are confidential

01:04:36.675 --> 01:04:37.543
and you have to pay a license

01:04:37.543 --> 01:04:39.507
and you can't look at it.

01:04:39.507 --> 01:04:40.683
The computer program answers

01:04:40.683 --> 01:04:42.479
a bunch of questions then tells the judge

01:04:42.479 --> 01:04:44.562
release or don't release.

01:04:45.667 --> 01:04:47.981
Or some of them you can see the algorithm

01:04:47.981 --> 01:04:50.020
but what's the data that goes into this.

01:04:50.020 --> 01:04:52.615
And most of the people say we're using race...

01:04:52.615 --> 01:04:54.234
We're not using race as a factor.

01:04:54.234 --> 01:04:58.067
Well are you using a factor that is correlated

01:04:58.420 --> 01:04:59.253
with race.

01:05:00.063 --> 01:05:01.022
So it's not race

01:05:01.022 --> 01:05:03.662
but it's something that might as well be race.

01:05:03.662 --> 01:05:05.079
Like oh zip code.

01:05:05.312 --> 01:05:08.903
Zip code is a very strong predictor of re-offense.

01:05:08.903 --> 01:05:09.736
Well it's...

01:05:09.736 --> 01:05:11.209
Thank you racial segregation.

01:05:11.209 --> 01:05:13.733
That is a beautiful proxy for race.

01:05:13.733 --> 01:05:14.799
That is completely in my view,

01:05:14.799 --> 01:05:16.455
illegitimate criteria that many of these

01:05:16.455 --> 01:05:18.442
formulas are quite happy to use.

01:05:18.442 --> 01:05:19.275
And then

01:05:22.259 --> 01:05:23.317
other defenders these folks say

01:05:23.317 --> 01:05:25.649
we've tested our things, they're not racially bias

01:05:25.649 --> 01:05:27.343
or they're better than the current system.

01:05:27.343 --> 01:05:29.685
But it's like well how are you judging that,

01:05:29.685 --> 01:05:30.518
compared to what?

01:05:30.518 --> 01:05:32.722
Comparing to the current system,

01:05:32.722 --> 01:05:35.189
comparing to offense patterns,

01:05:35.189 --> 01:05:37.513
comparing to the demographics of the population.

01:05:37.513 --> 01:05:39.189
And when I ask this question

01:05:39.189 --> 01:05:40.198
the people developing these algorithms,

01:05:40.198 --> 01:05:42.047
I get met with blank looks.

01:05:42.047 --> 01:05:43.672
It's like oh this is not good.

01:05:43.672 --> 01:05:47.031
It's like your not even able to engage the question.

01:05:47.031 --> 01:05:48.631
Then the real question is how important

01:05:48.631 --> 01:05:50.374
is racial inequality to you

01:05:50.374 --> 01:05:51.207
because you're trying to build

01:05:51.207 --> 01:05:53.184
a robot to replace judges,

01:05:53.184 --> 01:05:55.101
and you can't even answer the question

01:05:55.101 --> 01:05:57.723
how important is racial inequality and inequity to you.

01:05:57.723 --> 01:05:59.640
And it's like uh oh and

01:06:01.701 --> 01:06:03.972
this is big dilemma and it's very technical

01:06:03.972 --> 01:06:04.994
but it's because...

01:06:04.994 --> 01:06:07.053
What I'm trying to figure out is

01:06:07.053 --> 01:06:08.574
the research does seem to say that these are

01:06:08.574 --> 01:06:10.761
less racially bias than the current

01:06:10.761 --> 01:06:12.426
status quo that judges use.

01:06:12.426 --> 01:06:14.537
But once we have a robot do this

01:06:14.537 --> 01:06:15.851
and we start jamming it through to

01:06:15.851 --> 01:06:16.849
more and more locations and paying

01:06:16.849 --> 01:06:20.239
less and less attention about how we're using it,

01:06:20.239 --> 01:06:23.328
will we still get that same slight improvement,

01:06:23.328 --> 01:06:25.398
and two will we have like permanently

01:06:25.398 --> 01:06:29.565
ensconced into the system a self perpetuating prophecy

01:06:29.784 --> 01:06:31.416
because if you decide to not give

01:06:31.416 --> 01:06:34.616
certain groups of people access to bail,

01:06:34.616 --> 01:06:35.540
you then make them more likely to

01:06:35.540 --> 01:06:37.634
plead guilty and go to prison.

01:06:37.634 --> 01:06:41.801
And that's what I'm not seeing that kinda worrying about

01:06:44.082 --> 01:06:44.915
and...

01:06:48.836 --> 01:06:51.512
And that's the kinda thing like I'm thinking about a lot.

01:06:51.512 --> 01:06:53.929
But all the different biases,

01:06:54.492 --> 01:06:56.533
you know the various stages of prosecution and like...

01:06:56.533 --> 01:06:59.700
We just did this interesting blog post

01:07:00.067 --> 01:07:01.492
about juvenile life without parole

01:07:01.492 --> 01:07:03.825
sentences and racial biases.

01:07:04.102 --> 01:07:05.299
And the reason I'm flagging this is because

01:07:05.299 --> 01:07:08.458
some researchers did this interesting thing.

01:07:08.458 --> 01:07:10.745
They ignored racial bias that existed

01:07:10.745 --> 01:07:13.377
before the police were involved,

01:07:13.377 --> 01:07:14.961
they took at the point of arrest.

01:07:14.961 --> 01:07:16.036
Let's just pretend that there's no

01:07:16.036 --> 01:07:19.369
racial bias for the sake of argument up to arrest.

01:07:19.369 --> 01:07:22.214
Let's just look at what the prosecutors and the judges do.

01:07:22.214 --> 01:07:25.297
And said oh look it's twice as likely

01:07:25.307 --> 01:07:27.007
that African American kids are gonna

01:07:27.007 --> 01:07:29.302
get a life without parole sentence.

01:07:29.302 --> 01:07:31.122
And I think it was useful but

01:07:31.122 --> 01:07:34.135
that makes this absolutely huge concession,

01:07:34.135 --> 01:07:35.410
like rhetorical concession,

01:07:35.410 --> 01:07:36.660
but then allows

01:07:38.246 --> 01:07:41.529
itself to put pressures on prosecutors and judges

01:07:41.529 --> 01:07:43.321
who are usually so happy to say,

01:07:43.321 --> 01:07:45.442
"We're perfect, it's the police

01:07:45.442 --> 01:07:47.692
"and I don't control them."

01:07:48.015 --> 01:07:50.059
But we really kinda struggled over this blog post

01:07:50.059 --> 01:07:52.308
because it was conceding something

01:07:52.308 --> 01:07:53.995
that was really important

01:07:53.995 --> 01:07:55.198
and probably bigger than the thing

01:07:55.198 --> 01:07:56.563
it chose to talk about.

01:07:56.563 --> 01:07:58.518
And I just haven't figured out how to

01:07:58.518 --> 01:08:00.685
come up with like a recipe

01:08:01.185 --> 01:08:05.162
for racial justice in the criminal justice system

01:08:05.162 --> 01:08:06.495
that's not about

01:08:08.542 --> 01:08:11.019
rebooting the entire criminal justice system.

01:08:11.019 --> 01:08:12.242
And I think the kinda question

01:08:12.242 --> 01:08:14.687
to judge criminal justice reformers

01:08:14.687 --> 01:08:16.668
is to try to figure out how important

01:08:16.668 --> 01:08:18.835
racial quality is to them.

01:08:19.481 --> 01:08:20.814
Cause I think...

01:08:21.018 --> 01:08:22.643
I'm not saying like oh

01:08:22.643 --> 01:08:24.679
let's make criminal justice reform

01:08:24.679 --> 01:08:25.512
about middle class White people,

01:08:25.512 --> 01:08:26.844
keeping middle class White people out of prison

01:08:26.844 --> 01:08:29.016
and then that's gonna magically reduce racial disparities.

01:08:29.016 --> 01:08:30.205
Like no it won't.

01:08:30.205 --> 01:08:32.521
It's lots a criminal justice reforms that'll do that.

01:08:32.521 --> 01:08:33.771
But what I'm...

01:08:34.026 --> 01:08:34.984
I'm giving a long answer cause

01:08:34.984 --> 01:08:38.897
I think about this a lot and I don't have an answer.

01:08:38.897 --> 01:08:40.727
Is to kinda figure out

01:08:40.727 --> 01:08:44.204
what people's goals are and trying to get people to

01:08:44.204 --> 01:08:45.658
put their goals into words.

01:08:45.658 --> 01:08:49.206
And I haven't figured out how to do that yet.

01:08:49.206 --> 01:08:50.416
And mostly cause the powers that be

01:08:50.416 --> 01:08:52.746
don't wanna have this conversation.

01:08:52.746 --> 01:08:54.771
But if anyone has any ideas I'm all yours.

01:08:54.771 --> 01:08:57.771
Now, tomorrow, next month, any time.

01:09:00.188 --> 01:09:02.557
Did I come close to answering your question?

01:09:02.557 --> 01:09:05.640
Alright, and I think I wore you down.

01:09:14.465 --> 01:09:15.918
- [Female] Hi, so my question

01:09:15.918 --> 01:09:17.548
also has to do with racial disparities

01:09:17.548 --> 01:09:19.316
within the criminal justice system.

01:09:19.316 --> 01:09:20.802
I think like one of the most frustrating things

01:09:20.802 --> 01:09:24.514
is seeing the discrepancies in prison sentences,

01:09:24.514 --> 01:09:26.627
especially like we've being seeing in the news lately

01:09:26.627 --> 01:09:30.081
between young, white men committing certain crimes

01:09:30.081 --> 01:09:33.147
and getting very short sentences for those crimes,

01:09:33.147 --> 01:09:35.524
and then young, black men committing the same crimes

01:09:35.524 --> 01:09:37.330
and getting much more severe sentences.

01:09:37.330 --> 01:09:38.163
So I was wondering if you think there's

01:09:38.163 --> 01:09:40.523
any way that, any possibility for us to like

01:09:40.523 --> 01:09:44.000
standardize prison sentences and get rid of that issue.

01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:46.631
- You're thinking like the Stanford rape case, right?

01:09:46.631 --> 01:09:47.464
Yeah,

01:09:47.999 --> 01:09:49.174
this is this question,

01:09:49.174 --> 01:09:51.591
so was the Stanford rape case

01:09:52.466 --> 01:09:53.998
an abuse of discretion

01:09:53.998 --> 01:09:57.331
or should more sentences look like that.

01:09:57.591 --> 01:09:58.837
Like that's like a fundamental question

01:09:58.837 --> 01:10:00.056
we have to kinda decide,

01:10:00.056 --> 01:10:03.523
is which one do we want to be the default.

01:10:03.523 --> 01:10:06.120
And that's where people don't agree.

01:10:06.120 --> 01:10:06.953
And,

01:10:09.022 --> 01:10:12.428
I'm in general not of fan of mandatory sentences,

01:10:12.428 --> 01:10:14.830
I'm a fan of giving judges discretion.

01:10:14.830 --> 01:10:15.663
Although,

01:10:17.139 --> 01:10:18.858
you know in the 19, Alright, we're in California.

01:10:18.858 --> 01:10:22.450
George Jackson, does that ring a bell for people.

01:10:22.450 --> 01:10:25.043
Black Panther killed in prison, okay no.

01:10:25.043 --> 01:10:28.293
Anyway made him political inside after,

01:10:28.322 --> 01:10:30.410
he got basically a life sentence

01:10:30.410 --> 01:10:33.580
for robbing $70 from a gas station in 1969.

01:10:33.580 --> 01:10:35.557
And because he was political

01:10:35.557 --> 01:10:36.938
they were never gonna let him out.

01:10:36.938 --> 01:10:38.760
But he did not have a life sentence

01:10:38.760 --> 01:10:40.732
because he was George Jackson, this black panther.

01:10:40.732 --> 01:10:42.798
He got a life sentence because everyone did.

01:10:42.798 --> 01:10:45.375
Everyone got sentences one year to life

01:10:45.375 --> 01:10:47.198
and just show us your good.

01:10:47.198 --> 01:10:49.865
And what people learned was that

01:10:50.054 --> 01:10:52.252
the parole board was racist and wouldn't give,

01:10:52.252 --> 01:10:54.057
wouldn't release African Americans.

01:10:54.057 --> 01:10:57.057
And so then we had this idea of like

01:10:57.504 --> 01:10:59.657
oh let's have mandatory sentences

01:10:59.657 --> 01:11:03.074
or sentences with a narrow guidelines and

01:11:03.933 --> 01:11:05.081
you know the sentences I think were

01:11:05.081 --> 01:11:07.564
longer than the people, the reformers wanted.

01:11:07.564 --> 01:11:09.638
I guess they wanted shorted to terminate sentences

01:11:09.638 --> 01:11:12.888
and we got long to terminate sentences.

01:11:12.912 --> 01:11:14.329
But I don't know,

01:11:14.337 --> 01:11:16.004
like I don't have...

01:11:16.549 --> 01:11:19.207
I go back and forth on how much discretion we want,

01:11:19.207 --> 01:11:21.517
but if we're gonna mechanize justice,

01:11:21.517 --> 01:11:22.476
I mean think about it this way.

01:11:22.476 --> 01:11:23.914
This is from this Norwegian

01:11:23.914 --> 01:11:26.267
criminologist named Nils Christie,

01:11:26.267 --> 01:11:28.661
the federal sentencing guidelines

01:11:28.661 --> 01:11:29.667
give you a bunch of points for the

01:11:29.667 --> 01:11:31.674
severity of the offense a long here,

01:11:31.674 --> 01:11:32.507
and then a bunch of things about

01:11:32.507 --> 01:11:34.206
your criminal record down here.

01:11:34.206 --> 01:11:36.108
Alright, so then the judges looks it up,

01:11:36.108 --> 01:11:37.376
give a sentencing in this narrow range

01:11:37.376 --> 01:11:38.526
and just use your discretion within

01:11:38.526 --> 01:11:41.234
this narrow range of a few months, give this sentence.

01:11:41.234 --> 01:11:42.152
You may as well replace the judge

01:11:42.152 --> 01:11:44.652
with a computer at this point.

01:11:48.251 --> 01:11:50.570
The guidelines say don't take race into account,

01:11:50.570 --> 01:11:51.728
don't take age into account,

01:11:51.728 --> 01:11:53.724
don't take education into account.

01:11:53.724 --> 01:11:55.224
I'll say, why not.

01:11:55.725 --> 01:11:56.821
You know, why don't take education,

01:11:56.821 --> 01:11:59.477
it's rhetorically, why not take education into account.

01:11:59.477 --> 01:12:02.881
You have a PhD, you should have known better.

01:12:02.881 --> 01:12:04.745
You didn't graduate from high school,

01:12:04.745 --> 01:12:06.420
our society owes you something

01:12:06.420 --> 01:12:08.069
cause our society, we promised you an education

01:12:08.069 --> 01:12:10.963
and we failed you, we should give you less.

01:12:10.963 --> 01:12:12.503
Maybe you end up with a negative sentence.

01:12:12.503 --> 01:12:14.534
I mean seriously, this is like

01:12:14.534 --> 01:12:16.920
if you're gonna mechanize these decisions

01:12:16.920 --> 01:12:19.400
to get away from individual biases,

01:12:19.400 --> 01:12:22.549
what are the criteria that you're gonna do that on?

01:12:22.549 --> 01:12:25.047
And that's something as a society,

01:12:25.047 --> 01:12:26.947
we need to come up with an answer to

01:12:26.947 --> 01:12:28.941
cause one doesn't exist.

01:12:28.941 --> 01:12:31.027
And anyone who says like oh we can just

01:12:31.027 --> 01:12:32.777
legislate away biases

01:12:34.198 --> 01:12:37.365
is lying or naive, and probably naive.

01:12:38.859 --> 01:12:42.026
But that's what we have to figure out.

01:12:42.237 --> 01:12:44.487
Hopefully that was helpful.

01:12:44.586 --> 01:12:45.687
- [Michael] Unfortunately that's all the time

01:12:45.687 --> 01:12:46.849
we have for questions.

01:12:46.849 --> 01:12:48.848
Please join me in thanking Peter Wagner.

01:12:48.848 --> 01:12:51.848
