00:00:07.990 --> 00:00:11.290
Hello and welcome to the This is Genius monday
show.

00:00:11.290 --> 00:00:17.060
Described in an internal company email as
"three stories of lightheratedness and weirdness."

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:19.880
Which I'm sure you'll agree is a pretty glowing
review!

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:24.289
So with that in mind and trying our best to
live up to those lofty expectations.

00:00:24.289 --> 00:00:25.980
This week, the Monday show features:

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:29.460
The annual my Korea is bigger than your Korea
competition.

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:32.180
Russia shuts off gas supply to everywhere
else.

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:33.750
Sorry, that's next week.

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:34.800
It's Earth day.

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:37.260
And Japanese whalers face a grilling in the
Hague.

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.610
And of course, your comments.

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:44.140
But first up to a small spit of land off the
edge of China, which, much like the appendix

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:47.920
it looks like, could be about to explode at
any second.

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:52.630
Yes, the time of year has come for South Korea
to invite all it's friends over for a big,

00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:57.480
loud party complete with rubbish fireworks,
much to the annoyance of grumpy, slightly

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:00.489
unhinged old man North Korea next door.

00:01:00.489 --> 00:01:04.280
The South's holding it's annual drills with
the US, which involve a lot of shouting and

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:10.060
showing off and making a big old mess and
they really need to check those exhausts.

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:14.090
As is the way with annual drills this big
old willy swinging competition is held every

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:18.399
year, and sees the South and US running around
freeing the hell out of some sand dunes and

00:01:18.399 --> 00:01:23.230
the North launching missiles at Japan, threatening
all out war, bombing the hell out of some

00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:25.180
birds near the border and making all it's
men have stupid haircuts.

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:34.009
Of course, no one's trying to wind anyone
up: SOT

00:01:34.009 --> 00:01:36.860
Which is why all of these drills are held
near the border.

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:40.899
Just so everyone can see how not provoking
they are.

00:01:40.899 --> 00:01:43.719
Look at all that not provocation both sides
are doing!

00:01:43.719 --> 00:01:47.829
And with so many men with guns running around
shooting at the sky, someone's inveitably

00:01:47.829 --> 00:01:53.499
going to get hurt, with cross border shelling
and retaliations common and, in the past,

00:01:53.499 --> 00:01:54.509
deadly.

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:58.780
This time, North Korea shot all hell out of
a bit of South Korea's sea, and the South,

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:03.469
determined to avenge the death of a bit of
water and some fish, bravely shelled the North

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:04.469
Korean sea.

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:09.100
Over 800 rockets and bombs were launched at
the sea, which must have been pretty peeved

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:13.140
with the whole thing since, really, it's done
nothing wrong.

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:17.890
The whole stupid waste of time cost millions
of dollars and saw thousands of people evacuated

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:22.110
into shelters, though fortunately no one was
hurt.

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:23.200
This time.

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:27.050
There probably isn't going to be another full
on war between the Koreas in the forseeable

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:28.050
future.

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:33.220
Because that would be really, really bad and
a lot of people would die, and no one would

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:35.470
win, and both sides know that.

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:40.110
But that's not much consolation for the poor
guys living near the border.

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:43.260
And the sea, won't someone think of the poor
sea?

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:47.370
And speaking of explosive little drops in
the ocean, it's time for your comments, and

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:52.040
you guys have been sharing your own stories
of near death experiences with us in the comments

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:56.130
section of our five people who should be dead
but aren't video.

00:02:56.130 --> 00:03:01.680
Special mentions go to Pika250 who got repeatedly
bitten by a diamond back rattlesnake and only

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:07.940
just lived to tell the tale, and cjurna, who
shared their story of helicopter crashes,

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:12.880
motorbike accidents, burst appendixes and
IED triggering.

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:15.700
Probably best you did leave the military!

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:18.980
If we managed to get the two of you together
with Frane Selak the rest of the world would

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:21.820
probably be swallowed by a black hole.

00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:25.200
And also thanks to the people who pointed
out some of the other stories of survival

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:29.420
we didn't include, I think a part two may
be in order here.

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:32.550
And now to some of the other stories we liked
from the last week and...

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:33.550
Oh...

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:35.010
Hello? Hmm.

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:39.170
No power for you,

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:40.910
No power for you,

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:42.760
No power for you.

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:45.980
Not that you were doing any work anyway decadent
westerners.

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:48.010
Whoa, whoa there.

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:51.970
This isn't Gazprom getting over excited at
all, it's Earth hour.

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:55.950
The one hour a year when we switch off all
those power-sapping lights and appliances

00:03:55.950 --> 00:04:00.690
and bask in the darkness to reflect on the
energy we waste and the damage we're doing

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:02.460
to mother nature.

00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:05.220
So, er...

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:06.600
Yeah.

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:07.980
Thinking.

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:09.360
Thinking.

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:11.140
Twiddling my thumbs.

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:18.930
Getting mighty bored now, ah thank god for
that, think I'm going to go and buy an oil

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:20.060
fired kettle.

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:25.050
Earth hour is a lovely idea, even if it does
mostly remind us how brilliant energy is and

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:26.599
how much we need it.

00:04:26.599 --> 00:04:30.979
And finally, Japan's "scientific" whaling
has come under the spotlight, with Australia

00:04:30.979 --> 00:04:35.970
taking the country to the Hague over it's
continuation of the practice.

00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:41.930
Whaling was banned in the 1980s, but Japan
uses a 1946 law as a loophole, which allows

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:44.360
unlimited whaling for scientific research.

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:49.479
Look, it must be for science, their boat has
'research' written on it.

00:04:49.479 --> 00:04:52.750
And look at all that research they're doing
into which bits taste the best.

00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:55.169
Mmm, delicious science.

00:04:55.169 --> 00:04:59.080
And it would be a shame if all that research
went to waste, so most of these science whales

00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:03.780
are recycled once they are done being analysed,
into food for Japanese consumers.

00:05:03.780 --> 00:05:10.479
See, not only is it improving our knowledge,
but nothing's been wasted either!

00:05:10.479 --> 00:05:15.009
Japan insists that it's whaling is geniunely
for research into stocks, and that it catches

00:05:15.009 --> 00:05:20.080
and kills 850 whales each year, providing
data that would allow the country to whale

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:24.169
without risking a repeat of past over-whaling
and stock depletion.

00:05:24.169 --> 00:05:28.979
So they're whaling to prove that whaling wouldn't
damage whale stocks, see?

00:05:28.979 --> 00:05:32.629
Activists on the other hand claim that the
data is meaningless, and that the whalers

00:05:32.629 --> 00:05:36.580
are merely whaling to whale, not to research
into whaling and what effect whaling would

00:05:36.580 --> 00:05:37.870
have on whales.

00:05:37.870 --> 00:05:42.689
Either way, both sides say they will abide
by the international courts' ruling.

00:05:42.689 --> 00:05:52.990
That's it for this week, check back for science
through the week and a top five on Friday.
