00:00:00.610 --> 00:00:04.250
Over the past two decades, the world has seen
the birth of ten new countries.

00:00:04.250 --> 00:00:05.924
Some have evolved out of violence or political
unrest, while others are the result of peaceful

00:00:05.924 --> 00:00:06.924
independence movements and diplomacy.

00:00:06.924 --> 00:00:08.730
So, what are some of the world’s youngest
countries?

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:16.180
Well, in Europe, the three newest countries
are Serbia, Montenegro and Kosovo.

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:20.840
Just three decades ago, these were all part
of one huge communist state, called Yugoslavia.

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:25.980
Throughout much of the 20th century, Yugoslavia
was ruled by Josip Broz Tito, whose autocratic

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:30.910
reign kept the country’s ethnically diverse
population and six self-governing republics

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:31.910
unified.

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:37.940
But upon Tito’s death in 1980, ethnic tensions
flared, and one-by-one, these republics became

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:39.190
sovereign states.

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:44.050
Two of them, Serbia and Montenegro, united
as a single nation in 1992.

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:48.540
But the unified Serbia and Montenegro quickly
ran into problems.

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:53.920
Although Montenegro was much smaller than
Serbia, its economy was stronger and proportionally,

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:56.260
contributed more than Serbia.

00:00:56.260 --> 00:01:00.360
Montenegrin leaders thought that independence
would further strengthen the economy, as well

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:04.360
as boost tourism and provide a faster path
into the European Union.

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:10.440
So, with a 2006 referendum, Montenegro split
from Serbia, forming two independent nations.

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:15.380
Meanwhile, tensions ran high in the southern
Serbian province of Kosovo.

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:19.780
This self-governing region was once the center
of Serbian culture and society.

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:24.090
But over the course of several centuries,
its population shifted toward predominantly

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:28.640
Muslim ethnic Albanians, replacing the mostly
Christian Serbs.

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:34.610
In the 1990s Serbia’s newly-elected president
attempted to “Serbianise” Kosovo, taking

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:39.200
control of its media, public offices, and
even its school curriculum.

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:43.860
. Ethnic Albanians fought back, carrying out
non-violent uprisings and, eventually, a major

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:47.560
guerilla offensive against Serbian police
and politicians.

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:51.580
Serbian forces responded with a ruthless ethnic
cleansing program.

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:57.189
Despite a 1999 NATO-led peace accord, violence
continued into the 21st century.

00:01:57.189 --> 00:02:03.290
Finally, in 2008, with US and EU support,
Kosovo broke away from Serbia, forming its

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:04.500
own country.

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:10.039
But even younger than these post-communist
states is South Sudan, which declared independence

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:11.730
in 2011.

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:17.090
Sudan and South Sudan had been at odds since
Sudan originally formed in 1956.

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:21.840
The conflict was due to a largely Christian
and non-Muslim south feeling unrepresented

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:24.650
and oppressed by the Arab and Muslim north.

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:30.099
After more than fifty years of conflict, including
two civil wars and an estimated two million

00:02:30.099 --> 00:02:35.610
Sudanese deaths, the north and south signed
a peace deal, granting secession for the south.

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:42.120
In a 2011 referendum, nearly 99 percent of
South Sudanese voters chose independence,

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:45.910
and the country quickly gained international
acceptance as a sovereign state.

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:51.310
However, South Sudan has since spiraled into
a brutal civil war, widespread poverty, and

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:53.550
an ongoing humanitarian crisis.

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:58.550
So whether it be in Africa, Europe or elsewhere,
the road to independence is almost never easy.

00:02:58.550 --> 00:03:01.530
Some countries, like Montenegro, have fared
much better on their own.

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:04.090
While others, like Kosovo, continue to struggle.

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:08.210
Kosovo is still far from accession to the
EU and is now one of the poorest countries

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:09.210
in Europe.

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:13.569
So, while going it alone may seem like the
logical escape from ethnic violence and political

00:03:13.569 --> 00:03:16.230
instability, autonomy is often its own beast.

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:19.420
