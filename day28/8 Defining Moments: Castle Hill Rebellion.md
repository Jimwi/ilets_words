Defining Moments: Castle Hill Rebellion

WEBVTT Kind: captions Language: en 

[Narrator] Five men are meeting under a flag of `truce`, somewhere near the current Sydney suburb of Rouse Hill. Major George Johnston of the New South Wales Corps and Trooper Thomas Anlezark face two Irish convicts, Philip Cunningham and William Johnston. Father James Dixon, an Irish jailbird who does a bit of Catholic priesting on the side, has accompanied Johnston to prevent bloodshed. And Johnston is concerned it’s his blood that might be `shed`, because on the hill behind the two unarmed Irish convicts are 250 more Irish convicts. Well, mostly Irish convicts, armed with guns, swords, `reaping hooks`, and pikes. Not those ones. Johnston is thinking a whole lot of rude words that we can't say in this video, because he has only 29 troops and 67 volunteers, and most of them are still marching through the bush. Johnston is in trouble, and so is the colony. Martial law has been declared for the first time in the continent’s history, with Australia never having come closer to being conquered by a hostile force. 

[Man and woman] Hey, what about us? 

[Narrator] Point taken. When Johnston demands that the convicts surrender, Cunningham responds: Death or liberty, and a ship to take us home! 

[Narrator] Johnston could have pointed out the logical inconsistencies in the Irish demand: If it’s death, you won’t need a ship. 

[Narrator] But he didn’t. Instead, he and Anlezark drew concealed `pistols` and held them to the rebel leaders’ heads. Then Johnston ordered his just arrived troops to fire on the suddenly leaderless Irish. 

[George] `Truce` schmuce. 

[Narrator] How had it come to this? To answer that question, we need to go back in time. 

In 1798, many Irish, inspired by the American and French Revolutions, rebelled against almost 200 years of British occupation and an even longer period of jokes at their expense. Catholics, `persecuted` by the ruling `Anglicans`, joined with republican Anglicans and `Presbyterians` to form the Society of United Irishmen. It didn’t help that the United Irishmen attacked the British with pikes, not those ones, while the British responded with guns and cannons. It also didn’t help that the rebels got cropped haircuts and wore brown coats to identify each other, as the British could identify them too. The Croppies, as the rebels became known, were crushed at the Battle of Vinegar Hill in June 1798. Several hundred Croppies, including Cunningham, Johnson, and Dixon, were sent to Sydney as convicts. In a colony of under 6,000 people, this caused a bit of a stir. Governor Hunter described the rebels as extremely `insolent`, `refractory` and `turbulent`, while his successor, Governor King, called them satanic. A few of the new arrivals continued to plot revolution, replacing funny haircuts, which had been a bit of a giveaway, with secret hand signals. And they secretly made pikes. Pikelets are not little pikes. 

News of another Irish rebellion reached Sydney in early 1804, with Irish weapons scientists having invented a folding pike — Hey, that one’s okay — `that could be concealed under a brown coat.` Cunningham didn’t know the 1803 Rebellion had failed, so he plotted to attack Parramatta and Sydney, plant a Tree of Liberty at Government House, seize a ship, and set sail for Ireland to join the revolution. A hut at Castle Hill was set alight to signal the uprising, with convicts overpowering their guards and raiding nearby settlements for arms, rum and recruits. 

The rum was a mistake, because drunk convicts got lost in the dark and failed to meet Cunningham for the attack on Parramatta. The rebel tasked with informing other convicts of the rebellion piked out, and instead informed the authorities. Cunningham abandoned the planned attack and retreated. And so we return to the scene of the broken truce. Johnston’s troops fired at the convicts, who broke and fled. About 30 were killed. Cunningham received a sword slash to the face and was hanged with eight `accomplices` the next day. Other rebels were flogged or sent to labour in the new coal mines at Newcastle. 

Republicanism had been defeated in both Ireland and the colony, with the skirmish that followed the Castle Hill Rebellion ironically named the Battle of Vinegar Hill. 

It would be 50 years before the Irish would again rise up at Eureka. But that’s another story.
