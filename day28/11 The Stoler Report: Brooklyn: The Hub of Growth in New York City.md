The Stoler Report: Brooklyn: The Hub of Growth in New York City

WEBVTT Kind: captions Language: en ♪♪[THEME MUSIC]♪♪ 

MICHAEL STOLER: It's Brooklyn, 2.4 million people. If it was a city it would be the fourth largest city in the country. It's a place where everybody wants to be. It's the hub of economy. It's manufacturing. It's retail. It's the place that I grew up, and today I have the guys who are going to talk to me about what's happening in Brooklyn. My guests, they include Andrew Kimball who is the CEO of Industry City, Albert Laboz who is the principal at United American Land, and, last but not least, the man who helped coordinate this, my executive producer and my buddy Tim King, who is the managing principal at CPEX Real Estate Services. So Albert and I are Brooklyn born and bred. He grew up in New Haven. You were originally born in Brooklyn too. 

ALBERT LABOZ: Where I spent most of my life. 

MICHAEL STOLER: So, Albert, have you seen this `resurrection`? I mean you grew up in the other side of Brooklyn. I mean what's going on today in downtown Brooklyn around the city? 

ALBERT LABOZ: You know I think what's happening is you're getting a lot more of the Manhattan-based residents coming to Brooklyn, and everything from the creative to the tech to the retail, the young, urban professional, they're coming to Brooklyn.  

MICHAEL STOLER: We have 11 colleges in downtown Brooklyn. You have a tech hub over there. You have something that this guy worked his rear off and did a great job at the Navy Yard where you have Steiner Studios. You have manufacturing. I remember Brooklyn, downtown Brooklyn was always the hub of retail, then it had a slow, but what's happening today? I mean talk about what you did with Sephora and the other stores. 

ALBERT LABOZ: So we bought the ground floor from RFP from the city of the Municipal Building on the corner of Court and Joralemon Street. It's 50,000 square feet, and it's been in dead zone since its inception in 1930s because it's a Municipal Building, so the city wanted to bring in some great retail, so we made a commitment to the city that we're not going to put in a pharmacy, a cell phone store, a bank, or fast food.  

MICHAEL STOLER: What else can you do then? 

ALBERT LABOZ: So of course they all call me up, and I couldn't put them in, but I really felt very strong about the location, and we brought Sephora. Sephora looked at it, and for 15 months they tortured me on a deal. I mean literally the deal died three times because they didn't believe in it, and I made a commitment to them. They said, "Listen, Al. We want a co-tenancy clause." I said, "Co-tenancy clause, what is this?" They said, "Co-tenancy means you're going to bring in great retail, so we're going to be paying percentage rent until you fill up the rest of the building with co-tenants." I'd never done that before, so I have the city on me. I have all eyes on me. I'm under a microscope. I said, "Okay, I have to make this deal for my anchor." So they moved in in November, and they're the first tenant there in 200 feet. There's no other retailer there, so they're open November, December, January, so we call them up and say, "Okay, where's my percentage rent?" "Oh no, we're not going to be paying you percentage rent." "Why?" "We're doing so much business there that the percentage rent far exceeds the base rent, so we're going to be paying base rent.  

MICHAEL STOLER: And now you have Neiman's coming in there, right? I mean Neiman Marcus, when did you ever think that a Neiman Marcus, even their discount level, would go to Brooklyn? But let's talk about Industry City. Now growing up also in Brooklyn I remember what we would call Bush Terminal. This was a place that I mean this massive building was built in, what, 1890, something like that? 

ANDREW KIMBALL: Early 1900s, 1900 to 1910 by Irving T. Bush, largest privately owned industrial site in the city, but let me go back a second. I was born in New Haven, but I spent the first 25 years of my life in Manhattan. My wife dragged me kicking and screaming out to Brooklyn 20, 25 years ago. I would never move back, and so I've seen a lot of this transition.  

MICHAEL STOLER: But let's talk about Industry City because Industry City was vacant for many, many years. I mean 4th Avenue, Sunset Park, there was the dividing line. There was the road, and people would say it's like when they had the Kmart. Originally there was supposed to be a Kmart, which became a Costco. 

ANDREW KIMBALL: That's right, so, like a lot of other privately owned, large, `industrial complexes`, `particularly on the waterfront`, over a 50 year period as manufacturing, traditional manufacturing, smokestack manufacturing, disappeared, went away, the previous owners really struggled to figure out what to do there, and, like a lot of other complexes, there was a lot of storage, a lot of low employment uses, very little investment in the deferred maintenance of these buildings, so that was the reason that the previous owners pulled together a new partnership about a year ago to `really reinvigorate the complex`. There's about $300 million of deferred maintenance work that we have to take on there. It's six million square feet of space, 16 buildings on 30 acres, and really what's just happened over the last 12 months is extraordinary. $100 million has gone in. We're working on replacing 1800 windows, upgrading 144 elevators, redoing the whole electrical infrastructure, and what's most important, the reason we're making this investment, is that this ownership group understands that there is this new `innovation` economy. It's a new way of looking at manufacturing, and it's really redefining it as the broad range of making a physical, a digital, and an engineer product, and those sectors in New York City, if you were to draw a circle around them, fastest growing sectors by far.  

MICHAEL STOLER: Now, you're going to have certain retail different than Albert's retail because it's going to be more of the `artisanal`, foods, and other situations. How are you doing on that right now? And I notice that you've had some events on the water. You've had some movie events. You had the tattoo event. You're having a lot of these things over there. 

ANDREW KIMBALL: The primary focus on the retail initially is retail that is an `amenity` for the businesses moving in there, so you mentioned the BQE, and that has been the natural dividing line between the residential side of Sunset Park and the working waterfront. We need to create places that people can come get something to eat, for instance, in these buildings, so, as we go for 2400 employees where we were last August to 3600 today to 15,000, where we hope to be in another eight years, there need to be interesting places for people to go eat, so one of our key focuses initially on the retail front has been providing actually an industrial product to small commercial kitchens. The whole artisanal food business is taking off, farm to table, so we provide industrial space, but we ask these businesses to do a retail window there, so it's their secondarybusiness. Their core business is-  

MICHAEL STOLER: But it's a showcase over there. I remember a number of years ago you and I, we went to Industry City. We were riding around on Sunset Park. I mean you could rent that space for $5, for $8, nobody was moving in. You had the storage facility for many companies. This was dead storage. There was no heat. There was nothing else over there, so how do you see Brooklyn? Albert and I were talking prior to the show, where can growth be and where Brooklyn might not have growth because East New York is one of the areas that may not have that potential growth today, Coney Island, because you also need transit-oriented development, and that's the key why downtown Brooklyn is so valuable. I mean one of the negatives and difficulties originally of the Navy Yard was the transit. How is the transit today to Industry City? 

ANDREW KIMBALL: Well the transit to Industry City far exceeds that at the Navy Yard and look at the Navy Yard, 4 and a half million square feet of space, full, a waiting list of 100 businesses trying to get in there, so that's with difficult mass transit. Down at Industry City, you've got the N, R, and the D express trains from Manhattan coming a block from our facility, so that is a real plus. We want to see bike lanes coming down there. We want to see city share, bike share come in. We want to see ferry service come in to the end of 39th St, and we think that working in partnership with the de Blasio of Administration in the coming years and the community we can make those kinds of things happen.  

MICHAEL STOLER: Timmy, what's happening? What do you see? Because you've been touching all parts of Brooklyn. 

TIM KING: I want to go back to your point about that there's areas where you may see no growth. I think it's more appropriate to say that there might be somewhat slower growth there but I don't think there's any part of Brooklyn that someone who made an investment today wouldn't feel good about it in 5 or 10 years from now. If you think about an analogy between the stock market and the Brooklyn real estate market, you could buy a stock today or bought it 10 years ago, and it can vaporize. That money can go away, but someone who bought in what may be considered the worst part of Brooklyn 10 years ago probably looks like a genius today, and I think Industry City's probably a very good example, and Albert's family, now, if you think about it, these guys went through the tough times in downtown and are today reaping the benefits of their vision. 

MICHAEL STOLER: I think the report came out recently, the 10-year report on downtown Brooklyn, and one of my good friends is Josh Muss. He was the first hotel, and that was a struggle. That was really saying you know, hey, we're going to open up a Marriott over here? Now you have about 15 hotels. 

TIM KING: Not just that, the Marriott is so overbooked at downtown Brooklyn they send their overflow to Manhattan. Think about that. 

MICHAEL STOLER: So you have that. Now one of the things that you need, which is what Andrew was saying and Albert and I were talking about it before is you need to have additional `amenities`. You need the restaurants. Now you have the capability that you can offer a `restaurateur` or a small boutique type of place a reasonable rent. Albert can't afford, based on the economy, to offer the good quality restaurant that type- 

ALBERT LABOZ: Well a couple things. First of all, yeah, you won't have it on Fulton St, or you won't have it on the main drag, but on the approaches, under Bridge St, on Duffield St, on Hoyt St, I mean those are prime locations. They're not going to be cheap, but they'll pay $75 a foot, and I think those are the places where you're going to have the restaurants because you have all these apartment buildings going up. They have to meet this demand, and people want, they want your bars. They want restaurants. They want places to hang out, and that's what's lacking, and that's what's going to come. 

ANDREW KIMBALL: And I would even add the Gowanus into that, which really connects downtown to over to Sunset Park, and you look at what's happening in the Gowanus. It's extraordinary. The restaurants there along Third Avenue are exploding. 

MICHAEL STOLER: But you know one of the partners who you're with, Jamestown, when they were involved, and they're still are involved with the Chelsea Market. Chelsea Market, when Irwin Cohen took it over, no one wanted to be there. This was a neighborhood that was undesirable, and now it wasn't far away from the train, but it was an undesirable neighborhood, and there's been a growth over there. Where do you see, what's happening in MetroTech today? Are we seeing additional growth? Because people want hip offices. People want to be in unique locations, and MetroTech is more of a standard office type. 

TIM KING: Almost all of downtown Brooklyn is your classic office space, if you will. When downtown Brooklyn was purely a central business district, and it was bureaucracies, government agencies, attorneys, that was the classic office building that people wanted. The tenant who's coming in, the tenant that Andrew was targeting, that tech tenant, is looking for space that's entirely different from that, and I expect that you're going to see some spec office building happening on the fringe of downtown, and MetroTech itself is going to undergo a `metamorphosis`.  

MICHAEL STOLER: I mean with what Vesco, Cushner are doing down in Dumbo Heights, that's going to be a unique type of office space. 

TIM KING: There's no question about that. We're helping them with the retail part of that, and we're having some extraordinary experiences. The demand for tenants for that type of space is just literally off the charts. 

ALBERT LABOZ: You know last year downtown Brooklyn partnership hosted a meeting with all the tech tenants, the CEOs of the tech tenants and the real estate industry, and, for me, it was an eye opener, and for a lot of real estate guys an eye opener, because the tech tenants are looking for something different than the traditional tenant. They need 24-hour access. They don't care so much about security. They don't care about a fancy lobby. They just want a nice, big open space. 

MICHAEL STOLER: High ceiling. 

ALBERT LABOZ: High ceiling, they want to bring their dog. They need a place for their bicycles, and they want great places to eat, and service that's accessible 24/7 because they're going to come in at 10:00 at night and work through the night on a creative project, which is not your traditional 9:00-5:00 office use. 

MICHAEL STOLER: What do you see, what about Green Point? Is that the next horizon? I mean Green Point is an interesting place. I mean Williamsburg, it's too expensive today to develop. I mean the Whole Foods that's going to be opening over there is probably going to be packed all the time, and they can have another need, and I think part of that, but is Green Point the area? Is it Clinton Heights? Now that we have these people who live and work over there, what do you see? 

TIM KING: It's going to get pushed further and further out, but I want to go back a minute to the question that you raised about the office space and that Albert touched on. I think a huge untapped opportunity to draw that class of tenant we're talking about is upper floor space on Fulton Street. There's hundreds of thousands of square feet of space that was shuttered, sealed up 20, 30 years ago and had been sitting dormant all that time, and I think that someone could put together a critical mass of combining a few buildings, and it's not an expensive building. 

ALBERT LABOZ: The big challenge with that is, in retail, is on Fulton street go for $300 a foot. It's a 25-foot building, and you're taking away seven, eight feet away. 

TIM KING: For the lobby. 

ALBERT LABOZ: And then you're putting in an elevator and a core and staircases and what have you, so this is something I've been talking about also about working with the DOB and maybe combining multiple buildings, three, four, five six buildings at the same time, and you have one entrance on one side and an egress on the other side, and then you could do an RFP to a developer for the upper floors, because they're just shuttered, vacant, cold storage spaces that are totally unused. 

TIM KING: But I think would be attractive to the tenants that you're talking about. 

ALBERT LABOZ: Absolutely, 1000%. 

ANDREW KIMBALL: Yeah, I think a lot of those, they've got high ceilings. They've got big windows. They've got some interesting architecture, and I think that's what we saw at the Navy Yard and we're seeing down at Industry City. I think you're seeing at the former Watchtower buildings that this new, creative class, they want to make things again, whether it's physical or digital. They want to be in buildings with good bones. They want to be able to live near to where they work. The last thing they want to be is in a suburban, commercial, industrial park. You see the same phenomenon in San Francisco. The tech businesses now want to be in downtown San Francisco. People don't want to have to drive 45 minutes to a suburban campus, plus they don't want to be in the traditional office buildings that their parents worked in. They want to be in these buildings with good bones. 

MICHAEL STOLER: Residential, you have a little residential. How do you see residential in Brooklyn today, Albert? 

ALBERT LABOZ: On fire, just in the land pricing trading right now, where three, four years ago the highest land buildable was trading at 100, $150 a buildable foot, now it's over 350 a buildable foot, so it's just on fire.  

MICHAEL STOLER: What about incentives? Albert was talking, because I mean, look, the Navy Yard had incentives. Downtown Brooklyn's had incentives to improve the area. Do you believe that the city needs additional incentives to get even things getting better? I mean Brooklyn is doing well as I said as an economic hub, but I mean at one time you need 421As. You need a tax abatement, so the way a number of these apartment houses that are being built in Brooklyn, an they're very proud to say that there are about 550 affordable units because AD20. That's an important hub. Do you see tax incentives being created to help some of the businesses? No real estate taxes or a phased-in situation in Brooklyn? 

ALBERT LABOZ: You know what the big mystery is is that, when the city did the `rezoning` 10 years ago, what they did is double the rezoning, and why did they do it? Because they want to compete with Jersey City for office space, because they're losing all our jobs to Jersey City. Nobody dreamed that the FAO would turn residential, so now the problem is that there's not enough space to meet the demand now for the new technology tenant, so now we're talking to City Hall, the downtown Brooklyn partnership, as giving different ideas to developers now. How could we bring more FAR and more development for this new technology customer? And the ideas are basically like this, okay, we could go ahead and let's say a building of 12 FAR, add another three free FAR so you could build spec office building for this new tenant, because right now the vacancy rate in downtown Brooklyn I think is down to 4.0%.  

MICHAEL STOLER: But here's an interesting idea. You take Industry City which has all of these buildings. People like living on the water. I mean look at Williamsburg and what's going to happen with Dumbo, not Dumbo Domino, and you take this situation and you take maybe some of the buildings. Could you see a rezoning or a change in Industry City where people would be living as a residential? Because right now it's commercial. It's completely commercial. 

ANDREW KIMBALL: Short answer is no, but I think there is capacity and much needed affordable housing, mixed income housing, needed for Sunset Park upland from the BQE. I think, as Al was saying, there is this tremendous dearth now of space for creative types, and I don't necessarily like the word office because people think that means just a bunch of guys from Wall Street sitting in a space or some kind of back office bank space. No, it's this high employment creative designers, techies, production. That's the kind of creative office space that we're creating in Industry City, and we really are becoming the affordable option, but, as Al pointed out, it's still not enough, and you need to do creative things where you up zone, and you look at more live-use, mixed space.  

MICHAEL STOLER: Yeah, but I see the live-use on the water over there in Sunset Park, in Industry City. 

TIM KING: What's going to happen on the Gowanus Canal of all places?  

MICHAEL STOLER: That's exactly right. Look at the Gowanus Canal. No one ever thought over there. I mean Whole Foods. I mean Toll Brothers got stopped. That was timing. Everything was timing because of the economy and everything else. Now, you live in Brooklyn. Do you see any changes perhaps in the Flatbush section, in other areas in Brooklyn? 

ALBERT LABOZ: It's always been slow and steady, strong, high demographic, always staying, no great changes. It's always been strong, so I always call it the uncool part of Brooklyn, but it's always been that way.  

MICHAEL STOLER: But he lives in Park Slope. You're in the cool. I mean the Slope today, in Kensington, in other areas. 

TIM KING: Part of the reason why Flatbush can't become cool or it's going to take longer is it's such a mature marketplace. Everything that's there is built. `It's the fringe areas`, the underutilized space where people can come in and make a radical change that really-  

MICHAEL STOLER: You look at this, you take related what they did, and part of it's with the Hudson in Starrett City or Gateway over there. Gateway has an affordable, and then they have a lot of retail in that situation, and, as we said prior to the show, Brooklyn and the entire New York City is under retail. 

ALBERT LABOZ: Can I give you an example about when people say that. Brooklyn has 2.4 million people, fourth largest city in the country like you said before. If you look at Nassau and Suffolk, Long Island, 2.6 million people, they have about six, seven, eight regional malls. Each one had Victoria's Secret, the Gap, Banana Republic. There are nine Banana Republics on Long Island, one in Brooklyn. Ten Victoria's Secrets in Long Island, two in Brooklyn. Twelve Gaps, two in Brooklyn. Come on. 

TIM KING: Opportunity.  

MICHAEL STOLER: But look at the testament. Where is one of the highest grossing targets in the world? Brooklyn. And where's the second one? In Brooklyn. 

TIM KING: And the Costco that's right next to us is the highest grossing Costco in the United States.  

MICHAEL STOLER: Because there's a need. I mean, look, the Costco, which literally as we said was supposed to be a Kmart, and it's an unusual thing. It's a two-level Costco, which is totally different. 

TIM KING: With crazy parking.  

MICHAEL STOLER: With literally crazy parking, an egress and an offset. What about the hospitality, the hotel business? I mean, as I was saying, before we only had one. Today we probably have 14 hotels. Is the DNC thinking of coming into getting over there? The Barclays Center has resurrected the area. The BAM expansion is growing over there. What about Bushwick, retail in Bushwick? I mean Bushwick has always had a good retail, right, Albert? 

ALBERT LABOZ: Right now it's restaurants in Bushwick. We have to be careful to make sure the national tenants and really the same with Williamsburg that they don't be a victim of their own successes. So once they start the banks and the pharmacies come in and they start killing it, so they have to be curated the right way.  

MICHAEL STOLER: He's putting a CVS and a Walgreen's over there. The best stories, when I do shows about Manhattan, and people say, "You know what? I remember when pharmacies were pharmacies where there was a pharmacist and it was a small little store," and I don't even want to say I do remember when they had soda fountains because we talk about other shows, but we're talking about pharmacies and not pharmacies. They're multi-purposes stores. The only thing that they aren't selling are dresses and clothing, but they are selling all type of food products. They're all 24/7. It's a totally different environment. 

TIM KING: I remember reading 10 years ago the then president or CEO or Walgreen's making the announcement that he wanted his stores to be the most convenient place in town to buy milk, and it makes your point, like you're going to go to a drug store to buy milk, but, yeah.  

MICHAEL STOLER: But one of the `deficiencies` today for Brooklyn besides the retail over there I believe is the deficiency of adequate amount of health care because Brooklyn is 2.4 million people, but literally you don't have that many major medical centers. It's Maimonides who is the key to the hospital of Brooklyn. Brooklyn Hospital is there. It's growing a little better, but maybe, with what's supposed to be going on at the LICH, with NYU over there, do you see more, and this is becoming booming around the country, the urgent care centers? Are you seeing that? 

ALBERT LABOZ: We get a lot of calls from major hospitals looking for say 30, 35, 40,000 square feet, space for `ambulatory` care or special centers that deal with out-patient, so they're looking. `The problem is there's such a dearth of space available, but it's going to come because they're out there looking.  `

MICHAEL STOLER: Now you got the Nets, right? 

ANDREW KIMBALL: I got the Nets. We also have Lutheran Medical Center I'll just point down there that's a very strong hospital. And Methodist nearby, but, yes, we do have the Nets. We're very excited about that. Those conversations went on for multiple years, but a deal is now signed. Cranes are arriving imminently. A $50 million project.  

MICHAEL STOLER: Now is that on top of the building? 

ANDREW KIMBALL: It's going to be on the eighth floor of building 19 with spectacular knock your socks off views back at Manhattan, and then it'll pop through the roof with a double height, two practice facilities. They'll have workout facilities, treatment facilities. They'll have an events space. It'll be really a spectacular feature for Industry City. It'll move 70 jobs over from Jersey. It'll create great local partnerships for kids, for clinics. We're really excited about that from a place making point of view.  

MICHAEL STOLER: And I'm really excited that, Timmy brought together two great guys to talk about Brooklyn, and, hopefully, as we start today the beginning of the 14th season, you'll come back again, and we'll talk more about Brooklyn manufacturing, retail, and what's happening. I'd like to thank Andrew Kimball, Albert Laboz, and my buddy Tim King, and I'll see you next week.
