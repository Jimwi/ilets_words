(APPLAUSE)


<i>Thank you very much
and welcome to</i> To Tell the Truth.


<i>Our first guest, he's made a career out
of being the most outrageous `impostor`</i>


<i>that we've ever come across
on this show. You'll see what I mean.</i>


ANNOUNCER: <i>Number One,
what is your name, please?</i>


<i>My name is Frank William Abagnale.</i>


<i>- Number Two?
- My name is Frank William Abagnale.</i>


<i>- Number Three?
- My name is Frank William Abagnale.</i>


HOST: <i>From 1964 to 1967,</i>


<i>I successfully impersonated
an airline pilot for Pan Am Airways,</i>


<i>and I flew over two million miles
for free.</i>


<i>During that time,</i>


<i>I was also the Chief Resident
Paediatrician at a Georgia hospital</i>


<i>and an Assistant `Attorney` General
for the State of Louisiana.</i>


<i>By the time I was caught,</i>


<i>I was considered the youngest and most
daring con man in U.S. history.</i>


<i>I had cashed almost $4 million
in fraudulent cheques</i>


<i>in 26 foreign countries and all 50 states.</i>


<i>And I did it all before my 19th birthday.</i>


<i>My name is Frank William Abagnale.</i>


(APPLAUSE)


<i>So, for the first time,
he'll have to tell the truth.</i>


<i>We'll start our questioning with Kitty.</i>


<i>Thank you. Number One,
why, with all your talent,</i>


<i>and you're obviously
a very bright fellow,</i>


<i>why didn't you go in for
a legitimate profession?</i>


<i>It was a question of dollars and cents.</i>


<i>When I was a young man,
I needed the money,</i>


<i>and I thought this list of careers was
the easiest way to get it.</i>


KITTY: <i>I see. Number Two,
I find this all very fascinating.</i>


<i>Who was it that finally caught you?</i>


<i>His name was Carl Hanratty.</i>


(POLICEMEN STRUGGLING

Hanratty.

(QUESTIONING IN FRENCH)


I have orders to see
the American prisoner, Abagnale.

You do not open the door.


You do not pass him

(FRANK COUGHING)


Aw, Jesus.


(WATER DRIPPING)


(FRANK CONTINUES COUGHING)


(SPITS)


You know,
I've got a little bit of a cold myself.


(INTENSE COUGHING)


Frank, I'm here to read
the articles of `extradition`


according to the European Court
for Human Rights.


"Article One,


"extradition shall be granted
in respect of offences..."


Help me.


Help me.


Frank, stop it.


Help me.


You don't think
you're actually going to fool me, do you?


(COUGHING)


Sixteen pages to go.
Stay with me. "Article Two,


"if the request for extradition
includes separate offences...


"...each of which is punishable under
the laws of the requesting party..."


Frank?


Frank?


God damn it!


Get me a doctor in here!
I need a doctor!


- Yes.
- Doctor! Now!


Don't sweat it.
We'll get you right to a doctor.


(HEAD POLICEMAN
SPEAKING FRENCH)


If you can hear me, don't worry.
I'll take you home in the morning.


Home in the morning, Frank.


- What are you doing?
- Washing off the lice.


This man has to be on a plane
for America. He has to see a doctor.


Yes, the doctor comes in tomorrow.


I've worked too long, too hard,
for you to take this away from me.


If he dies, `I'm holding you responsible.`


(DOOR CREAKING)


(CALLS IN FRENCH)


Oh, Frank.


(LOUD CLAMOUR)


(COUGHING VIOLENTLY)


(POLICEMEN SHOUTING)


Okay, Carl,


let's go home.


BARNES:
<i>The New Rochelle Rotary Club</i>


<i>has a history that goes back to 1919.</i>


<i>In all those years,</i>


<i>we've only seen a handful of deserving gentlemen</i>


<i>`inducted` as lifetime members.</i>


<i>It's an honour that has seen 57 names</i>


<i>enshrined on the wall of honour.</i>


<i>And tonight, we make it 58.</i>


<i>So please stand</i>


<i>as I present my very good friend, a man who keeps our pencils sharp</i>


<i>- and our pens in ink.</i>
- (ALL LAUGHING)


<i>Frank William Abagnale.</i>


<i>I stand here, humbled</i>


<i>by the presence of Mayor Robert Wagner</i>


<i>and our club president, Jack Barnes.</i>


<i>Most of all, I'm honoured to see my loving wife, Paula</i>


<i>and my son, Frank, Jr.</i>


<i>Come on.</i>


<i>Sitting in the front row.</i>


<i>Two little mice fell in a bucket of cream.</i>


<i>The first mouse quickly gave up and `drowned`.</i>


<i>The second mouse</i>


<i>wouldn't quit.</i>


<i>He struggled so hard</i>


<i>that eventually he churned that cream into butter</i>


<i>and crawled out.</i>


<i>Gentlemen, as of this moment, I am that second mouse.</i>


<i>(EMBRACEABLE YOU</i> PLAYING)


PAULA: You're a better dancer
than your father.


FRANK: Hear that, Daddy?
FRANK, SR.: Like fun.


PAULA: The girls don't know
what they're in for.


(FRANK LAUGHING)


Show him the dance you were doing
when we met.


PAULA: Oh, who can remember?


The people in that little French village
were so happy to see Americans,


they decided to put on a show for us.


- So they crammed 200 soldiers...
- We know the story, Daddy.


...into that tiny social hall,


and the first person to walk on stage
is your mother


and she starts to dance.


You know, it had been months


since we'd seen a woman,
and here's this blond angel.


Blond bombshell.


(LAUGHING)


And the men
are literally holding their breath.


Holding their breath for you. Hear that?


I turned to my buddies and I said...


"I will not leave France without her."


And I didn't.


You didn't.


I didn't.


Oh, shit, the rug.


- Oh, Mom.
- I can't believe I...


It's nothing.


- Frankie, run and get a towel.
- Yeah.


Come on.


Dance with me, Paula.


<i>(EMBRACEABLE YOU</i>
CONTINUES PLAYING)


Whenever I dance for you,
I get in trouble.


Oh! (LAUGHS)


Frank. Wake up. Come on, let's go.


Get up, come on.


- Frank, wake up.
- Dad.


You don't have to go to school today.
It's okay.


- Why? Is it snowing?
- Do you have a black suit?


I overslept again.


We have a very important meeting
in the city. Eat that.


Come on.


FRANK, SR.: Ma'am, open up, please.
It's important.


- (POUNDING ON DOOR)
- What? Oh, gosh.


- We don't open for half an hour.
- Just open the door. It's important.


I'm sorry, we don't open for half an hour.


What's your name, ma'am?


- Darcy.
- Darcy. That's a pretty name.


I'm in a fix. I need a suit for my kid.
This is my son, Frank.


He needs a black suit.


There was a death in the family.
My father, 85 years old, war hero.


There's a funeral this afternoon,
military funeral,


planes flying overhead, 21-gun salute.


Frank needs to borrow a suit
for a couple of hours.


I'm sorry,
we don't loan suits and we're not open.


Darcy, please. Come back.


(SIGHS)


Darcy, is this yours?


I just found it in the parking lot.


Uh-huh.


Must have slipped right off your neck.


(TYRES SCREECHING)


FRANK, SR.: Don't hit the `kerb`.


Now get out, walk around the back
and hold the door open for me.


(CAR HORN HONKING)


- What's next?
- Okay. Stop `grinning`.


When I get inside,
go back to the front seat and wait.


Even if a cop comes
and writes you a ticket,


don't move the car, understood?


Dad, what's all this for?


You know why the Yankees always win?


Because they have Mickey Mantle?


No, it's because the other teams can't
stop staring at those damn pinstripes.


Watch this. The manager
of Chase Manhattan Bank


is about to open the door for your father.


Mr Abagnale,


we don't usually loan money to people


who have unresolved business
with the IRS.


That's a misunderstanding.
I hired the wrong guy to do my books.


A mistake anybody could make.


I just need you guys
to help me weather the storm.


You're being investigated
by the government for tax fraud.


(SIGHS) My store is
a landmark in New Rochelle.


I have customers all over New York.


You're not a customer
at Chase Manhattan.


We don't know you.


I'm sure your bank in New Rochelle
could help you out.


My bank went out of business.


Banks like this one
put them out of business.


I know I made a mistake, I admit that.
But these people want blood.


They want my store.
They've threatened to put me in jail.


This is America, right?
I'm not a criminal.


I'm a Medal of Honour winner. A member
of the New Rochelle Rotary Club.


All I'm asking is
for you to help me beat these guys.


It's not a question of winning and losing,
it's a question of risk.


You're the largest bank in the world.
Where's the...


Where's the risk?


How could you let him
take our car like that?


He didn't take anything, we took him.
He overpaid by 500.


Come on, Frank. Let's return the suit.


(PAULA WEEPING)


This place is good.


It's small, but it's gonna be
a lot less work.


A lot less work for you.


FRANK: Hey, Dad.


Hi.


Where is your mother?


I don't know.


She said something
about going to look for a job.


What's she going to be,
a shoe salesman at a centipede farm?


(BOTH LAUGHING)


What are you doing?


You want some pancakes?


For dinner? On my son's 16th birthday?


We're not going to eat pancakes.


Why are you looking at me like that?
You thought I forgot?


- I didn't think you forgot.
- I opened a checking account


in your name.


I put $25 in the account
so you can buy whatever you want.


- Don't tell your mother.
- I won't.


Thanks, Dad.


Didn't that bank turn you down
for a loan?


Yes, they all turned me down.


Then why you opening
a banking account with them?


Because one day, you'll want
something from these people.


A house, a car...


They have all the money.


There's 50 cheques there, Frank,


which means, from this day on,


you're in their little club.


I'm in their little club.


You got that, you got it all.


It's even got my name there.


- To the moon.
- To the moon. (CHUCKLES)


To the moon.


(BELL TOLLING)


See that? It's just a school.


No different than Westbourne.


Ma, you said you were going to quit.


Frankie, you don't have to wear
the uniform here.


Why don't you take off your jacket?


I'm used to it.


- Excuse me.
- Yes?


Do you know where room 17,
French is?


Yeah...


(BOTH LAUGHING)


(BELL RINGING)


(STUDENTS CHATTERING)


You selling encyclopaedias?


He looks like a substitute teacher.


Quiet down, people!


My name is Mr Abagnale!


- (GROANS)
- That's Abagnale, not Abagnolee,


not Abagnelee, but Abagnale.


Now, somebody please tell me
where you left off in your textbooks.


Excuse me, people.
If I need to ask again,


I'm gonna write up the entire class.


Take your seats!


Chapter seven.


Would you please open your textbooks
to chapter eight


and we'll get started.


- Excuse me. What's your name?
- Brad.


Why don't you get up here


in front of the class
and read conversation number five?


(READING POORLY IN FRENCH)


(STUDENTS LAUGHING)


They sent for me.


They said they needed
a sub for Roberta.


I came all the way from Dixon.


I always sub for Roberta.


Excuse me, why aren't you reading?


I'll never come back
to Bellarmine-Jefferson again!


You tell them not to call me.


Do they think it's easy
for a woman my age


and all the money that it costs to travel?
I tell you, they don't give a damn.


Mr and Mrs Abagnale,


this is not a question
of your son's attendance.


I regret to inform you
that for the past week,


Frank has been teaching
Mrs Glasser's French class.


He what?


Your son has been pretending to be
a substitute teacher.


Lecturing the students,
giving out homework...


Mrs Glasser has been ill,


and there was some confusion
with the real sub.


Your son held
a teacher-parent conference yesterday


and was planning a class field trip


to a French bread factory in Trenton.


Do you see the problem we have?


I've a note to miss fifth and sixth period
today. Doctor's appointment.


- (PHONE RINGING)
- One moment. I'll be right with you.


- You should fold it.
- What?


That note. It's a fake, right?
You should fold it.


It's a note from my mom.
I have a doctor's appointment.


Yeah, but there's no `crease`
in the paper.


When your mom hands you a note
to miss school,


the first thing you do is fold it
and put it in your pocket.


If it's real, where's the crease?


(BELL RINGING)


Frankie.


(BOTH LAUGHING)


Ma, I'm home.


(SOFT MUSIC PLAYING)


Remember that girl Joanna
I was telling you about?


I asked her out today.


Think we're going to go
to the junior prom.


- (MUSIC STOPS ABRUPTLY)
- Ma, is this my driver's licence?


That's all there is, two bedrooms.


Frankie.


You remember Dad's friend?


Jack Barnes. From the club.


Hello.


He came by looking for your father.


I was giving him a tour of the apartment.


(STAMMERING)
It's very spacious, Paula.


Dad is at the store.


So, Frank,


you're getting to look
more like your old man every day.


Thanks for the sandwich, Paula.


- I'll see you later.
- Wait.


Is this yours?


Oh.


Thanks, Frank.
That's the President's pin.


I'd be in deep trouble if I lost that.


I'll see you all later.


Are you hungry, Frankie?
I'll make you a sandwich.


Jack wanted to talk business
with your father.


He thinks we should get a lawyer
and sue the government.


That it's not legal,
what they're doing to us.


Why aren't you saying anything?


You're not going to tell him, are you?


No.


That's right. There's nothing to tell.


I'm going out for a few hours to visit
some old friends from the tennis club.


When I get home,
we'll all have dinner together.


Right?


But you won't say anything
because it's just silly,


isn't it?


How could we sue anybody?


Do you need some money, Frankie?


A few dollars to buy
some record albums?


Here. Take $5.


Or 10.


You promised you were going to quit.


Ma, I'm home.


(DOOR CREAKING)


Hey, hey!


You stay away from me. You hear me?


I don't know who you are,
but if you come back here...


Frank, calm down, will you?
I'm Dick Kesner.


I want you to leave your things here,
follow me into the next room.


Okay? They're all waiting for you.


PAULA: You don't have to be scared.
I'm right here, Frank.


I'll always be here.


But there are laws. Everything in
this country has to be legal.


So what we need to do
is make some decisions.


That's what Mr Kesner is here for.


Many times these decisions
are left up to the courts.


But that can be very expensive,
people fighting over their children.


Nobody is fighting.


Look at me, Frank. Nobody is fighting.


(SPEAKING IN FRENCH)


(WHISPERING)


Do you remember your grandma? Eve?
She arrived this morning.


- (GREETING IN FRENCH)
- Hello.


(SPEAKING IN FRENCH)


Do you understand
what we're saying to you, Frank?


Your father and I are getting a divorce.


(SPEAKING IN FRENCH)


Nothing's going to change.
We're still gonna see each other.


- Stop it, please. Don't interrupt.
- You don't have to read all of this.


Most of it is for your parents,
boring adult business.


But this paragraph right here,
this is important


because it states
who you're gonna live with


after the divorce.


Whose `custody` you will be in.


And there's a blank space right here.


(GRANDMOTHER
GRUMBLING IN FRENCH)


I want you to go into the kitchen,
sit at the table


and put a name down.


You can take as long as you want,


but when you come back into this room,


<i>I want to see a name on that line.</i>


(CHUCKLING) Frank, just write down
a name and this will all be over.


It's going to be okay.


FRANK: <i>Dad, what name?</i>


Your mother or your father.


Just put the name there.
It's as simple as that.


And don't look so scared. It's not a test.


<i>There's no wrong answer.</i>


(MAN CHATTERING ON PA)


(PANTING)


One ticket to Grand Central, please.


That will be $3.50, sir.


Is it okay if I write you a cheque?


Carl, when do I get to call my father?


CARL: You can call him when we get
to New York.


We leave for the airport in seven hours.


Until then, just sit there.


Be quiet.


On the other side of the hotel,
they got suites that face the park.


It's the best room the F.B.I. can afford.


It's okay, I've stayed in worse.


Please. You have to listen.


I don't want to hear your story.
Two cheques bounced.


You know how much trouble I'm in?


No, but listen. I'm telling you.
The bank, they made the mistake.


I'll write you another cheque right now!


What? Do I look like
I was born yesterday?


Look, it's midnight.
Where am I going to go?


You're a goddamn kid. Go home.


(BABY CRYING)


I hope you understand. My boss
sent me to Brooklyn, then Queens.


Now he wants me in Long Island


to take a few clients out
for a night on the town.


I'm sorry, but we're not allowed
to cash cheques from other banks.


- How would we know if they were good?
- What did you say your name was?


- Ashley.
- Ashley.


You know what I found
on the sidewalk out there?


Must have slipped right off your neck.


Is there something
I can help you with, son?


It's my grandmother's birthday
next week


and I want to get her something
extra special.


Please, it's my midterm next week
and my books were stolen.


(COUGHING)


Please, just $5.
No one would have to know.


I'm sorry,
but we are not allowed to take cheques


from people we don't know.


MAN: Welcome to New York.


(WOMEN GIGGLING)


Pleasure to have you back, Captain.


What do you think, Angelo?
The tomatoes are ripe this afternoon.


What have we here?


- Can I have your autograph?
- You betcha.


- Can I have your autograph, too?
- You gonna be a pilot?


Mmm-hmm.


There you go. Work hard in school.


FRANK: <i>Dear Dad,</i>


<i>I've decided to become an airline pilot.</i>


<i>I've applied to all the big airlines,</i>


<i>and I have several promising interviews
lined up.</i>


<i>How is Mom?
Have you called her lately?</i>


<i>Love, your son, Frank.</i>


Hello.


I'm Frank Black
from Murrow High School,


and I have an appointment
with Mr Morgan.


You're the young man who's writing
the article for the school paper.


Yes, ma'am. That's me.


I want to know everything there is
to know about being a pilot.


What airports does Pan Am fly to?
What does a pilot make in a year?


Who tells them where they're gonna
fly to?


- Slow down. Take them one at a time.
- All right.


What does it mean when
one pilot says to another pilot,


"What kind of equipment are you on?"


They want to know what aircraft
you're flying. DC-8, 707, Constellation...


And what about those I.D. badges
that I've seen pilots wear?


Every pilot must have two things
with him at all times.


One is his airline personnel badge,
looks just like this one from Pan Am.


The other one is their FAA licence.


And that looks just like this.


Oh...


Do you think I could make a copy
of this to put into my article?


Frank, you can have that one,
it's three years expired.


Thanks. And what about
your I.D. badge?


Do you have an extra one
I could borrow?


No, I can't help you there.


Those are special-ordered
from Polaroid.


The only way to get one
is to become a real live pilot


for Pan American Airways.


WOMAN ON PHONE:
<i>Pan Am, may I help you?</i>


FRANK: (IN SOUTHERN ACCENT)
Yeah. Hello, I'm calling about a uniform.


<i>- Hold for Purchasing.</i>
- Thank you.


WOMAN 2: <i>Purchasing.</i>


I'm a copilot based out of
San Francisco.


I flew a flight into New York last night,


but the problem is I'm headed out
to Paris in three hours.


<i>How can we help you?</i>


I sent my uniform to be cleaned
through the hotel


and I guess they must have lost it.


<i>They lost a uniform.
Happens all the time.</i>


<i>Go down to the Well-Built Uniform
Company at 9th and Broadway.</i>


<i>They're our uniform supplier.</i>


<i>I'll tell Mr Rosen you're coming.</i>


MAN: You look too young to be a pilot.


I'm a copilot.


Why so nervous?


How would you feel if you lost
your uniform first week on the job?


(LAUGHS) Relax.
Pan Am has got lots of uniforms.


It's gonna be $164.


Great. I'll write you a cheque.


Sorry, no checks, no cash.


You'll have to fill in
your employee I.D. number.


I'll bill Pan Am, and they'll take it out
of your next paycheck.


Even better.


FRANK: <i>Dear Dad,</i>


<i>you always told me
that an honest man has nothing to fear.</i>


<i>So I'm trying my best not to be afraid.</i>


<i>I'm sorry I ran away,
but you don't have to worry.</i>


<i>I'm gonna get it all back now, Daddy.
I promise. I'm gonna get it all back.</i>


Are you a real live pilot?


I sure am, little lady. What's your name?


- Celine.
- Celine, it's a pleasure to meet you.


It's a pleasure to meet you, too.


That's 50, 70, 80, 90,


$100.


You have yourself a great time in Paris.


I always do.


Excuse me.


I'm John Modiger. I manage this branch.


I want to thank you for coming in
and using our institution.


It's a pleasure to meet you, John.
I'll be back again.


Good.


Have you stayed with us before?


No, I've been primarily based
on the West Coast.


Is it all right if I write you a cheque
for the room?


- No problem, sir.
- Great.


I was also wondering
if I could write you a personal cheque?


For airline personnel,
we cash personal cheques up to $100.


Payroll cheques we cash up to 300.


Did you say 300 for a payroll cheque?


(TYPING)


FRANK: <i>Dear Dad,</i>


<i>I've decided to become a pilot
for Pan American Airways,</i>


<i>the most trusted name in the skies.</i>


<i>They've accepted me into their training
programme and told me if I work hard,</i>


<i>I should earn my wings real soon.</i>


<i>Please get in touch with Joanna Carlton
from the 10th grade.</i>


<i>Tell her I'm sorry that I could not
take her to the junior prom.</i>


<i>Love, your son, Frank.</i>


- Hello, how are you?
- Fine, thank you.


I have a payroll cheque I'd like to cash.


Certainly.


Excuse me.


I'm sure you hear this all the time,


but you have the most beautiful eyes
I have ever seen.


Yeah, I do get that all the time.
(CHUCKLES)


How would you like it?


I'm sorry, sir. We won't have any cash
until the banks open in an hour.


But I'm sure they can cash your cheque
at the airport.


The airport?


Who cashes cheques at the airport?


The airlines.
They've always taken care of their own.


(WOMAN CHATTERING ON PA)


- Hello.
- Hi. Are you deadheading?


What?


Are you my deadhead to Miami?


- Yes.

Yeah, I'm the deadhead. Here you go.


You're a little late,
but the jump seat is open.


It's been a while since I've done this.
Which one is the jump seat again?


(BOTH LAUGHING)


Have a nice flight.


Are you my deadhead?


Frank, Captain Oliver.
John Larkin, the copilot.


Fred Tulley, flight engineer.


Frank Taylor, Pan Am.
Thanks for giving me a lift, boys.


Go ahead and take a seat, Frank.
We're about to push.


What kind of equipment you on, DC-8?


707.


You turning around on the redeye?


I'm jumping puddles
for the next few months,


trying to earn my keep running
leap frogs for the weak and `weary`.


No shame in that. We all did it.


- Have a seat.
- Thank you.


Would you like a drink after takeoff?


Milk?


PILOT: Eighty knots.
CO-PILOT: Check.


PILOT: V-one. Rotate.


V-two. Positive rate.


COPILOT: Gear up.


FRANK: <i>Dear Dad,
today was graduation.</i>


<i>I am now a copilot,
earning $1,400 a month, plus benefits.</i>


<i>And the best part is,
they tell me my family can fly for free.</i>


<i>So tell Mom to pack her bags
and buy a new swimsuit</i>


<i>because I'm taking us all to Hawaii
for Christmas.</i>


<i>I love you, Dad</i>. Aloha, <i>Frank.</i>


- Hello, deadhead.
- Hello.


Enjoying your free ride?


Marci,


did you drop this?


- Must have slipped right off your neck.
- No.


No!


MARCI: Yes, yes, yes!


(MOANING)


(PANTING)


Why are you stopping?


I want to tell you something, Marci.


This is by far


the best date I have ever been on.


(GIGGLING)


Welcome to Miami Mutual Bank.
How may I help you?


My name is Frank Taylor.
I'm a copilot for Pan Am.


I'd like to cash this cheque and then


I'd like to take you out for a steak dinner.


(EXCLAIMS IN SURPRISE)


LUCY: Then we feed the cheques
into the MICR machine,


which uses special ink to encode


the account numbers
on the bottom of the checks.


And where are these numbers?


- They're right here.
- Right there?


They're called routing numbers.


So where do the cheques get routed to?


I don't exactly know.
Nobody ever asked me that before.


(BOTH LAUGHING)


Our next item up for bid is also from
the Jersey Central Bank foreclosure.


This is a MICR encoder,
a machine used to encode bank checks.


Do I have an opening bid?


CARL: <i>Our unknown subject
is a paperhanger</i>


<i>who started working on the East Coast.</i>


<i>In the last few weeks,
this unsub has developed</i>


<i>a new form of cheque fraud
I'm calling "The Float."</i>


What he's doing is he's opening
checking accounts at various banks,


then changing the MICR ink routing
numbers at the bottom of those checks.


Next slide, please. Next slide, please.


The remote thing is broken.
You'll have to do it by hand.


Agent Mullen, it should be
the square button by the side.


This carousel doesn't work.
It's a bad carousel.


- Thank you.
- Move it manually.


This is a map of the 12 banks
of the U.S. Federal Reserve.


Slide.


MICR scanners at every bank
read these numbers


at the bottom of the cheque. Slide.


And then ship that cheque off
to its corresponding branch.


Carl, for those of us
who are unfamiliar with bank fraud,


you mind telling us
what the hell you're talking about?


The East Coast branches
are numbered 01 to 06.


The central branch is 07, 08,
so on and so forth.


You mean those numbers at the bottom
of a cheque actually mean something?


All of this was in the report I filed
two days ago. If you change


a 02 to a 12, that means that cheque,


which was cashed in New York,


does not go
to the New York Federal Branch,


but it is re-routed all the way
to the San Francisco Federal Branch.


The bank doesn't even know
the cheque has bounced for two weeks.


Which means our unsub
can stay in one place,


paper the same city over and over again
while his cheques circle the country.


You want to talk to my wife.


She's the one who balances
the chequebook at our house.


(ALL LAUGHING)

Daddy.


My son, the birdman.
That's some uniform, Frank.


What do you think?


Nice.


Sit down.


Dad, have you gotten the postcards?


Of course.


This fork is ice-cold.


No, Dad, that's a chilled salad fork.


It's a fancy restaurant, you know.


Here.


- I got you something.
- What's that?


Open it.


You know what those are, right?


Those are the keys
to a 1965 Cadillac DeVille convertible.


Brand-new, Dad.
Red with white interior,


split seats, air conditioning, the works.


Are you giving me a Cadillac?


I'm giving you a Cadillac.


Dad, she's parked downstairs.


When we're done eating lunch, why
don't you drive on over to Mom's house,


pick her up, take a little joy ride?


Do you know what would happen


if the IRS found out I was driving around
in a new coupe?


I took the train here, Frank.
I'm taking the train home.


All right.


I have plenty of money.


You know, if you ever need anything.


You worried? About me?


No, I'm not worried.


You think I can't buy my own car?


Two mice fell in a bucket
of cream, Frank.


Which one am I?


You're that second mouse.


I went by the store today.


I had to close the store for a while.
It's all about timing, Frank.


Goddamn government knows that.
They hit you when you're down.


I wasn't going to let them take it
from me, so I just


shut the doors myself, called their bluff.


Sooner or later, they'll forget about me.


I understand.


Have you told Ma?


She's so stubborn, your mother.


Don't worry, I'm not going to let her go
without a fight.


I'm fighting for us...


Dad?


...since the day we met.


Daddy, out of all those men,


you were the one that took her home,
remember that?


Two hundred men


sitting in that tiny social hall,
watching her dance.


- What was the name of that town?
- Montrichard, Dad.


I didn't speak a word of French,


and six weeks later, she was my wife.


She is your wife.


My son bought me a Cadillac today.
I think that calls for a toast.


(CLEARS THROAT)


To the best damn pilot in the sky.


It's not what you think. I'm just a copilot.


You see these people staring at you?


These are the most powerful people
in New York City.


They keep peeking over their shoulders,
wondering where you're going tonight.


Where you going, Frank?


Dad, nobody's staring at me.


Some place exotic?


Just tell me where you're going.


Los... Hollywood.


Hollywood?


Come here.


(WHISPERS) The rest of us
really are suckers.


So I got on this red dress
and these high heels, right?


I got a bra out here.


I'm chasing two Puerto Rican guys
through the park.


They got a suitcase
filled with bank robbery loot.


Okay, I'm screaming out,
"F.B.I., freeze!"


I'm reaching for my gun,
but I can't find it in the bra.


It's so damn big,
I thought I was going to shoot my tits off.


(LAUGHING)


That's a funny story.
People always laugh at that story.


Let me ask you a question,
Mr Amdursky.


If you had so much fun undercover,
why did you transfer to bank fraud?


I didn't transfer.
I was `censured` and `reassigned`.


It's like being punished. I was punished.
I screwed up in the field.


What about you, Mr Fox, were you
punished for screwing up in the field?


No, I've never worked in the field before.


I audited background investigations


of Department of Justice
clerical applicants.


That's just great. I ask for a team
and they drag the bottom of the Pacific.


Mind if I ask you a question,
Agent Hanratty?


How come you're so serious
all the time?


Does it bother you, Mr Amdursky?


Yeah, it does bother me.


Does it bother you, Mr Fox?


A little, I guess.


Would you like to hear me tell a joke?


Yeah, we'd love to hear a joke from you.


Knock, knock.


Who's there?


Go fuck yourselves.

He's dabbling in government checks.


We've been following a paper trail
on this guy for months now.


You mind taking that gun
out of my face?


Please. Really. It makes me nervous.


Let me see some credentials.


Yeah, sure.


Take my whole wallet.


You want my gun, too?
Come over here, take my gun.


Hey. Hey, look.


Just do me a favour, take a look outside.
Look out the window.


My partner's walking him to the car

He jumped right through the window

You never can be
too careful these days.


Well, tough luck, Carl.


Five minutes earlier, you would've
landed yourself a pretty good collar.


Is that right? Ten seconds later,
you'd have been shot.


Mind if I come downstairs with you?
I got to take a look at this guy.


Sure thing. Just do me a favour

It was stupid. I made a stupid mistake.


Forget about it.


There are hundreds
of unknown subjects out there.


I can get this guy. The worst thing
a paperhanger can do is show his face.


I read the report.


Six feet tall, brown hair,
27 to 30 years of age, 160 pounds.


This could be almost anybody.


I heard his voice. I saw his face.


There's nothing for him
to hide behind any more.


Just be careful.


You got 12 years in.


Nobody bothers you down
on the first floor.


You practically wrote
the book on bank fraud.


That's the kind of thing that can
make you section chief someday.


Just don't put yourself
in this type of position.


What type of position?


The position of being humiliated.


Sean, would you like to hear me
tell a joke?


Yeah. Sure.


Knock, knock.


FRANK: My next question is,
when a pilot retires,


Pan Am sends them a cheque
every single month?


Yeah, `pension` programme
sends a cheque and benefits.


How much is that cheque for?


Kid, I'm really not in the mood
for this right now.


This Skywayman's driving me crazy.


Who's the Skywayman?


Some nut flying around the country,
posing as a Pan Am pilot.


There's a column about him
in the paper today.


I keep telling them it's not my problem.
This guy doesn't even fly Pan Am.


Flies everybody else.
Flies United, TWA,

how much would you pay?

I'm going downstairs to cash a cheque.


You think this hotel is going to cash
a $1,000 cheque at 3:00 a.m.?


It's a New York Savings and Loan
cheque. It's like gold. They'll cash it.


Don't you think they might get
a little suspicious? Let me see that.


It's a cashier's cheque.
Endorse it over to me.


I couldn't do that.

I'm really sorry if I made a fool

Hello, Brenda.


Hi, Dr Conners.


- You need to sign these.
- Thank you.


Do you notice anything different
about me?


You got your braces off! Come here.


I've been trying to show you all night!


Wow.


Good job.


Did it hurt when they took them off?
Mine felt so weird after.


I keep rubbing my tongue over them.
I can't stop!


They're so slippery.


- It feels good, doesn't it?
- Yeah, it feels incredible.


Oh, my!


I'm sorry.

Do you really think I have to go?


In here, Dr Conners.

Gentlemen, what seems
to be the problem?


Bicycle accident. A fractured tibia
about five inches below the patella.


Hmm.


Dr Harris.


Do you concur?


Concur with what, sir?


With what Dr Ashland just said.
Do you concur?


Well, it was a bicycle accident.
The boy told us.


So you concur?


We should take an X-ray, `stitch` him up
and put him in a walking cast.


Very good, Dr Ashland. Very good.


Well, you don't seem
to have much need for me.


Carry on.

Why didn't I concur?

FRANK, SR.: Make yourself at home!


Frank Abagnale, Sr.


You're not a cop.


Special Agent Hanratty, F.B.I.


You're not a cop.
My landlord said you were not a cop.


If you're going to arrest me,
I'd like to put on a different suit.


- If that's okay...
- I'm not here to arrest you.


I'm looking for your son. He's in trouble.


Do you know where he is?


If I tell you where he is,
will you promise not to tell his mother?


Sure.


Frank made up a fake I.D.
and `enlisted` in the Marine Corps.


He's over in Vietnam right now.


That kid is halfway around the world,


crawling through the damn jungle,
fighting the communists, so...


Please, don't come to my home
and call my boy a criminal...


I never said he was a criminal,
Mr Abagnale. I said he was in trouble.


If you'd like to give me a call and talk,
here's my number.


You're not a father, are you?


Pardon me?


If you were a father, you'd know.


I would never give up my son.
I would never give up my son.

You don't have to cry.


I'm sorry! I'm so sorry, Frank!
I can't do this.


Brenda, listen to me.


I don't care if you're a virgin, all right?


Really, I can wait.


I'm not a virgin.


I had an abortion two years ago.


My parents had a friend do it.


A man that my father plays golf with.


And when I got better,
they kicked me out of the house.


(SOBBING) I had an abortion
and I wasn't their daughter any more!


I'm so sorry. Please don't be mad at me.


No, no.


- Please don't be mad at me.
- Shh.


What if I spoke to your parents?


Maybe I can straighten things out.


I ask them all the time,
but they said I still can't come home.


And my daddy's a lawyer.


Brenda?


What if you were engaged to a doctor?


Would that change anything?


What?


What if I went to your parents,


and I spoke to your father


and I asked permission to marry you?


- It's empty.
- Nobody here.


(SIGHS)


Dr Conners, are you Lutheran?


Yes, I am a Lutheran.


But please, call me Frank.


Frank, would you like to say grace?


Unless you're not comfortable.


Absolutely.


(CLEARS THROAT)


Two little mice fell
into a bucket of cream.


The first mouse
quickly gave up and drowned,


but the second mouse struggled so hard


that he eventually churned
that cream into butter,


and he walked out.


Amen.


That was beautiful.


The mouse churned
that cream into butter.


That's right.


Thank you.


Frank, have you decided which hospital
you want to work at in New Orleans?


To be quite honest,
I'm thinking about getting back into law.


Oh, my! Are you a doctor or a lawyer?


Before I went to medical school,
I passed the bar in California.


I practised law for one year,
then I decided,


why not try my hand at paediatrics?
(LAUGHS)


You're just full of surprises.


Yeah.


A doctor and a lawyer.
Brenda hit the jackpot.


Where did you go to law school?


Berkeley.


(BOTH GASPING)


Oh, my gosh.
Isn't that where you went, Daddy?


Maybe Frank could come
work for you, Roger.


You're always saying how hard it is
to find assistant prosecutors.


Could he, Daddy? Could he, please?
Could he come work with you, please?


Was that snake Hollingsworth


still teaching there
when you went through Berkeley?


Hollingsworth.


Yes. `Grumpy` old Hollingsworth, right?


Meaner than ever.


And that dog of his?


Tell me, Frank,
what was the name of his little dog?


I'm sorry.


The dog was dead.


WOMEN: Oh.


How unfortunate.


Yeah.


A doctor, a lawyer, a Lutheran.


So, what are you, Frank?


'Cause I think you're about to ask
for my daughter's hand in marriage,


and I have a right to know.


Know what, sir?


The truth.


Tell me the truth, Frank.


What are you doing here?


What is a man like you
doing with Brenda?


If you want my blessing,
if you want my daughter,


I'd like to hear it from you now.


The truth is, sir...


The truth is that...


I'm not a doctor, I'm not a lawyer.


I'm not an airline pilot.


I'm nothing, really.


I'm just a kid
who's in love with your daughter.


No.


You know what you are?


You're a romantic.


Men like us are nothing
without the women we love.


I must confess,
I'm guilty of the same foolish whimsy.


I proposed to Carol after five dates


with two nickels in my pockets
and holes in my shoes


because I knew she was the one.


So go ahead, Frank.


Don't be afraid.


Ask the question you came here
to ask me.


What would I have to do to take the bar
here in New Orleans?


(LAUGHING)


No, the other question.


WOMAN: Right through that door.


Good luck, Mr Conners.


Thank you.


Hey, Frank.


You know what I could never figure out?


How did you cheat on the bar exam
in Louisiana?


What's the difference?


- Someone took the test for you?
- I'm going to prison for a long time.


Seriously, what's the difference?


It's a simple question.


Are you going to eat that éclair?


Yeah. I'm saving it for later.


Or you want to split it with me?


No.


Give me half that éclair and I'll tell you.


I'm gonna figure it out sooner or later.


You'll be working under Phillip Rigby
in corporate law.


Why don't you settle in,
organise your desk?


We're having lunch at 12:30


with the Attorney General
and Governor McKeithen himself.


A governor!


Did we spell it right?


You sure did.


Congratulations.


- Thank you, sir.
- Welcome aboard.

All the jewellery, the furs, everything

Yeah, she came to pick up some boxes.


That's okay. You know why?

Eventually, he's gotta go back

I think that's why he's moving back

He's making a circle.


He's running out of checks.


It's a long shot, but if we could track him

in Chicago, I don't get to see her much.


What's in the briefcase?


I'm on my way to the airport.


It's a paperhanger
working his way through Minnesota.


(CHUCKLING)


Jesus. He's driving us crazy.


You got any of the checks?


Yeah, I got a counterfeit he drew


in Great Lakes Savings and Loan.


He's using a stencil machine
and an Underwood.


It's a teller at the bank.


Say again?


It's definitely a teller, Carl.


Banks always use hand stamps
for the dates.


They get used over and over again,
so they always get worn out.


And the numbers are always cracking.
The sixes and the nines,


see, they go first.


Thanks.


(DOOR BUZZING)


MARSH: I'd like you to take a look
at something for me.


Tell me what you think.


That's a fake.


How do you know,
you haven't looked at it?


There's no perforated edge, right?


I mean, this cheque was hand-cut,
not fed.


Yeah.


Paper is double-bonded,
much too heavy to be a bank cheque.


Magnetic ink, it's raised against
my fingers instead of flat.


(SNIFFING)


And this doesn't smell like MICR,
it's some kind of a drafting ink.


The kind you get at a stationery store.


Frank,


would you be interested in working
with the F.B.I.'s Financial Crimes Unit?


I already got a job here, you know.
I deliver the mail.


Frank, we have the power
to take you out of prison.


You'll be placed in the custody
of the F.B.I. where you'd serve out


the remainder of your sentence


as an employee
of the Federal Government.


Under whose custody?


Hi.


I'm Frank Abagnale.
I'm supposed to start work here today.


It's a tour company
operating out of the BVI.


Sir, Mr Abagnale is here.


I'm gonna call you back.


- Hello, Carl.
- Welcome to the F.B.I.


I'll show you where you're working.


How long do I have to work here?


It's 8:15 in the morning
to 5:00 in the afternoon,


45 minutes for lunch.


No. I mean, how long?


Every day.


Every day, Frank, till we let you go.


Hey, Carl.


How are you doing?


It's not a good time, Frank.
I'm clearing my desk for the weekend.


You mind
if I come to work with you tomorrow?


Tomorrow is Saturday.


I'm flying to Chicago
to see my daughter.


I'll be back to work on Monday.


- You're going to see Grace?
- Yeah, that's the plan.


What should I do till Monday?


I'm sorry, kid, I can't help you there.
Excuse me.


(PHONE RINGING)


This is Hanratty.


Yeah, put him on.


Mr Sawyer.


How are you?


I have half a dozen more cheques
on that tour operator at the BVI.


(WOMAN CHATTERING ON PA)


How did you do it, Frank?


How did you pass the bar in Louisiana?


What are you doing here?


Listen.


I'm sorry I put you through all this.


You go back to Europe,
you'll die in Perpignan Prison.


You try to run here in the States,


we'll send you back to Atlanta
for 50 years.


I know that.


I spent four years
trying to arrange your release.


I had to convince my bosses
at the F.B.I.


and the Attorney General
of the United States you wouldn't run.


Why did you do it?


- You're just a kid.
- I'm not your kid.


You said you were going to Chicago.


My daughter can't see me this weekend.
She's going skiing.


You said she was four years old.
You're lying.


She was four when I left. Now she's 15.


My wife has been remarried
for 11 years.


I see Grace every now and again.


- I don't understand.
- Sure you do.


Sometimes it's easier living the lie.


I'm gonna let you fly tonight, Frank.


I won't even try to stop you, because
I know you'll be back on Monday.


Yeah.


- How do you know I'll come back?
- (CHUCKLES)


Look.


Frank.


Nobody is chasing you.


Alice, has he still not called?


No, he hasn't.


CARL: <i>Good morning.</i>


I've called this meeting to discuss


a new type of cheque fraud
and counterfeiting.


The unsub is washing
and altering checks,


then passing them throughout Arizona.


This unsub is a big dog,
passing cheques as large as five figures.


(DOOR OPENING)


Sorry I'm late.


Sorry.


We have a recovered cheque
on Agent Reiter's desk.


Why don't we step out to the bullpen?


There's impressions on every line.


Looks like the original amount
was for $60.


Mind if I take a look?


Cashed in Flagstaff a week ago.


Cost the bank $16,000.


- It's a real cheque.
- Yeah.


It's been washed.
The only thing original is the signature.


But it's perfect.


I mean, this isn't hydrochloride
or `bleach`.


No.


Something new.


A nail polish remover where the acetone
removes the ink that's not been printed?


How did you do it, Frank?


How did you cheat on the bar exam
in Louisiana?


I didn't cheat.


I studied for two weeks and I passed.


Is that the truth?


Is that the truth?


I'll bet this guy steals cheques
out of mailboxes.


He washes off their names
and puts on his own.


You're saying he's a local?


If it were me, I'd call the bank first.
Check out the balance...


Make sure there's enough money
in there to make it worth your while.


Exactly.


You know, Carl, I think
this guy is pretty smart.


Guess all we have to do now
is catch him.
