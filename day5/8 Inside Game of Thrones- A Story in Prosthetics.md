GOWER: The process of `prosthetics` is something I don't think people are quite aware of how extensive it is. It's such a complex department, and the build that goes into these things is quite time consuming. From seeing our actor come to our studio and we take a head cast of him... to sticking the makeup on on set is, um, you know, it's quite a long build time. But I think what's great for us is that it's lovely to see all our hard work and all these things we've built actually make it to the screen as well, at the end of the day. (GROUND CRACKLES) (SLATE CLAPS) 

MAN: Okay. And we cut. 

GOWER: Just an average prosthetic makeup, we usually say, is about 4 to 6 weeks to build. We have so many patient actors that sit in our chair for like four or six or eight hours at a time. So, by the time we usually step on set to do a rehearsal, we've already pretty much done a full day's work. So to then film and have our fun on set making sure everything's not falling off people for 12 hours. The de-wig in the evening can take a good, um, an hour, you know, or two hours. People are quite unaware of the length of time and the process that goes into these things. -(GRUNTS) -(SOLDIERS YELLING) 

GOWER: So, each year, it's got bigger and bigger and bigger... (MAG YELLS) ...to the point now with season eight, where we're sort of maxing numbers about the 70 or 80 mark on set. And in the workshop, we usually have a team of about 50 people. It's a big department to manage. I think we are very fortunate to have accumulated a really talented pool of prosthetic people. I got hired season four. We only had six wights filming, and these were these green screen guys, and at the time, that was a huge thing for us at the time. Cut to Hardhome the following year, where it just exploded. -(WOOD CRACKLES) -(WIGHTS SHRIEK) We had something like about forty to 50 prosthetic guys out there at any one time playing the wights and White Walkers. ♪ (DRAMATIC MUSIC BUILDS) ♪ (DISTANT SHRIEKING) 

When we found out two years ago there's only 13 episodes left... (SHRIEKING) ...I think we were obviously `gutted` and `distraught`. But I think it's a real testament to the guys that they stuck to their word and they're basically finishing the `franchise` when it should naturally end. It's become such a huge part of our life now, I think finishing next year and moving on to other projects is really `daunting`. I think it's probably scary for a lot of folk because we've just become part of this incredible family. The end is nigh, but I think it's gonna be a big end.
