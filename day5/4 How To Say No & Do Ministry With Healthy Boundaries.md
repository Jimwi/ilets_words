#AskThrive - Episode 17 - How To Say No & Do Ministry With Healthy Boundaries

WEBVTT Kind: captions Language: en 

Hi, my name is Zach and I'm from Millcreek, Washington. My question is, "In `ministry`, you get pulled in a lot of different ways. And my question is how do you say no?" 

Man, `in ministry`, you do get pulled in a lot of different ways. I personally believe there is one demon assigned to `distraction`. He's just trying, he's that guy that pokes babies at the end of `sermons` right when you're giving the altar call - it's just a constant part of leadership. And here's the only way that I've figured on how to say no and not get `distracted`. I have to know my priorities. I really have to have them `rehearsed`. A long time ago a business leader said to me, he said to me, there's two types of people, Curt. There are those types of people that make a things to do list. Are you a list maker? Do you write everything you need to down? If you do, good! You're half way there. Then he went on to say, there's another group of people and they are way more effective. After they write out their things to do list, they prioritize it. They figure out what should be done first. Have you ever used a critical path? A critical path is not just what needs to be done, it's what needs to be done and in the order that it needs to be done. When you know your priorities and you put them in a critical path, what needs to be done first, it makes it far easier to say no. 

And it also makes it easier to explain to people why you have to say no to them. You're not just saying, "hey, I'm rejecting you - I don't have time for you - I'm too important for you." You can tell them, "listen, I have to get this priority done so I can't accept the opportunity that you are offering me." When you tell them that, it's a lot more `palatable`. So what's your list? How have you prioritized it? What do you need to get done first? When you know that you're going to find it a lot easier to stay on track. 

You know in my office I have a little `chalk` board - it's just this big - and every quarter I `erase` it and I write out my top three priorities. I do it mostly as a reminder to me, but every single meeting I hold in my office, people can see that little chalk board and they go, you know what? this is what Curt is organizing his time around. It really helps people self-edit. And the other thing it does is this - it tells everyone that I'm going to stick to what God has called me to do in that season. That's the secret. 

Not saying no just to be mean, but saying no because you know your own priorities.
