ETC fos 4 Panel

WEBVTT Kind: captions Language: en 

Wendy: There is so much that can happen in post-production... maybe it doesn't have to if you could just have a more beautiful picture right from the beginning. 

Jim: ETC is not new to the studio and film market. We've been making products for that industry for over four decades, whether it's lights, or consoles, networking, `dimming`, But what we wanted to do with the ƒos/4 line was make products that were designed specifically with that industry in mind. We knew that we could make a fixture that would not have to sacrifice brightness for quality or `the other way around`. And so we've developed a series of panel lights that are truly tools for professionals. 

Wendy: We started with the question "What is the best light for camera?" ARG stands for the Advance Research Group. Arg was formed in 2016. It was Fred's idea. He specifically wanted a group that was focused on research. He has always been `passionate` about the quality of light. 

Gary: We try to identify problems that people are having and then we go back into our offices and we think, "how can we solve this problem?" 

Bill: We can pick solutions that are not necessary economical just to see if it can be done, then at some point maybe in the future it becomes economical, then we can implement it. 

Wendy: With the industry move to LED technology, one of the things that has been sacrificed up until now has been these long wavelength Reds. The Red that we have today looks red because all color is relative, and it was next to things that were more Orange, shorter wavelengths. but we've still actually been missing all of these beautiful long wavelengths that we had with tungsten until now. and now we have this Deep Red. So the red we've been using and that the industry uses the sort of standard red is around 635 nanometers. this new red is around 660 nanometers and 25 doesn't maybe seem like very many... but it's huge. 

Gary: ARG had prototyped a set of `fixtures` using the Deep Red because we thought that it might be useful. and Fred and Wendy and a video camera got together and they noticed that if you illuminate a subject with Deep Red the appearance on the video display was so dramatic that Fred said we have to have this in our next fixtures. 

Jim: the great thing about the ƒos/4 panels is that they don't make you choose between brightness and quality. We spent a long time developing these products because we wanted to have a fixture that would give you both. So what we've ended up with here is an incredibly bright fixture that also has just the highest quality of light output that you can get. All this comes together in our x8 color engine. The Lustr array brings new depth to color mixing capabilities with a greater color `gamut`, not only rich and saturated when you need that, but also just clean and crisp when that's what you're looking for. 

David: So in this product we have a Lustr, and a Daylight array. The Lustr array: it's focused on saturated colors and warm white applications and we have the Daylight HDR option which is focused on `tunable` white light and specifically neutral white to cool white. 

Jim: My favorite thing about the new panel lights is the user interface. We have a brand new user interface that was designed specifically for this product line, that includes backlit encoders that are color changing, so they correspond to whatever you're manipulating on the screen itself 

David: I'm excited by some of the features that make this fixture easy to use things like the color picker, things like the tuning parameter that let the user select the output from: brightes, best spectral, or a hybrid combination of the two. 

Jon: This being so interacted, constantly re-aimed by hand, pulled out of a truck... we needed to make sure that this was a `tactile` product 

Zack: Jon and I were using 3D printing and different types of rapid prototyping to address problems that we saw but also just show other engineers, people in marketing, what they're headed towards. 

Jon: In exploring those handles we are actually able to solve a lot of other problems at the same time such as addressing fixture stability. We looked at including an `extrusion` rail in the back that we can mount any type of accessory to. 

Zack: The utility in the Griprail is the fact that it kind of pairs well with all the different little devices and all the little `gadgets` we have now. And there's things like additional batteries, or putting tablets on, even just the ability to `loop up a cord` or a cable and actually put it on the back of your fixture really comes in handy. 

Jim: We also have a lot of unique things as a company to offer to the studio and television industry. All of our fixtures are covered by a 5-year fixture `warranty` and a 10 year `warranty` on the LED array itself. We also have industry-leading support; we have technicians available 24/7, 365. We started this process by asking "What's next?" and "How can we help advance the artistry of lighting for camera?" We've carried this question with us throughout the development process. The ƒos/4 family is the `culmination` of that work, as it delivers a panel light that is uncompromising in brightness and color quality.
