`Chancellor` Carol Christ - Back to School 2018

Throughout the years I've spent on college campuses, as a student, a member of the faculty, and an administrator, nothing `surpasses` the excitement and energy that `usher` in the start of the fall semester. Now, as the controlled chaos of move-in `subsides`, and we catch our collective breath before classes begin, I want to take a moment to greet the returning members of our community, and most importantly, offer the warmest of welcomes to Berkeley's new students. I get a `vicarious` thrill just thinking about all that awaits those of you for whom our university is new and unexplored territory. We look forward to getting to know you and wish you nothing but the very best on the road ahead. I hope you will come to `cherish` your membership in this extraordinary community, just as I have. While this annual `ritual` plays out on every college campus, nowhere in my experience is the `renewed` sense of promise and purpose more `tangible` and true than here. And that, I believe, comes from two key attributes of Berkeley's DNA: First, there is our `disdain` for the status quo - for the notion that good enough is good enough; for the idea that what exists today can't be improved tomorrow. Join to that is our deep engagement with the world around us and the shared `commitment` we have to making it a better, more `equitable` place for all. These are the personality `traits` that help make Berkeley a university, uniquely `animated` by, and primed to take on, the `salient` challenges and opportunities of our day. Next week, in a message to campus, I will share a more detailed description of our priorities for the year ahead and the significant progress we've made in addressing the university's financial challenges. But, for now, I want to tell you how much we look forward to engaging the community in a campus-wide conversation about the many `initiatives` and investments that I believe will `usher` in a new era of diversity, discovery, and excellence for our university. It's a wonderful time of year; a wonderful time to be at Berkeley. And to that, I can only add... `Go Bears`!
