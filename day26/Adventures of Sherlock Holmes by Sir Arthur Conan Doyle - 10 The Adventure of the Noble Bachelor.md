Adventure Ten of The Adventures of Sherlock
Holmes

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:08.519
This Librivox recording is in the public domain

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:13.769
and is read by Mark Smith of Simpsonville,
South Carolina

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:18.340
The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes, by Sir
Arthur Conan Doyle

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:25.440
Adventure Ten THE ADVENTURE OF THE NOBLE BACHELOR

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:29.600
The Lord St. Simon marriage, and its curious
termination, have

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:33.410
long ceased to be a subject of interest in
those exalted circles

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:35.640
in which the unfortunate bridegroom moves.

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:38.309
Fresh scandals have
eclipsed it, and their more piquant details

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:42.390
have drawn the
gossips away from this four-year-old drama.

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:45.690
As I have reason to
believe, however, that the full facts have

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:49.719
never been revealed to
the general public, and as my friend Sherlock

00:00:49.719 --> 00:00:52.700
Holmes had a
considerable share in clearing the matter

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:56.820
up, I feel that no
memoir of him would be complete without some

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:00.539
little sketch of
this remarkable episode.

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:04.050
It was a few weeks before my own marriage,
during the days when I

00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:07.750
was still sharing rooms with Holmes in Baker
Street, that he came

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:11.040
home from an afternoon stroll to find a letter
on the table

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:12.659
waiting for him.

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:18.409
I had remained indoors all day, for the weather
had taken a sudden turn to rain, with high

00:01:18.409 --> 00:01:22.430
autumnal winds, and
the Jezail bullet which I had brought back

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:27.310
in one of my limbs as
a relic of my Afghan campaign throbbed with

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:29.290
dull persistence.

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:33.460
With my body in one easy-chair and my legs
upon another, I had

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:37.700
surrounded myself with a cloud of newspapers
until at last,

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:41.600
saturated with the news of the day, I tossed
them all aside and

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:45.299
lay listless, watching the huge crest and
monogram upon the

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:49.470
envelope upon the table and wondering lazily
who my friend's

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:51.899
noble correspondent could be.

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:57.229
"Here is a very fashionable epistle," I remarked
as he entered.

00:01:57.229 --> 00:02:00.201
"Your morning letters, if I remember right,
were from a

00:02:00.201 --> 00:02:02.119
fish-monger and a tide-waiter."

00:02:02.119 --> 00:02:06.450
"Yes, my correspondence has certainly the
charm of variety," he

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:10.710
answered, smiling, "and the humbler are usually
the more

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:12.409
interesting.

00:02:12.409 --> 00:02:17.140
This looks like one of those unwelcome social
summonses which call upon a man either to

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:19.720
be bored or to lie."

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:22.830
He broke the seal and glanced over the contents.

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:28.220
"Oh, come, it may prove to be something of
interest, after all."

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:30.409
"Not social, then?"

00:02:30.409 --> 00:02:32.310
"No, distinctly professional."

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:35.319
"And from a noble client?"

00:02:35.319 --> 00:02:37.790
"One of the highest in England."

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:41.370
"My dear fellow, I congratulate you."

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:45.630
"I assure you, Watson, without affectation,
that the status of my

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:51.209
client is a matter of less moment to me than
the interest of his

00:02:51.209 --> 00:02:52.209
case.

00:02:52.209 --> 00:02:54.010
It is just possible, however, that that also
may not be

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:56.970
wanting in this new investigation.

00:02:56.970 --> 00:03:00.689
You have been reading the
papers diligently of late, have you not?"

00:03:00.689 --> 00:03:05.270
"It looks like it," said I ruefully, pointing
to a huge bundle in

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:06.270
the corner.

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:08.599
"I have had nothing else to do."

00:03:08.599 --> 00:03:13.349
"It is fortunate, for you will perhaps be
able to post me up.

00:03:13.349 --> 00:03:15.860
I
read nothing except the criminal news and

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:17.320
the agony column.

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:20.330
The
latter is always instructive.

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:23.920
But if you have followed recent
events so closely you must have read about

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:26.260
Lord St. Simon and his
wedding?"

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:29.409
"Oh, yes, with the deepest interest."

00:03:29.409 --> 00:03:31.370
"That is well.

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:34.100
The letter which I hold in my hand is from
Lord

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:35.350
St. Simon.

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:38.040
I will read it to you, and in return you must
turn

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:42.720
over these papers and let me have whatever
bears upon the matter.

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:44.790
This is what he says:

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:46.360
"'MY DEAR MR.

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:49.629
SHERLOCK HOLMES:--Lord Backwater tells me
that I

00:03:49.629 --> 00:03:54.140
may place implicit reliance upon your judgment
and discretion.

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:56.769
I
have determined, therefore, to call upon you

00:03:56.769 --> 00:04:00.469
and to consult you
in reference to the very painful event which

00:04:00.469 --> 00:04:04.319
has occurred in
connection with my wedding.

00:04:04.319 --> 00:04:09.870
Mr. Lestrade, of Scotland Yard, is
acting already in the matter, but he assures

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:14.099
me that he sees no
objection to your co-operation, and that he

00:04:14.099 --> 00:04:17.590
even thinks that
it might be of some assistance.

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:21.400
I will call at four o'clock in
the afternoon, and, should you have any other

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:26.020
engagement at that
time, I hope that you will postpone it, as

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:29.250
this matter is of
paramount importance.

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:31.169
Yours faithfully, ST.

00:04:31.169 --> 00:04:32.169
SIMON.'

00:04:32.169 --> 00:04:36.990
"It is dated from Grosvenor Mansions, written
with a quill pen,

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:40.370
and the noble lord has had the misfortune
to get a smear of ink

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:44.400
upon the outer side of his right little finger,"
remarked Holmes

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:46.580
as he folded up the epistle.

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:49.199
"He says four o'clock.

00:04:49.199 --> 00:04:51.020
It is three now.

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:53.050
He will be here in an
hour."

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:57.380
"Then I have just time, with your assistance,
to get clear upon

00:04:57.380 --> 00:04:58.669
the subject.

00:04:58.669 --> 00:05:01.040
Turn over those papers and arrange the extracts
in

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:05.229
their order of time, while I take a glance
as to who our client

00:05:05.229 --> 00:05:06.590
is."

00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:09.280
He picked a red-covered volume from a line
of books of

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:11.220
reference beside the mantelpiece.

00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:17.160
"Here he is," said he, sitting
down and flattening it out upon his knee.

00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:22.400
"'Lord Robert Walsingham
de Vere St. Simon, second son of the Duke

00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:24.180
of Balmoral.'

00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:25.190
Hum!

00:05:25.190 --> 00:05:29.780
'Arms:
Azure, three caltrops in chief over a fess

00:05:29.780 --> 00:05:30.780
sable.

00:05:30.780 --> 00:05:33.509
Born in 1846.'

00:05:33.509 --> 00:05:37.810
He's forty-one years of age, which is mature
for marriage.

00:05:37.810 --> 00:05:41.190
Was
Under-Secretary for the colonies in a late

00:05:41.190 --> 00:05:42.190
administration.

00:05:42.190 --> 00:05:45.220
The
Duke, his father, was at one time Secretary

00:05:45.220 --> 00:05:46.880
for Foreign Affairs.

00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:51.979
They inherit Plantagenet blood by direct descent,
and Tudor on

00:05:51.979 --> 00:05:53.760
the distaff side.

00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:54.760
Ha!

00:05:54.760 --> 00:05:58.220
Well, there is nothing very instructive in
all this.

00:05:58.220 --> 00:06:01.050
I think that I must turn to you Watson, for
something

00:06:01.050 --> 00:06:02.160
more solid."

00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:07.670
"I have very little difficulty in finding
what I want," said I,

00:06:07.670 --> 00:06:11.590
"for the facts are quite recent, and the matter
struck me as

00:06:11.590 --> 00:06:12.590
remarkable.

00:06:12.590 --> 00:06:15.310
I feared to refer them to you, however, as
I knew

00:06:15.310 --> 00:06:18.389
that you had an inquiry on hand and that you
disliked the

00:06:18.389 --> 00:06:20.720
intrusion of other matters."

00:06:20.720 --> 00:06:23.970
"Oh, you mean the little problem of the Grosvenor
Square

00:06:23.970 --> 00:06:25.690
furniture van.

00:06:25.690 --> 00:06:28.600
That is quite cleared up now--though, indeed,
it

00:06:28.600 --> 00:06:30.810
was obvious from the first.

00:06:30.810 --> 00:06:33.580
Pray give me the results of your
newspaper selections."

00:06:33.580 --> 00:06:37.520
"Here is the first notice which I can find.

00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:40.721
It is in the personal
column of the Morning Post, and dates, as

00:06:40.721 --> 00:06:45.919
you see, some weeks
back: 'A marriage has been arranged,' it says,

00:06:45.919 --> 00:06:50.069
'and will, if
rumour is correct, very shortly take place,

00:06:50.069 --> 00:06:55.050
between Lord Robert
St. Simon, second son of the Duke of Balmoral,

00:06:55.050 --> 00:06:59.379
and Miss Hatty
Doran, the only daughter of Aloysius Doran.

00:06:59.379 --> 00:07:03.910
Esq., of San
Francisco, Cal., U.S.A.'

00:07:03.910 --> 00:07:05.319
That is all."

00:07:05.319 --> 00:07:09.729
"Terse and to the point," remarked Holmes,
stretching his long,

00:07:09.729 --> 00:07:11.919
thin legs towards the fire.

00:07:11.919 --> 00:07:16.090
"There was a paragraph amplifying this in
one of the society

00:07:16.090 --> 00:07:18.220
papers of the same week.

00:07:18.220 --> 00:07:24.060
Ah, here it is: 'There will soon be a
call for protection in the marriage market,

00:07:24.060 --> 00:07:27.169
for the present
free-trade principle appears to tell heavily

00:07:27.169 --> 00:07:29.479
against our home
product.

00:07:29.479 --> 00:07:32.150
One by one the management of the noble houses
of Great

00:07:32.150 --> 00:07:36.120
Britain is passing into the hands of our fair
cousins from across

00:07:36.120 --> 00:07:37.850
the Atlantic.

00:07:37.850 --> 00:07:40.330
An important addition has been made during
the last

00:07:40.330 --> 00:07:44.419
week to the list of the prizes which have
been borne away by

00:07:44.419 --> 00:07:45.920
these charming invaders.

00:07:45.920 --> 00:07:51.889
Lord St. Simon, who has shown himself
for over twenty years proof against the little

00:07:51.889 --> 00:07:56.319
god's arrows, has
now definitely announced his approaching marriage

00:07:56.319 --> 00:08:00.470
with Miss Hatty
Doran, the fascinating daughter of a California

00:08:00.470 --> 00:08:01.470
millionaire.

00:08:01.470 --> 00:08:04.629
Miss
Doran, whose graceful figure and striking

00:08:04.629 --> 00:08:09.280
face attracted much
attention at the Westbury House festivities,

00:08:09.280 --> 00:08:12.630
is an only child,
and it is currently reported that her dowry

00:08:12.630 --> 00:08:16.819
will run to
considerably over the six figures, with expectancies

00:08:16.819 --> 00:08:18.720
for the
future.

00:08:18.720 --> 00:08:21.789
As it is an open secret that the Duke of Balmoral
has

00:08:21.789 --> 00:08:25.800
been compelled to sell his pictures within
the last few years,

00:08:25.800 --> 00:08:29.789
and as Lord St. Simon has no property of his
own save the small

00:08:29.789 --> 00:08:34.040
estate of Birchmoor, it is obvious that the
Californian heiress

00:08:34.040 --> 00:08:37.580
is not the only gainer by an alliance which
will enable her to

00:08:37.580 --> 00:08:42.080
make the easy and common transition from a
Republican lady to a

00:08:42.080 --> 00:08:43.130
British peeress.'"

00:08:43.130 --> 00:08:48.050
"Anything else?" asked Holmes, yawning.

00:08:48.050 --> 00:08:50.270
"Oh, yes; plenty.

00:08:50.270 --> 00:08:53.030
Then there is another note in the Morning
Post

00:08:53.030 --> 00:08:57.290
to say that the marriage would be an absolutely
quiet one, that it

00:08:57.290 --> 00:09:01.870
would be at St. George's, Hanover Square,
that only half a dozen

00:09:01.870 --> 00:09:05.050
intimate friends would be invited, and that
the party would

00:09:05.050 --> 00:09:08.500
return to the furnished house at Lancaster
Gate which has been

00:09:08.500 --> 00:09:11.760
taken by Mr. Aloysius Doran.

00:09:11.760 --> 00:09:16.400
Two days later--that is, on
Wednesday last--there is a curt announcement

00:09:16.400 --> 00:09:19.620
that the wedding had
taken place, and that the honeymoon would

00:09:19.620 --> 00:09:24.180
be passed at Lord
Backwater's place, near Petersfield.

00:09:24.180 --> 00:09:27.140
Those are all the notices
which appeared before the disappearance of

00:09:27.140 --> 00:09:28.280
the bride."

00:09:28.280 --> 00:09:32.740
"Before the what?" asked Holmes with a start.

00:09:32.740 --> 00:09:35.030
"The vanishing of the lady."

00:09:35.030 --> 00:09:37.490
"When did she vanish, then?"

00:09:37.490 --> 00:09:40.310
"At the wedding breakfast."

00:09:40.310 --> 00:09:41.470
"Indeed.

00:09:41.470 --> 00:09:44.870
This is more interesting than it promised
to be; quite

00:09:44.870 --> 00:09:46.850
dramatic, in fact."

00:09:46.850 --> 00:09:49.930
"Yes; it struck me as being a little out of
the common."

00:09:49.930 --> 00:09:54.770
"They often vanish before the ceremony, and
occasionally during

00:09:54.770 --> 00:09:58.880
the honeymoon; but I cannot call to mind anything
quite so prompt

00:09:58.880 --> 00:10:00.360
as this.

00:10:00.360 --> 00:10:02.470
Pray let me have the details."

00:10:02.470 --> 00:10:05.410
"I warn you that they are very incomplete."

00:10:05.410 --> 00:10:08.280
"Perhaps we may make them less so."

00:10:08.280 --> 00:10:12.790
"Such as they are, they are set forth in a
single article of a

00:10:12.790 --> 00:10:16.150
morning paper of yesterday, which I will read
to you.

00:10:16.150 --> 00:10:19.760
It is
headed, 'Singular Occurrence at a Fashionable

00:10:19.760 --> 00:10:20.760
Wedding':

00:10:20.760 --> 00:10:24.710
"'The family of Lord Robert St. Simon has
been thrown into the

00:10:24.710 --> 00:10:29.500
greatest consternation by the strange and
painful episodes which

00:10:29.500 --> 00:10:32.580
have taken place in connection with his wedding.

00:10:32.580 --> 00:10:36.760
The ceremony, as
shortly announced in the papers of yesterday,

00:10:36.760 --> 00:10:40.290
occurred on the
previous morning; but it is only now that

00:10:40.290 --> 00:10:44.170
it has been possible to
confirm the strange rumours which have been

00:10:44.170 --> 00:10:46.900
so persistently
floating about.

00:10:46.900 --> 00:10:49.080
In spite of the attempts of the friends to
hush

00:10:49.080 --> 00:10:54.020
the matter up, so much public attention has
now been drawn to it

00:10:54.020 --> 00:10:57.900
that no good purpose can be served by affecting
to disregard what

00:10:57.900 --> 00:11:00.700
is a common subject for conversation.

00:11:00.700 --> 00:11:05.490
"'The ceremony, which was performed at St.
George's, Hanover

00:11:05.490 --> 00:11:09.400
Square, was a very quiet one, no one being
present save the

00:11:09.400 --> 00:11:14.900
father of the bride, Mr. Aloysius Doran, the
Duchess of Balmoral,

00:11:14.900 --> 00:11:20.360
Lord Backwater, Lord Eustace and Lady Clara
St. Simon (the

00:11:20.360 --> 00:11:24.280
younger brother and sister of the bridegroom),
and Lady Alicia

00:11:24.280 --> 00:11:25.280
Whittington.

00:11:25.280 --> 00:11:28.250
The whole party proceeded afterwards to the
house of

00:11:28.250 --> 00:11:32.740
Mr. Aloysius Doran, at Lancaster Gate, where
breakfast had been

00:11:32.740 --> 00:11:34.050
prepared.

00:11:34.050 --> 00:11:36.480
It appears that some little trouble was caused
by a

00:11:36.480 --> 00:11:40.460
woman, whose name has not been ascertained,
who endeavoured to

00:11:40.460 --> 00:11:44.490
force her way into the house after the bridal
party, alleging

00:11:44.490 --> 00:11:48.550
that she had some claim upon Lord St. Simon.

00:11:48.550 --> 00:11:52.950
It was only after a
painful and prolonged scene that she was ejected

00:11:52.950 --> 00:11:55.400
by the butler
and the footman.

00:11:55.400 --> 00:11:57.900
The bride, who had fortunately entered the
house

00:11:57.900 --> 00:12:02.430
before this unpleasant interruption, had sat
down to breakfast

00:12:02.430 --> 00:12:06.670
with the rest, when she complained of a sudden
indisposition and

00:12:06.670 --> 00:12:08.500
retired to her room.

00:12:08.500 --> 00:12:13.680
Her prolonged absence having caused some
comment, her father followed her, but learned

00:12:13.680 --> 00:12:17.420
from her maid that
she had only come up to her chamber for an

00:12:17.420 --> 00:12:21.370
instant, caught up an
ulster and bonnet, and hurried down to the

00:12:21.370 --> 00:12:22.750
passage.

00:12:22.750 --> 00:12:25.250
One of the
footmen declared that he had seen a lady leave

00:12:25.250 --> 00:12:28.690
the house thus
`apparelled`, but had refused to credit that

00:12:28.690 --> 00:12:33.120
it was his mistress,
believing her to be with the company.

00:12:33.120 --> 00:12:37.640
On ascertaining that his
daughter had disappeared, Mr. Aloysius Doran,

00:12:37.640 --> 00:12:41.290
in conjunction with
the bridegroom, instantly put themselves in

00:12:41.290 --> 00:12:45.370
communication with
the police, and very energetic inquiries are

00:12:45.370 --> 00:12:48.920
being made, which
will probably result in a speedy clearing

00:12:48.920 --> 00:12:52.000
up of this very
singular business.

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:56.930
Up to a late hour last night, however, nothing
had transpired as to the whereabouts of the

00:12:56.930 --> 00:12:58.500
missing lady.

00:12:58.500 --> 00:13:01.450
There
are rumours of foul play in the matter, and

00:13:01.450 --> 00:13:04.500
it is said that the
police have caused the arrest of the woman

00:13:04.500 --> 00:13:08.690
who had caused the
original disturbance, in the belief that,

00:13:08.690 --> 00:13:12.310
from jealousy or some
other motive, she may have been concerned

00:13:12.310 --> 00:13:15.140
in the strange
disappearance of the bride.'"

00:13:15.140 --> 00:13:17.700
"And is that all?"

00:13:17.700 --> 00:13:21.820
"Only one little item in another of the morning
papers, but it is

00:13:21.820 --> 00:13:23.510
a suggestive one."

00:13:23.510 --> 00:13:25.250
"And it is--"

00:13:25.250 --> 00:13:30.360
"That Miss Flora Millar, the lady who had
caused the disturbance,

00:13:30.360 --> 00:13:32.690
has actually been arrested.

00:13:32.690 --> 00:13:36.950
It appears that she was formerly a
danseuse at the Allegro, and that she has

00:13:36.950 --> 00:13:39.570
known the bridegroom
for some years.

00:13:39.570 --> 00:13:41.860
There are no further particulars, and the
whole

00:13:41.860 --> 00:13:46.160
case is in your hands now--so far as it has
been set forth in the

00:13:46.160 --> 00:13:47.190
public press."

00:13:47.190 --> 00:13:51.730
"And an exceedingly interesting case it appears
to be.

00:13:51.730 --> 00:13:54.620
I would
not have missed it for worlds.

00:13:54.620 --> 00:13:58.700
But there is a ring at the bell,
Watson, and as the clock makes it a few minutes

00:13:58.700 --> 00:14:01.800
after four, I
have no doubt that this will prove to be our

00:14:01.800 --> 00:14:03.560
noble client.

00:14:03.560 --> 00:14:06.460
Do not
dream of going, Watson, for I very much prefer

00:14:06.460 --> 00:14:09.680
having a witness,
if only as a check to my own memory."

00:14:09.680 --> 00:14:15.770
"Lord Robert St. Simon," announced our page-boy,
throwing open

00:14:15.770 --> 00:14:17.060
the door.

00:14:17.060 --> 00:14:20.540
A gentleman entered, with a pleasant, cultured
face,

00:14:20.540 --> 00:14:24.740
high-nosed and pale, with something perhaps
of petulance about

00:14:24.740 --> 00:14:28.340
the mouth, and with the steady, well-opened
eye of a man whose

00:14:28.340 --> 00:14:33.000
pleasant lot it had ever been to command and
to be obeyed.

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:35.890
His
manner was `brisk`, and yet his general appearance

00:14:35.890 --> 00:14:39.900
gave an undue
impression of age, for he had a slight forward

00:14:39.900 --> 00:14:43.690
stoop and a little
bend of the knees as he walked.

00:14:43.690 --> 00:14:48.910
His hair, too, as he swept off
his very curly-`brimmed` hat, was grizzled round

00:14:48.910 --> 00:14:51.830
the edges and thin
upon the top.

00:14:51.830 --> 00:14:55.180
As to his dress, it was careful to the verge
of

00:14:55.180 --> 00:15:00.140
foppishness, with high collar, black frock-coat,
white waistcoat,

00:15:00.140 --> 00:15:05.380
yellow gloves, patent-leather shoes, and light-coloured
gaiters.

00:15:05.380 --> 00:15:09.230
He advanced slowly into the room, turning
his head from left to

00:15:09.230 --> 00:15:12.500
right, and swinging in his right hand the
cord which held his

00:15:12.500 --> 00:15:14.430
golden eyeglasses.

00:15:14.430 --> 00:15:19.570
"Good-day, Lord St. Simon," said Holmes, rising
and bowing.

00:15:19.570 --> 00:15:22.380
"Pray
take the basket-chair.

00:15:22.380 --> 00:15:25.670
This is my friend and colleague, Dr.
Watson.

00:15:25.670 --> 00:15:28.010
Draw up a little to the fire, and we will
talk this

00:15:28.010 --> 00:15:29.750
matter over."

00:15:29.750 --> 00:15:35.450
"A most painful matter to me, as you can most
readily imagine,

00:15:35.450 --> 00:15:36.580
Mr. Holmes.

00:15:36.580 --> 00:15:39.140
I have been cut to the quick.

00:15:39.140 --> 00:15:43.500
I understand that you
have already managed several delicate cases

00:15:43.500 --> 00:15:47.310
of this sort, sir,
though I presume that they were hardly from

00:15:47.310 --> 00:15:49.040
the same class of
society."

00:15:49.040 --> 00:15:52.030
"No, I am descending."

00:15:52.030 --> 00:15:54.400
"I beg pardon."

00:15:54.400 --> 00:15:57.890
"My last client of the sort was a king."

00:15:57.890 --> 00:15:59.370
"Oh, really!

00:15:59.370 --> 00:16:01.880
I had no idea.

00:16:01.880 --> 00:16:03.110
And which king?"

00:16:03.110 --> 00:16:04.980
"The King of Scandinavia."

00:16:04.980 --> 00:16:07.020
"What!

00:16:07.020 --> 00:16:08.880
Had he lost his wife?"

00:16:08.880 --> 00:16:14.130
"You can understand," said Holmes suavely,
"that I extend to the

00:16:14.130 --> 00:16:18.090
affairs of my other clients the same secrecy
which I promise to

00:16:18.090 --> 00:16:19.530
you in yours."

00:16:19.530 --> 00:16:21.180
"Of course!

00:16:21.180 --> 00:16:22.990
Very right! very right!

00:16:22.990 --> 00:16:25.060
I'm sure I beg pardon.

00:16:25.060 --> 00:16:29.660
As to
my own case, I am ready to give you any information

00:16:29.660 --> 00:16:32.510
which may
assist you in forming an opinion."

00:16:32.510 --> 00:16:34.550
"Thank you.

00:16:34.550 --> 00:16:37.180
I have already learned all that is in the
public

00:16:37.180 --> 00:16:38.700
prints, nothing more.

00:16:38.700 --> 00:16:44.981
I presume that I may take it as correct--this
article, for example, as to the disappearance

00:16:44.981 --> 00:16:47.070
of the bride."

00:16:47.070 --> 00:16:49.390
Lord St. Simon glanced over it.

00:16:49.390 --> 00:16:52.670
"Yes, it is correct, as far as it
goes."

00:16:52.670 --> 00:16:56.760
"But it needs a great deal of supplementing
before anyone could

00:16:56.760 --> 00:16:58.690
offer an opinion.

00:16:58.690 --> 00:17:03.400
I think that I may arrive at my facts most
directly by questioning you."

00:17:03.400 --> 00:17:05.740
"Pray do so."

00:17:05.740 --> 00:17:08.930
"When did you first meet Miss Hatty Doran?"

00:17:08.930 --> 00:17:12.390
"In San Francisco, a year ago."

00:17:12.390 --> 00:17:15.470
"You were travelling in the States?"

00:17:15.470 --> 00:17:16.470
"Yes."

00:17:16.470 --> 00:17:19.760
"Did you become engaged then?"

00:17:19.760 --> 00:17:20.760
"No."

00:17:20.760 --> 00:17:23.800
"But you were on a friendly footing?"

00:17:23.800 --> 00:17:29.370
"I was amused by her society, and she could
see that I was

00:17:29.370 --> 00:17:30.370
amused."

00:17:30.370 --> 00:17:33.030
"Her father is very rich?"

00:17:33.030 --> 00:17:36.730
"He is said to be the richest man on the Pacific
slope."

00:17:36.730 --> 00:17:40.050
"And how did he make his money?"

00:17:40.050 --> 00:17:41.790
"In mining.

00:17:41.790 --> 00:17:44.300
He had nothing a few years ago.

00:17:44.300 --> 00:17:49.510
Then he struck gold,
invested it, and came up by leaps and bounds."

00:17:49.510 --> 00:17:54.520
"Now, what is your own impression as to the
young lady's--your

00:17:54.520 --> 00:17:56.890
wife's character?"

00:17:56.890 --> 00:18:00.470
The nobleman swung his glasses a little faster
and stared down

00:18:00.470 --> 00:18:01.770
into the fire.

00:18:01.770 --> 00:18:10.320
"You see, Mr. Holmes," said he, "my wife was
twenty before her father became a rich man.

00:18:10.320 --> 00:18:14.180
During that time she
ran free in a mining camp and wandered through

00:18:14.180 --> 00:18:17.620
woods or
mountains, so that her education has come

00:18:17.620 --> 00:18:21.260
from Nature rather than
from the schoolmaster.

00:18:21.260 --> 00:18:27.970
She is what we call in England a tomboy,
with a strong nature, wild and free, unfettered

00:18:27.970 --> 00:18:30.270
by any sort of
traditions.

00:18:30.270 --> 00:18:35.490
She is impetuous--volcanic, I was about to
say.

00:18:35.490 --> 00:18:38.180
She
is swift in making up her mind and fearless

00:18:38.180 --> 00:18:39.970
in carrying out her
resolutions.

00:18:39.970 --> 00:18:43.490
On the other hand, I would not have given
her the

00:18:43.490 --> 00:18:47.560
name which I have the honour to bear"--he
gave a little stately

00:18:47.560 --> 00:18:54.040
cough--"had not I thought her to be at bottom
a noble woman.

00:18:54.040 --> 00:18:57.530
I
believe that she is capable of heroic self-sacrifice

00:18:57.530 --> 00:19:00.730
and that
anything dishonourable would be repugnant

00:19:00.730 --> 00:19:01.990
to her."

00:19:01.990 --> 00:19:04.340
"Have you her photograph?"

00:19:04.340 --> 00:19:07.590
"I brought this with me."

00:19:07.590 --> 00:19:12.370
He opened a locket and showed us the
full face of a very lovely woman.

00:19:12.370 --> 00:19:16.670
It was not a photograph but an
ivory miniature, and the artist had brought

00:19:16.670 --> 00:19:20.590
out the full effect
of the lustrous black hair, the large dark

00:19:20.590 --> 00:19:23.980
eyes, and the
exquisite mouth.

00:19:23.980 --> 00:19:26.400
Holmes gazed long and earnestly at it.

00:19:26.400 --> 00:19:29.690
Then he
closed the locket and handed it back to Lord

00:19:29.690 --> 00:19:30.980
St. Simon.

00:19:30.980 --> 00:19:34.990
"The young lady came to London, then, and
you renewed your

00:19:34.990 --> 00:19:35.990
acquaintance?"

00:19:35.990 --> 00:19:40.970
"Yes, her father brought her over for this
last London season.

00:19:40.970 --> 00:19:44.550
I
met her several times, became engaged to her,

00:19:44.550 --> 00:19:46.520
and have now
married her."

00:19:46.520 --> 00:19:50.970
"She brought, I understand, a considerable
dowry?"

00:19:50.970 --> 00:19:53.300
"A fair dowry.

00:19:53.300 --> 00:19:55.490
Not more than is usual in my family."

00:19:55.490 --> 00:19:59.981
"And this, of course, remains to you, since
the marriage is a

00:19:59.981 --> 00:20:01.890
fait accompli?"

00:20:01.890 --> 00:20:06.490
"I really have made no inquiries on the subject."

00:20:06.490 --> 00:20:08.930
"Very naturally not.

00:20:08.930 --> 00:20:12.760
Did you see Miss Doran on the day before the
wedding?"

00:20:12.760 --> 00:20:13.850
"Yes."

00:20:13.850 --> 00:20:17.060
"Was she in good spirits?"

00:20:17.060 --> 00:20:18.620
"Never better.

00:20:18.620 --> 00:20:22.040
She kept talking of what we should do in our
future lives."

00:20:22.040 --> 00:20:24.150
"Indeed!

00:20:24.150 --> 00:20:26.410
That is very interesting.

00:20:26.410 --> 00:20:28.220
And on the morning of the
wedding?"

00:20:28.220 --> 00:20:32.540
"She was as bright as possible--at least until
after the

00:20:32.540 --> 00:20:33.540
ceremony."

00:20:33.540 --> 00:20:38.340
"And did you observe any change in her then?"

00:20:38.340 --> 00:20:43.231
"Well, to tell the truth, I saw then the first
signs that I had

00:20:43.231 --> 00:20:47.700
ever seen that her temper was just a little
sharp.

00:20:47.700 --> 00:20:50.940
The incident
however, was too trivial to relate and can

00:20:50.940 --> 00:20:53.840
have no possible
bearing upon the case."

00:20:53.840 --> 00:20:56.980
"Pray let us have it, for all that."

00:20:56.980 --> 00:20:59.770
"Oh, it is childish.

00:20:59.770 --> 00:21:03.360
She dropped her bouquet as we went towards
the vestry.

00:21:03.360 --> 00:21:05.760
She was passing the front pew at the time,
and it

00:21:05.760 --> 00:21:08.160
fell over into the pew.

00:21:08.160 --> 00:21:13.290
There was a moment's delay, but the
gentleman in the pew handed it up to her again,

00:21:13.290 --> 00:21:15.970
and it did not
appear to be the worse for the fall.

00:21:15.970 --> 00:21:21.090
Yet when I spoke to her of
the matter, she answered me abruptly; and

00:21:21.090 --> 00:21:25.300
in the carriage, on our
way home, she seemed absurdly agitated over

00:21:25.300 --> 00:21:28.180
this trifling cause."

00:21:28.180 --> 00:21:29.510
"Indeed!

00:21:29.510 --> 00:21:32.610
You say that there was a gentleman in the
pew.

00:21:32.610 --> 00:21:35.410
Some of
the general public were present, then?"

00:21:35.410 --> 00:21:36.870
"Oh, yes.

00:21:36.870 --> 00:21:39.550
It is impossible to exclude them when the
church is

00:21:39.550 --> 00:21:40.550
open."

00:21:40.550 --> 00:21:44.390
"This gentleman was not one of your wife's
friends?"

00:21:44.390 --> 00:21:49.620
"No, no; I call him a gentleman by courtesy,
but he was quite a

00:21:49.620 --> 00:21:51.600
common-looking person.

00:21:51.600 --> 00:21:54.090
I hardly noticed his appearance.

00:21:54.090 --> 00:21:56.260
But
really I think that we are wandering rather

00:21:56.260 --> 00:21:58.150
far from the point."

00:21:58.150 --> 00:22:02.290
"Lady St. Simon, then, returned from the wedding
in a less

00:22:02.290 --> 00:22:06.020
cheerful frame of mind than she had gone to
it.

00:22:06.020 --> 00:22:09.310
What did she do
on re-entering her father's house?"

00:22:09.310 --> 00:22:13.010
"I saw her in conversation with her maid."

00:22:13.010 --> 00:22:15.230
"And who is her maid?"

00:22:15.230 --> 00:22:17.300
"Alice is her name.

00:22:17.300 --> 00:22:20.940
She is an American and came from California
with her."

00:22:20.940 --> 00:22:23.390
"A confidential servant?"

00:22:23.390 --> 00:22:26.200
"A little too much so.

00:22:26.200 --> 00:22:30.280
It seemed to me that her mistress allowed
her to take great liberties.

00:22:30.280 --> 00:22:35.490
Still, of course, in America they
look upon these things in a different way."

00:22:35.490 --> 00:22:38.380
"How long did she speak to this Alice?"

00:22:38.380 --> 00:22:40.860
"Oh, a few minutes.

00:22:40.860 --> 00:22:43.190
I had something else to think of."

00:22:43.190 --> 00:22:46.170
"You did not overhear what they said?"

00:22:46.170 --> 00:22:51.230
"Lady St. Simon said something about 'jumping
a claim.'

00:22:51.230 --> 00:22:53.820
She was
accustomed to use slang of the kind.

00:22:53.820 --> 00:22:56.620
I have no idea what she
meant."

00:22:56.620 --> 00:23:00.780
"American slang is very expressive sometimes.

00:23:00.780 --> 00:23:03.820
And what did your
wife do when she finished speaking to her

00:23:03.820 --> 00:23:04.820
maid?"

00:23:04.820 --> 00:23:07.800
"She walked into the breakfast-room."

00:23:07.800 --> 00:23:09.520
"On your arm?"

00:23:09.520 --> 00:23:11.360
"No, alone.

00:23:11.360 --> 00:23:14.910
She was very independent in little matters
like that.

00:23:14.910 --> 00:23:19.240
Then, after we had sat down for ten minutes
or so, she rose

00:23:19.240 --> 00:23:23.520
hurriedly, muttered some words of apology,
and left the room.

00:23:23.520 --> 00:23:24.520
She
never came back."

00:23:24.520 --> 00:23:30.250
"But this maid, Alice, as I understand, deposes
that she went to

00:23:30.250 --> 00:23:34.600
her room, covered her bride's dress with a
long ulster, put on a

00:23:34.600 --> 00:23:36.230
bonnet, and went out."

00:23:36.230 --> 00:23:37.970
"Quite so.

00:23:37.970 --> 00:23:40.630
And she was afterwards seen walking into Hyde
Park in

00:23:40.630 --> 00:23:45.140
company with Flora Millar, a woman who is
now in custody, and who

00:23:45.140 --> 00:23:48.200
had already made a disturbance at Mr. Doran's
house that

00:23:48.200 --> 00:23:49.200
morning."

00:23:49.200 --> 00:23:50.990
"Ah, yes.

00:23:50.990 --> 00:23:54.460
I should like a few particulars as to this
young lady,

00:23:54.460 --> 00:23:57.560
and your relations to her."

00:23:57.560 --> 00:24:01.140
Lord St. Simon shrugged his shoulders and
raised his eyebrows.

00:24:01.140 --> 00:24:06.900
"We have been on a friendly footing for some
years--I may say on

00:24:06.900 --> 00:24:10.120
a very friendly footing.

00:24:10.120 --> 00:24:12.309
She used to be at the Allegro.

00:24:12.309 --> 00:24:15.700
I have
not treated her ungenerously, and she had

00:24:15.700 --> 00:24:20.059
no just cause of
complaint against me, but you know what women

00:24:20.059 --> 00:24:21.660
are, Mr. Holmes.

00:24:21.660 --> 00:24:26.200
Flora was a dear little thing, but exceedingly
hot-headed and

00:24:26.200 --> 00:24:28.690
devotedly attached to me.

00:24:28.690 --> 00:24:33.420
She wrote me dreadful letters when she
heard that I was about to be married, and,

00:24:33.420 --> 00:24:36.990
to tell the truth, the
reason why I had the marriage celebrated so

00:24:36.990 --> 00:24:40.530
quietly was that I
feared lest there might be a scandal in the

00:24:40.530 --> 00:24:41.960
church.

00:24:41.960 --> 00:24:46.130
She came to
Mr. Doran's door just after we returned, and

00:24:46.130 --> 00:24:50.400
she endeavoured to
push her way in, uttering very abusive expressions

00:24:50.400 --> 00:24:54.420
towards my
wife, and even threatening her, but I had

00:24:54.420 --> 00:24:57.611
foreseen the
possibility of something of the sort, and

00:24:57.611 --> 00:25:01.010
I had two police
fellows there in private clothes, who soon

00:25:01.010 --> 00:25:02.980
pushed her out again.

00:25:02.980 --> 00:25:05.820
She was quiet when she saw that there was
no good in making a

00:25:05.820 --> 00:25:06.820
row."

00:25:06.820 --> 00:25:09.780
"Did your wife hear all this?"

00:25:09.780 --> 00:25:12.950
"No, thank goodness, she did not."

00:25:12.950 --> 00:25:17.360
"And she was seen walking with this very woman
afterwards?"

00:25:17.360 --> 00:25:18.800
"Yes.

00:25:18.800 --> 00:25:22.370
That is what Mr. Lestrade, of Scotland Yard,
looks upon as

00:25:22.370 --> 00:25:23.950
so serious.

00:25:23.950 --> 00:25:26.910
It is thought that Flora decoyed my wife out
and laid

00:25:26.910 --> 00:25:29.390
some terrible trap for her."

00:25:29.390 --> 00:25:32.140
"Well, it is a possible supposition."

00:25:32.140 --> 00:25:35.270
"You think so, too?"

00:25:35.270 --> 00:25:38.540
"I did not say a probable one.

00:25:38.540 --> 00:25:42.070
But you do not yourself look upon
this as likely?"

00:25:42.070 --> 00:25:45.040
"I do not think Flora would hurt a fly."

00:25:45.040 --> 00:25:51.330
"Still, jealousy is a strange transformer
of characters.

00:25:51.330 --> 00:25:54.780
Pray
what is your own theory as to what took place?"

00:25:54.780 --> 00:26:00.410
"Well, really, I came to seek a theory, not
to propound one.

00:26:00.410 --> 00:26:03.300
I
have given you all the facts.

00:26:03.300 --> 00:26:08.800
Since you ask me, however, I may
say that it has occurred to me as possible

00:26:08.800 --> 00:26:12.300
that the excitement of
this affair, the consciousness that she had

00:26:12.300 --> 00:26:16.900
made so immense a
social stride, had the effect of causing some

00:26:16.900 --> 00:26:19.670
little nervous
disturbance in my wife."

00:26:19.670 --> 00:26:23.870
"In short, that she had become suddenly deranged?"

00:26:23.870 --> 00:26:29.130
"Well, really, when I consider that she has
turned her back--I

00:26:29.130 --> 00:26:33.309
will not say upon me, but upon so much that
many have aspired to

00:26:33.309 --> 00:26:37.600
without success--I can hardly explain it in
any other fashion."

00:26:37.600 --> 00:26:43.190
"Well, certainly that is also a conceivable
hypothesis," said

00:26:43.190 --> 00:26:44.290
Holmes, smiling.

00:26:44.290 --> 00:26:49.380
"And now, Lord St. Simon, I think that I have
nearly all my data.

00:26:49.380 --> 00:26:54.540
May I ask whether you were seated at the
breakfast-table so that you could see out

00:26:54.540 --> 00:26:55.760
of the window?"

00:26:55.760 --> 00:27:00.030
"We could see the other side of the road and
the Park."

00:27:00.030 --> 00:27:01.670
"Quite so.

00:27:01.670 --> 00:27:04.630
Then I do not think that I need to detain
you longer.

00:27:04.630 --> 00:27:06.850
I shall communicate with you."

00:27:06.850 --> 00:27:11.240
"Should you be fortunate enough to solve this
problem," said our

00:27:11.240 --> 00:27:12.580
client, rising.

00:27:12.580 --> 00:27:14.980
"I have solved it."

00:27:14.980 --> 00:27:16.040
"Eh?

00:27:16.040 --> 00:27:17.420
What was that?"

00:27:17.420 --> 00:27:20.140
"I say that I have solved it."

00:27:20.140 --> 00:27:22.490
"Where, then, is my wife?"

00:27:22.490 --> 00:27:27.420
"That is a detail which I shall speedily supply."

00:27:27.420 --> 00:27:29.480
Lord St. Simon shook his head.

00:27:29.480 --> 00:27:35.890
"I am afraid that it will take
wiser heads than yours or mine," he remarked,

00:27:35.890 --> 00:27:39.940
and bowing in a
stately, old-fashioned manner he departed.

00:27:39.940 --> 00:27:44.809
"It is very good of Lord St. Simon to honour
my head by putting

00:27:44.809 --> 00:27:48.940
it on a level with his own," said Sherlock
Holmes, laughing.

00:27:48.940 --> 00:27:51.530
"I
think that I shall have a whisky and soda

00:27:51.530 --> 00:27:55.000
and a cigar after all
this cross-questioning.

00:27:55.000 --> 00:28:00.179
I had formed my conclusions as to the
case before our client came into the room."

00:28:00.179 --> 00:28:02.400
"My dear Holmes!"

00:28:02.400 --> 00:28:06.640
"I have notes of several similar cases, though
none, as I

00:28:06.640 --> 00:28:09.720
remarked before, which were quite as prompt.

00:28:09.720 --> 00:28:14.820
My whole examination
served to turn my conjecture into a certainty.

00:28:14.820 --> 00:28:18.180
Circumstantial
evidence is occasionally very convincing,

00:28:18.180 --> 00:28:21.810
as when you find a
trout in the milk, to quote Thoreau's example."

00:28:21.810 --> 00:28:25.910
"But I have heard all that you have heard."

00:28:25.910 --> 00:28:29.210
"Without, however, the knowledge of pre-existing
cases which

00:28:29.210 --> 00:28:31.070
serves me so well.

00:28:31.070 --> 00:28:33.560
There was a parallel instance in Aberdeen
some

00:28:33.560 --> 00:28:37.360
years back, and something on very much the
same lines at Munich

00:28:37.360 --> 00:28:39.840
the year after the Franco-Prussian War.

00:28:39.840 --> 00:28:45.390
It is one of these
cases--but, hullo, here is Lestrade!

00:28:45.390 --> 00:28:47.480
Good-afternoon, Lestrade!

00:28:47.480 --> 00:28:50.480
You will find an extra tumbler upon the sideboard,
and there are

00:28:50.480 --> 00:28:53.170
cigars in the box."

00:28:53.170 --> 00:28:57.200
The official detective was attired in a pea-jacket
and cravat,

00:28:57.200 --> 00:29:00.750
which gave him a decidedly nautical appearance,
and he carried a

00:29:00.750 --> 00:29:03.410
black canvas bag in his hand.

00:29:03.410 --> 00:29:07.410
With a short greeting he seated
himself and lit the cigar which had been offered

00:29:07.410 --> 00:29:08.470
to him.

00:29:08.470 --> 00:29:13.090
"What's up, then?" asked Holmes with a twinkle
in his eye.

00:29:13.090 --> 00:29:14.890
"You
look dissatisfied."

00:29:14.890 --> 00:29:18.570
"And I feel dissatisfied.

00:29:18.570 --> 00:29:23.010
It is this infernal St. Simon marriage
case.

00:29:23.010 --> 00:29:26.950
I can make neither head nor tail of the business."

00:29:26.950 --> 00:29:28.010
"Really!

00:29:28.010 --> 00:29:29.520
You surprise me."

00:29:29.520 --> 00:29:33.440
"Who ever heard of such a mixed affair?

00:29:33.440 --> 00:29:36.059
Every clue seems to slip
through my fingers.

00:29:36.059 --> 00:29:39.260
I have been at work upon it all day."

00:29:39.260 --> 00:29:43.440
"And very wet it seems to have made you,"
said Holmes laying his

00:29:43.440 --> 00:29:45.040
hand upon the arm of the pea-jacket.

00:29:45.040 --> 00:29:49.590
"Yes, I have been dragging the Serpentine."

00:29:49.590 --> 00:29:52.280
"In heaven's name, what for?"

00:29:52.280 --> 00:29:56.850
"In search of the body of Lady St. Simon."

00:29:56.850 --> 00:29:59.900
Sherlock Holmes leaned back in his chair and
laughed heartily.

00:29:59.900 --> 00:30:05.690
"Have you dragged the basin of Trafalgar Square
fountain?" he

00:30:05.690 --> 00:30:06.690
asked.

00:30:06.690 --> 00:30:07.690
"Why?

00:30:07.690 --> 00:30:09.160
What do you mean?"

00:30:09.160 --> 00:30:12.350
"Because you have just as good a chance of
finding this lady in

00:30:12.350 --> 00:30:14.170
the one as in the other."

00:30:14.170 --> 00:30:17.960
Lestrade shot an angry glance at my companion.

00:30:17.960 --> 00:30:22.630
"I suppose you
know all about it," he snarled.

00:30:22.630 --> 00:30:27.770
"Well, I have only just heard the facts, but
my mind is made up."

00:30:27.770 --> 00:30:29.570
"Oh, indeed!

00:30:29.570 --> 00:30:32.320
Then you think that the Serpentine plays no
part in

00:30:32.320 --> 00:30:33.420
the matter?"

00:30:33.420 --> 00:30:35.600
"I think it very unlikely."

00:30:35.600 --> 00:30:40.420
"Then perhaps you will kindly explain how
it is that we found

00:30:40.420 --> 00:30:42.380
this in it?"

00:30:42.380 --> 00:30:45.470
He opened his bag as he spoke, and tumbled
onto the

00:30:45.470 --> 00:30:49.390
floor a wedding-dress of watered silk, a pair
of white satin

00:30:49.390 --> 00:30:53.640
shoes and a bride's wreath and veil, all discoloured
and soaked

00:30:53.640 --> 00:30:55.110
in water.

00:30:55.110 --> 00:30:58.549
"There," said he, putting a new wedding-ring
upon the

00:30:58.549 --> 00:30:59.860
top of the pile.

00:30:59.860 --> 00:31:04.100
"There is a little nut for you to crack, Master
Holmes."

00:31:04.100 --> 00:31:09.150
"Oh, indeed!" said my friend, blowing blue
rings into the air.

00:31:09.150 --> 00:31:12.600
"You dragged them from the Serpentine?"

00:31:12.600 --> 00:31:13.600
"No.

00:31:13.600 --> 00:31:16.250
They were found floating near the margin by
a park-keeper.

00:31:16.250 --> 00:31:20.750
They have been identified as her clothes,
and it seemed to me

00:31:20.750 --> 00:31:24.430
that if the clothes were there the body would
not be far off."

00:31:24.430 --> 00:31:29.420
"By the same brilliant reasoning, every man's
body is to be found

00:31:29.420 --> 00:31:31.679
in the neighbourhood of his wardrobe.

00:31:31.679 --> 00:31:35.690
And pray what did you hope
to arrive at through this?"

00:31:35.690 --> 00:31:40.430
"At some evidence implicating Flora Millar
in the disappearance."

00:31:40.430 --> 00:31:43.770
"I am afraid that you will find it difficult."

00:31:43.770 --> 00:31:47.460
"Are you, indeed, now?"

00:31:47.460 --> 00:31:49.330
cried Lestrade with some bitterness.

00:31:49.330 --> 00:31:52.770
"I
am afraid, Holmes, that you are not very practical

00:31:52.770 --> 00:31:54.930
with your
deductions and your inferences.

00:31:54.930 --> 00:31:58.910
You have made two blunders in as
many minutes.

00:31:58.910 --> 00:32:02.550
This dress does implicate Miss Flora Millar."

00:32:02.550 --> 00:32:04.130
"And how?"

00:32:04.130 --> 00:32:06.900
"In the dress is a pocket.

00:32:06.900 --> 00:32:09.190
In the pocket is a card-case.

00:32:09.190 --> 00:32:10.651
In the
card-case is a note.

00:32:10.651 --> 00:32:14.060
And here is the very note."

00:32:14.060 --> 00:32:17.110
He slapped it
down upon the table in front of him.

00:32:17.110 --> 00:32:21.429
"Listen to this: 'You will
see me when all is ready.

00:32:21.429 --> 00:32:23.179
Come at once.

00:32:23.179 --> 00:32:24.679
F.H.M.'

00:32:24.679 --> 00:32:28.540
Now my theory all
along has been that Lady St. Simon was decoyed

00:32:28.540 --> 00:32:32.280
away by Flora
Millar, and that she, with confederates, no

00:32:32.280 --> 00:32:36.059
doubt, was
responsible for her disappearance.

00:32:36.059 --> 00:32:40.549
Here, signed with her
initials, is the very note which was no doubt

00:32:40.549 --> 00:32:43.980
quietly slipped
into her hand at the door and which lured

00:32:43.980 --> 00:32:45.490
her within their
reach."

00:32:45.490 --> 00:32:50.990
"Very good, Lestrade," said Holmes, laughing.

00:32:50.990 --> 00:32:54.080
"You really are
very fine indeed.

00:32:54.080 --> 00:32:55.870
Let me see it."

00:32:55.870 --> 00:32:59.820
He took up the paper in a
`listless` way, but his attention instantly

00:32:59.820 --> 00:33:03.700
became riveted, and he
gave a little cry of satisfaction.

00:33:03.700 --> 00:33:07.830
"This is indeed important,"
said he.

00:33:07.830 --> 00:33:10.340
"Ha! you find it so?"

00:33:10.340 --> 00:33:12.130
"Extremely so.

00:33:12.130 --> 00:33:14.160
I congratulate you warmly."

00:33:14.160 --> 00:33:19.210
Lestrade rose in his triumph and bent his
head to look.

00:33:19.210 --> 00:33:23.700
"Why," he
shrieked, "you're looking at the wrong side!"

00:33:23.700 --> 00:33:26.680
"On the contrary, this is the right side."

00:33:26.680 --> 00:33:29.230
"The right side?

00:33:29.230 --> 00:33:30.940
You're mad!

00:33:30.940 --> 00:33:34.000
Here is the note written in pencil
over here."

00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:38.010
"And over here is what appears to be the fragment
of a hotel

00:33:38.010 --> 00:33:40.299
bill, which interests me deeply."

00:33:40.299 --> 00:33:42.880
"There's nothing in it.

00:33:42.880 --> 00:33:46.380
I looked at it before," said Lestrade.

00:33:46.380 --> 00:33:56.110
"'Oct. 4th, rooms 8s., breakfast 2s. 6d.,
cocktail 1s., lunch 2s.

00:33:56.110 --> 00:33:59.020
6d., glass sherry, 8d.'

00:33:59.020 --> 00:34:01.770
I see nothing in that."

00:34:01.770 --> 00:34:04.030
"Very likely not.

00:34:04.030 --> 00:34:06.860
It is most important, all the same.

00:34:06.860 --> 00:34:10.590
As to the
note, it is important also, or at least the

00:34:10.590 --> 00:34:13.480
initials are, so I
congratulate you again."

00:34:13.480 --> 00:34:18.960
"I've wasted time enough," said Lestrade,
rising.

00:34:18.960 --> 00:34:22.810
"I believe in
hard work and not in sitting by the fire spinning

00:34:22.810 --> 00:34:24.630
fine theories.

00:34:24.630 --> 00:34:28.390
Good-day, Mr. Holmes, and we shall see which
gets to the bottom

00:34:28.390 --> 00:34:31.030
of the matter first."

00:34:31.030 --> 00:34:35.840
He gathered up the garments, thrust them
into the bag, and made for the door.

00:34:35.840 --> 00:34:41.620
"Just one hint to you, Lestrade," drawled
Holmes before his rival

00:34:41.620 --> 00:34:46.179
vanished; "I will tell you the true solution
of the matter.

00:34:46.179 --> 00:34:48.870
Lady
St. Simon is a myth.

00:34:48.870 --> 00:34:52.879
There is not, and there never has been, any
such person."

00:34:52.879 --> 00:34:57.160
Lestrade looked sadly at my companion.

00:34:57.160 --> 00:35:01.460
Then he turned to me,
tapped his forehead three times, shook his

00:35:01.460 --> 00:35:05.060
head solemnly, and
hurried away.

00:35:05.060 --> 00:35:08.370
He had hardly shut the door behind him when
Holmes rose to put on

00:35:08.370 --> 00:35:09.660
his overcoat.

00:35:09.660 --> 00:35:12.440
"There is something in what the fellow says
about

00:35:12.440 --> 00:35:16.619
outdoor work," he remarked, "so I think, Watson,
that I must

00:35:16.619 --> 00:35:20.510
leave you to your papers for a little."

00:35:20.510 --> 00:35:24.030
It was after five o'clock when Sherlock Holmes
left me, but I had

00:35:24.030 --> 00:35:27.320
no time to be lonely, for within an hour there
arrived a

00:35:27.320 --> 00:35:31.320
confectioner's man with a very large flat
box.

00:35:31.320 --> 00:35:33.970
This he unpacked
with the help of a youth whom he had brought

00:35:33.970 --> 00:35:38.140
with him, and
presently, to my very great astonishment,

00:35:38.140 --> 00:35:42.350
a quite epicurean
little cold supper began to be laid out upon

00:35:42.350 --> 00:35:45.340
our humble
lodging-house mahogany.

00:35:45.340 --> 00:35:50.700
There were a couple of brace of cold
woodcock, a pheasant, a pâté de foie gras

00:35:50.700 --> 00:35:55.270
pie with a group of
ancient and cobwebby bottles.

00:35:55.270 --> 00:36:00.320
Having laid out all these luxuries,
my two visitors vanished away, like the genii

00:36:00.320 --> 00:36:04.590
of the Arabian
Nights, with no explanation save that the

00:36:04.590 --> 00:36:09.500
things had been paid
for and were ordered to this address.

00:36:09.500 --> 00:36:13.270
Just before nine o'clock Sherlock Holmes stepped
briskly into the

00:36:13.270 --> 00:36:14.470
room.

00:36:14.470 --> 00:36:17.930
His features were gravely set, but there was
a light in his

00:36:17.930 --> 00:36:21.530
eye which made me think that he had not been
disappointed in his

00:36:21.530 --> 00:36:22.600
conclusions.

00:36:22.600 --> 00:36:28.230
"They have laid the supper, then," he said,
rubbing his hands.

00:36:28.230 --> 00:36:30.700
"You seem to expect company.

00:36:30.700 --> 00:36:32.770
They have laid for five."

00:36:32.770 --> 00:36:37.770
"Yes, I fancy we may have some company dropping
in," said he.

00:36:37.770 --> 00:36:41.590
"I
am surprised that Lord St. Simon has not already

00:36:41.590 --> 00:36:42.590
arrived.

00:36:42.590 --> 00:36:43.590
Ha!

00:36:43.590 --> 00:36:47.570
I
fancy that I hear his step now upon the stairs."

00:36:47.570 --> 00:36:51.619
It was indeed our visitor of the afternoon
who came bustling in,

00:36:51.619 --> 00:36:55.300
dangling his glasses more vigorously than
ever, and with a very

00:36:55.300 --> 00:36:59.150
perturbed expression upon his aristocratic
features.

00:36:59.150 --> 00:37:03.350
"My messenger reached you, then?" asked Holmes.

00:37:03.350 --> 00:37:08.510
"Yes, and I confess that the contents startled
me beyond measure.

00:37:08.510 --> 00:37:11.170
Have you good authority for what you say?"

00:37:11.170 --> 00:37:13.450
"The best possible."

00:37:13.450 --> 00:37:17.990
Lord St. Simon sank into a chair and passed
his hand over his

00:37:17.990 --> 00:37:19.140
forehead.

00:37:19.140 --> 00:37:24.530
"What will the Duke say," he murmured, "when
he hears that one of

00:37:24.530 --> 00:37:28.070
the family has been subjected to such humiliation?"

00:37:28.070 --> 00:37:31.050
"It is the purest accident.

00:37:31.050 --> 00:37:33.760
I cannot allow that there is any
humiliation."

00:37:33.760 --> 00:37:38.050
"Ah, you look on these things from another
standpoint."

00:37:38.050 --> 00:37:42.100
"I fail to see that anyone is to blame.

00:37:42.100 --> 00:37:45.869
I can hardly see how the
lady could have acted otherwise, though her

00:37:45.869 --> 00:37:50.130
abrupt method of
doing it was undoubtedly to be regretted.

00:37:50.130 --> 00:37:54.090
Having no mother, she
had no one to advise her at such a crisis."

00:37:54.090 --> 00:38:00.570
"It was a slight, sir, a public slight," said
Lord St. Simon,

00:38:00.570 --> 00:38:02.810
tapping his fingers upon the table.

00:38:02.810 --> 00:38:06.830
"You must make allowance for this poor girl,
placed in so

00:38:06.830 --> 00:38:09.210
unprecedented a position."

00:38:09.210 --> 00:38:12.000
"I will make no allowance.

00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:15.869
I am very angry indeed, and I have
been shamefully used."

00:38:15.869 --> 00:38:20.770
"I think that I heard a ring," said Holmes.

00:38:20.770 --> 00:38:24.010
"Yes, there are steps
on the landing.

00:38:24.010 --> 00:38:26.300
If I cannot persuade you to take a lenient
view

00:38:26.300 --> 00:38:30.119
of the matter, Lord St. Simon, I have brought
an advocate here

00:38:30.119 --> 00:38:32.930
who may be more successful."

00:38:32.930 --> 00:38:36.350
He opened the door and ushered in a
lady and gentleman.

00:38:36.350 --> 00:38:43.450
"Lord St. Simon," said he "allow me to
introduce you to Mr. and Mrs. Francis Hay

00:38:43.450 --> 00:38:44.640
Moulton.

00:38:44.640 --> 00:38:48.060
The lady, I
think, you have already met."

00:38:48.060 --> 00:38:50.990
At the sight of these newcomers our client
had sprung from his

00:38:50.990 --> 00:38:55.241
seat and stood very erect, with his eyes cast
down and his hand

00:38:55.241 --> 00:38:59.250
thrust into the breast of his frock-coat,
a picture of offended

00:38:59.250 --> 00:39:00.520
dignity.

00:39:00.520 --> 00:39:03.340
The lady had taken a quick step forward and
had held out

00:39:03.340 --> 00:39:07.780
her hand to him, but he still refused to raise
his eyes.

00:39:07.780 --> 00:39:10.841
It was
as well for his resolution, perhaps, for her

00:39:10.841 --> 00:39:14.619
pleading face was
one which it was hard to resist.

00:39:14.619 --> 00:39:18.350
"You're angry, Robert," said she.

00:39:18.350 --> 00:39:21.770
"Well, I guess you have every
cause to be."

00:39:21.770 --> 00:39:26.980
"Pray make no apology to me," said Lord St.
Simon bitterly.

00:39:26.980 --> 00:39:31.560
"Oh, yes, I know that I have treated you real
bad and that I

00:39:31.560 --> 00:39:34.910
should have spoken to you before I went; but
I was kind of

00:39:34.910 --> 00:39:38.520
rattled, and from the time when I saw Frank
here again I just

00:39:38.520 --> 00:39:40.740
didn't know what I was doing or saying.

00:39:40.740 --> 00:39:44.830
I only wonder I didn't
fall down and do a faint right there before

00:39:44.830 --> 00:39:46.240
the altar."

00:39:46.240 --> 00:39:49.520
"Perhaps, Mrs. Moulton, you would like my
friend and me to leave

00:39:49.520 --> 00:39:52.340
the room while you explain this matter?"

00:39:52.340 --> 00:39:57.580
"If I may give an opinion," remarked the strange
gentleman,

00:39:57.580 --> 00:40:01.250
"we've had just a little too much secrecy
over this business

00:40:01.250 --> 00:40:02.670
already.

00:40:02.670 --> 00:40:05.550
For my part, I should like all Europe and
America to

00:40:05.550 --> 00:40:08.090
hear the rights of it."

00:40:08.090 --> 00:40:13.520
He was a small, wiry, sunburnt man,
clean-shaven, with a sharp face and alert

00:40:13.520 --> 00:40:14.520
manner.

00:40:14.520 --> 00:40:18.900
"Then I'll tell our story right away," said
the lady.

00:40:18.900 --> 00:40:22.770
"Frank here
and I met in '84, in McQuire's camp, near

00:40:22.770 --> 00:40:26.110
the Rockies, where pa
was working a claim.

00:40:26.110 --> 00:40:31.230
We were engaged to each other, Frank and I;
but then one day father struck a rich pocket

00:40:31.230 --> 00:40:34.990
and made a pile,
while poor Frank here had a claim that petered

00:40:34.990 --> 00:40:37.010
out and came to
nothing.

00:40:37.010 --> 00:40:40.380
The richer pa grew the poorer was Frank; so
at last pa

00:40:40.380 --> 00:40:44.080
wouldn't hear of our engagement lasting any
longer, and he took

00:40:44.080 --> 00:40:46.230
me away to 'Frisco.

00:40:46.230 --> 00:40:48.201
Frank wouldn't throw up his hand, though;
so

00:40:48.201 --> 00:40:51.430
he followed me there, and he saw me without
pa knowing anything

00:40:51.430 --> 00:40:52.650
about it.

00:40:52.650 --> 00:40:54.980
It would only have made him mad to know, so
we just

00:40:54.980 --> 00:40:57.810
fixed it all up for ourselves.

00:40:57.810 --> 00:41:01.580
Frank said that he would go and
make his pile, too, and never come back to

00:41:01.580 --> 00:41:04.690
claim me until he had
as much as pa.

00:41:04.690 --> 00:41:07.020
So then I promised to wait for him to the
end of

00:41:07.020 --> 00:41:11.850
time and pledged myself not to marry anyone
else while he lived.

00:41:11.850 --> 00:41:15.590
'Why shouldn't we be married right away, then,'
said he, 'and

00:41:15.590 --> 00:41:18.510
then I will feel sure of you; and I won't
claim to be your

00:41:18.510 --> 00:41:20.619
husband until I come back?'

00:41:20.619 --> 00:41:26.230
Well, we talked it over, and he had
fixed it all up so nicely, with a clergyman

00:41:26.230 --> 00:41:30.310
all ready in waiting,
that we just did it right there; and then

00:41:30.310 --> 00:41:34.020
Frank went off to seek
his fortune, and I went back to pa.

00:41:34.020 --> 00:41:37.980
"The next I heard of Frank was that he was
in Montana, and then

00:41:37.980 --> 00:41:41.700
he went prospecting in Arizona, and then I
heard of him from New

00:41:41.700 --> 00:41:43.160
Mexico.

00:41:43.160 --> 00:41:45.720
After that came a long newspaper story about
how a

00:41:45.720 --> 00:41:49.580
miners' camp had been attacked by Apache Indians,
and there was

00:41:49.580 --> 00:41:51.970
my Frank's name among the killed.

00:41:51.970 --> 00:41:56.720
I fainted dead away, and I was
very sick for months after.

00:41:56.720 --> 00:42:01.260
Pa thought I had a decline and took
me to half the doctors in 'Frisco.

00:42:01.260 --> 00:42:05.150
Not a word of news came for a
year and more, so that I never doubted that

00:42:05.150 --> 00:42:07.370
Frank was really
dead.

00:42:07.370 --> 00:42:11.030
Then Lord St. Simon came to 'Frisco, and we
came to London,

00:42:11.030 --> 00:42:15.460
and a marriage was arranged, and pa was very
pleased, but I felt

00:42:15.460 --> 00:42:19.010
all the time that no man on this earth would
ever take the place

00:42:19.010 --> 00:42:22.320
in my heart that had been given to my poor
Frank.

00:42:22.320 --> 00:42:26.590
"Still, if I had married Lord St. Simon, of
course I'd have done

00:42:26.590 --> 00:42:28.250
my duty by him.

00:42:28.250 --> 00:42:31.610
We can't command our love, but we can our
actions.

00:42:31.610 --> 00:42:34.060
I went to the altar with him with the intention
to make

00:42:34.060 --> 00:42:37.560
him just as good a wife as it was in me to
be.

00:42:37.560 --> 00:42:41.420
But you may
imagine what I felt when, just as I came to

00:42:41.420 --> 00:42:45.580
the altar rails, I
glanced back and saw Frank standing and looking

00:42:45.580 --> 00:42:48.070
at me out of the
first pew.

00:42:48.070 --> 00:42:51.490
I thought it was his ghost at first; but when
I looked

00:42:51.490 --> 00:42:56.310
again there he was still, with a kind of question
in his eyes, as

00:42:56.310 --> 00:42:59.890
if to ask me whether I were glad or sorry
to see him.

00:42:59.890 --> 00:43:02.340
I wonder I
didn't drop.

00:43:02.340 --> 00:43:04.790
I know that everything was turning round,
and the

00:43:04.790 --> 00:43:08.510
words of the clergyman were just like the
buzz of a bee in my

00:43:08.510 --> 00:43:09.510
ear.

00:43:09.510 --> 00:43:11.090
I didn't know what to do.

00:43:11.090 --> 00:43:13.640
Should I stop the service and make
a scene in the church?

00:43:13.640 --> 00:43:18.630
I glanced at him again, and he seemed to
know what I was thinking, for he raised his

00:43:18.630 --> 00:43:21.869
finger to his lips to
tell me to be still.

00:43:21.869 --> 00:43:27.640
Then I saw him scribble on a piece of paper,
and I knew that he was writing me a note.

00:43:27.640 --> 00:43:31.340
As I passed his pew on
the way out I dropped my bouquet over to him,

00:43:31.340 --> 00:43:34.380
and he slipped the
note into my hand when he returned me the

00:43:34.380 --> 00:43:35.880
flowers.

00:43:35.880 --> 00:43:39.160
It was only a
line asking me to join him when he made the

00:43:39.160 --> 00:43:40.980
sign to me to do so.

00:43:40.980 --> 00:43:44.220
Of course I never doubted for a moment that
my first duty was now

00:43:44.220 --> 00:43:48.530
to him, and I determined to do just whatever
he might direct.

00:43:48.530 --> 00:43:52.859
"When I got back I told my maid, who had known
him in California,

00:43:52.859 --> 00:43:55.040
and had always been his friend.

00:43:55.040 --> 00:43:59.660
I ordered her to say nothing, but
to get a few things packed and my ulster ready.

00:43:59.660 --> 00:44:03.460
I know I ought to
have spoken to Lord St. Simon, but it was

00:44:03.460 --> 00:44:07.210
dreadful hard before
his mother and all those great people.

00:44:07.210 --> 00:44:11.109
I just made up my mind to
run away and explain afterwards.

00:44:11.109 --> 00:44:14.850
I hadn't been at the table ten
minutes before I saw Frank out of the window

00:44:14.850 --> 00:44:17.190
at the other side of
the road.

00:44:17.190 --> 00:44:20.610
He beckoned to me and then began walking into
the Park.

00:44:20.610 --> 00:44:24.780
I slipped out, put on my things, and followed
him.

00:44:24.780 --> 00:44:27.410
Some woman
came talking something or other about Lord

00:44:27.410 --> 00:44:30.580
St. Simon to
me--seemed to me from the little I heard as

00:44:30.580 --> 00:44:34.599
if he had a little
secret of his own before marriage also--but

00:44:34.599 --> 00:44:38.520
I managed to get away
from her and soon overtook Frank.

00:44:38.520 --> 00:44:42.840
We got into a cab together, and
away we drove to some lodgings he had taken

00:44:42.840 --> 00:44:47.450
in Gordon Square, and
that was my true wedding after all those years

00:44:47.450 --> 00:44:48.940
of waiting.

00:44:48.940 --> 00:44:51.480
Frank
had been a prisoner among the Apaches, had

00:44:51.480 --> 00:44:55.230
escaped, came on to
'Frisco, found that I had given him up for

00:44:55.230 --> 00:44:59.680
dead and had gone to
England, followed me there, and had come upon

00:44:59.680 --> 00:45:03.330
me at last on the
very morning of my second wedding."

00:45:03.330 --> 00:45:07.110
"I saw it in a paper," explained the American.

00:45:07.110 --> 00:45:11.119
"It gave the name
and the church but not where the lady lived."

00:45:11.119 --> 00:45:16.099
"Then we had a talk as to what we should do,
and Frank was all

00:45:16.099 --> 00:45:20.170
for openness, but I was so ashamed of it all
that I felt as if I

00:45:20.170 --> 00:45:23.890
should like to vanish away and never see any
of them again--just

00:45:23.890 --> 00:45:27.690
sending a line to pa, perhaps, to show him
that I was alive.

00:45:27.690 --> 00:45:29.700
It
was awful to me to think of all those lords

00:45:29.700 --> 00:45:32.640
and ladies sitting
round that breakfast-table and waiting for

00:45:32.640 --> 00:45:33.890
me to come back.

00:45:33.890 --> 00:45:36.411
So
Frank took my wedding-clothes and things and

00:45:36.411 --> 00:45:39.710
made a bundle of
them, so that I should not be traced, and

00:45:39.710 --> 00:45:42.330
dropped them away
somewhere where no one could find them.

00:45:42.330 --> 00:45:46.510
It is likely that we
should have gone on to Paris to-morrow, only

00:45:46.510 --> 00:45:49.930
that this good
gentleman, Mr. Holmes, came round to us this

00:45:49.930 --> 00:45:53.910
evening, though how
he found us is more than I can think, and

00:45:53.910 --> 00:45:57.560
he showed us very
clearly and kindly that I was wrong and that

00:45:57.560 --> 00:46:00.510
Frank was right, and
that we should be putting ourselves in the

00:46:00.510 --> 00:46:03.030
wrong if we were so
secret.

00:46:03.030 --> 00:46:05.560
Then he offered to give us a chance of talking
to Lord

00:46:05.560 --> 00:46:09.880
St. Simon alone, and so we came right away
round to his rooms at

00:46:09.880 --> 00:46:10.880
once.

00:46:10.880 --> 00:46:14.930
Now, Robert, you have heard it all, and I
am very sorry if

00:46:14.930 --> 00:46:18.320
I have given you pain, and I hope that you
do not think very

00:46:18.320 --> 00:46:20.970
meanly of me."

00:46:20.970 --> 00:46:25.061
Lord St. Simon had by no means relaxed his
rigid attitude, but

00:46:25.061 --> 00:46:28.050
had listened with a frowning brow and a compressed
lip to this

00:46:28.050 --> 00:46:29.700
long narrative.

00:46:29.700 --> 00:46:35.710
"Excuse me," he said, "but it is not my custom
to discuss my most

00:46:35.710 --> 00:46:38.500
intimate personal affairs in this public manner."

00:46:38.500 --> 00:46:41.500
"Then you won't forgive me?

00:46:41.500 --> 00:46:43.980
You won't shake hands before I go?"

00:46:43.980 --> 00:46:48.970
"Oh, certainly, if it would give you any pleasure."

00:46:48.970 --> 00:46:52.109
He put out
his hand and coldly grasped that which she

00:46:52.109 --> 00:46:53.980
extended to him.

00:46:53.980 --> 00:46:58.390
"I had hoped," suggested Holmes, "that you
would have joined us

00:46:58.390 --> 00:46:59.450
in a friendly supper."

00:46:59.450 --> 00:47:06.109
"I think that there you ask a little too much,"
responded his

00:47:06.109 --> 00:47:07.109
Lordship.

00:47:07.109 --> 00:47:12.350
"I may be forced to `acquiesce` in these recent
developments, but I can hardly be expected

00:47:12.350 --> 00:47:14.640
to make merry over
them.

00:47:14.640 --> 00:47:18.000
I think that with your permission I will now
wish you all a

00:47:18.000 --> 00:47:20.190
very good-night."

00:47:20.190 --> 00:47:24.839
He included us all in a sweeping bow and
stalked out of the room.

00:47:24.839 --> 00:47:28.000
"Then I trust that you at least will honour
me with your

00:47:28.000 --> 00:47:30.270
company," said Sherlock Holmes.

00:47:30.270 --> 00:47:35.260
"It is always a joy to meet an
American, Mr. Moulton, for I am one of those

00:47:35.260 --> 00:47:38.330
who believe that the
folly of a monarch and the blundering of a

00:47:38.330 --> 00:47:42.500
minister in far-gone
years will not prevent our children from being

00:47:42.500 --> 00:47:47.030
some day citizens
of the same world-wide country under a flag

00:47:47.030 --> 00:47:50.150
which shall be a
quartering of the Union Jack with the Stars

00:47:50.150 --> 00:47:51.150
and Stripes."

00:47:51.150 --> 00:47:57.680
"The case has been an interesting one," remarked
Holmes when our

00:47:57.680 --> 00:48:01.830
visitors had left us, "because it serves to
show very clearly how

00:48:01.830 --> 00:48:05.670
simple the explanation may be of an affair
which at first sight

00:48:05.670 --> 00:48:09.170
seems to be almost inexplicable.

00:48:09.170 --> 00:48:12.470
Nothing could be more natural
than the sequence of events as narrated by

00:48:12.470 --> 00:48:16.291
this lady, and nothing
stranger than the result when viewed, for

00:48:16.291 --> 00:48:19.140
instance, by Mr.
Lestrade of Scotland Yard."

00:48:19.140 --> 00:48:23.540
"You were not yourself at fault at all, then?"

00:48:23.540 --> 00:48:27.910
"From the first, two facts were very obvious
to me, the one that

00:48:27.910 --> 00:48:31.650
the lady had been quite willing to undergo
the wedding ceremony,

00:48:31.650 --> 00:48:34.570
the other that she had repented of it within
a few minutes of

00:48:34.570 --> 00:48:36.650
returning home.

00:48:36.650 --> 00:48:40.700
Obviously something had occurred during the
morning, then, to cause her to change her

00:48:40.700 --> 00:48:41.940
mind.

00:48:41.940 --> 00:48:43.960
What could that
something be?

00:48:43.960 --> 00:48:46.250
She could not have spoken to anyone when she
was

00:48:46.250 --> 00:48:50.150
out, for she had been in the company of the
bridegroom.

00:48:50.150 --> 00:48:52.380
Had she
seen someone, then?

00:48:52.380 --> 00:48:57.540
If she had, it must be someone from America
because she had spent so short a time in this

00:48:57.540 --> 00:49:00.940
country that she
could hardly have allowed anyone to acquire

00:49:00.940 --> 00:49:04.880
so deep an influence
over her that the mere sight of him would

00:49:04.880 --> 00:49:08.540
induce her to change
her plans so completely.

00:49:08.540 --> 00:49:13.830
You see we have already arrived, by a
process of exclusion, at the idea that she

00:49:13.830 --> 00:49:16.380
might have seen an
American.

00:49:16.380 --> 00:49:19.160
Then who could this American be, and why should
he

00:49:19.160 --> 00:49:22.260
possess so much influence over her?

00:49:22.260 --> 00:49:25.710
It might be a lover; it might
be a husband.

00:49:25.710 --> 00:49:28.510
Her young womanhood had, I knew, been spent
in

00:49:28.510 --> 00:49:31.740
rough scenes and under strange conditions.

00:49:31.740 --> 00:49:36.570
So far I had got
before I ever heard Lord St. Simon's narrative.

00:49:36.570 --> 00:49:40.500
When he told us
of a man in a pew, of the change in the bride's

00:49:40.500 --> 00:49:44.420
manner, of so
transparent a device for obtaining a note

00:49:44.420 --> 00:49:48.890
as the dropping of a
bouquet, of her resort to her confidential

00:49:48.890 --> 00:49:53.560
maid, and of her very
significant allusion to claim-jumping--which

00:49:53.560 --> 00:49:57.200
in miners' parlance
means taking possession of that which another

00:49:57.200 --> 00:50:02.869
person has a prior
claim to--the whole situation became absolutely

00:50:02.869 --> 00:50:03.869
clear.

00:50:03.869 --> 00:50:06.720
She had
gone off with a man, and the man was either

00:50:06.720 --> 00:50:10.839
a lover or was a
previous husband--the chances being in favour

00:50:10.839 --> 00:50:12.380
of the latter."

00:50:12.380 --> 00:50:15.690
"And how in the world did you find them?"

00:50:15.690 --> 00:50:19.230
"It might have been difficult, but friend
Lestrade held

00:50:19.230 --> 00:50:23.349
information in his hands the value of which
he did not himself

00:50:23.349 --> 00:50:24.450
know.

00:50:24.450 --> 00:50:27.700
The initials were, of course, of the highest
importance,

00:50:27.700 --> 00:50:31.410
but more valuable still was it to know that
within a week he had

00:50:31.410 --> 00:50:35.270
settled his bill at one of the most select
London hotels."

00:50:35.270 --> 00:50:38.290
"How did you deduce the select?"

00:50:38.290 --> 00:50:40.380
"By the select prices.

00:50:40.380 --> 00:50:45.220
Eight shillings for a bed and eightpence
for a glass of sherry pointed to one of the

00:50:45.220 --> 00:50:47.610
most expensive
hotels.

00:50:47.610 --> 00:50:51.060
There are not many in London which charge
at that rate.

00:50:51.060 --> 00:50:55.000
In the second one which I visited in Northumberland
Avenue, I

00:50:55.000 --> 00:50:59.540
learned by an inspection of the book that
Francis H. Moulton, an

00:50:59.540 --> 00:51:03.910
American gentleman, had left only the day
before, and on looking

00:51:03.910 --> 00:51:07.870
over the entries against him, I came upon
the very items which I

00:51:07.870 --> 00:51:10.490
had seen in the duplicate bill.

00:51:10.490 --> 00:51:17.170
His letters were to be forwarded
to 226 Gordon Square; so thither I travelled,

00:51:17.170 --> 00:51:20.570
and being fortunate
enough to find the loving couple at home,

00:51:20.570 --> 00:51:25.180
I ventured to give them
some paternal advice and to point out to them

00:51:25.180 --> 00:51:28.250
that it would be
better in every way that they should make

00:51:28.250 --> 00:51:32.220
their position a little
clearer both to the general public and to

00:51:32.220 --> 00:51:35.070
Lord St. Simon in
particular.

00:51:35.070 --> 00:51:38.990
I invited them to meet him here, and, as you
see, I

00:51:38.990 --> 00:51:40.270
made him keep the appointment."

00:51:40.270 --> 00:51:44.790
"But with no very good result," I remarked.

00:51:44.790 --> 00:51:47.950
"His conduct was
certainly not very gracious."

00:51:47.950 --> 00:51:53.080
"Ah, Watson," said Holmes, smiling, "perhaps
you would not be

00:51:53.080 --> 00:51:57.630
very gracious either, if, after all the trouble
of wooing and

00:51:57.630 --> 00:52:01.990
wedding, you found yourself deprived in an
instant of wife and of

00:52:01.990 --> 00:52:02.990
fortune.

00:52:02.990 --> 00:52:06.480
I think that we may judge Lord St. Simon very
mercifully

00:52:06.480 --> 00:52:10.369
and thank our stars that we are never likely
to find ourselves in

00:52:10.369 --> 00:52:12.830
the same position.

00:52:12.830 --> 00:52:15.920
Draw your chair up and hand me my violin,
for

00:52:15.920 --> 00:52:19.660
the only problem we have still to solve is
how to while away
