ISIS and the U.S. Presidential Election

WEBVTT Kind: captions Language: en 

The self-proclaimed Islamic State dramatically rose from obscurity in 2014 when it split from al-Qaeda, seized territory in Iraq and Syria, and established what it describes as a caliphate governed by strict sharia law. The Islamic State views non-Muslims and any Muslim who does not accept its rule as enemies. It has recruited foreign fighters from around the world, and inspired pledges of allegiance by jihadist groups from Libya to Pakistan to Nigeria. The group is fighting against all other factions in the ongoing civil war in Syria, which has displaced half the country’s population causing a refugee crisis in the region and in Europe. The United States is concerned about the Islamic State’s control of territory and population in the heart of the Middle East, and about its ability to both carry out attacks and inspire them elsewhere in the world, including in the U.S. homeland. The United States is already taking some steps to roll back the Islamic State and restrict its resources and recruits, including airstrikes, arming and training local partners, and dispatching military advisors and special operations forces. The next president will face tough decisions in confronting the Islamic State: 

Troops on the ground -- There is an ongoing debate about whether the United States should commit significant ground forces against the Islamic State. The worry is that it may lead to another `protracted` and costly military engagement in the Middle East, with no clear exit strategy. Arming the Kurds -- In both Iraq and Syria, Kurdish forces have been the most effective local partners against the Islamic State. But greater support for Syrian Kurds presents a `dilemma` because Turkey -- a NATO ally -- considers them as terrorists. And greater support for Iraqi Kurds may increase the likelihood of an independent Kurdish state – which Iraq, Turkey, Syria, and Iran oppose. The next president will have to decide how much to support Kurdish forces. 

What about Assad? – The fight against the Islamic State is intertwined with the civil war in Syria. As long as President Bashar al-Assad remains in power it inspires support for the Islamic State. But Assad is backed by Russia and Iran, and influential countries are deeply divided on whether and when to press for his departure. The president will have to decide what negotiated solution the United States is prepared to live with, and whether to provide greater military support for local Sunni partners who seek to `oust` Assad. The battle against the Islamic State will have to be calibrated with a host of interconnected regional challenges, including the sectarian strif e in Iraq, spillover into neighboring Turkey, Kurdish desires for independence, tensions between Iran and Saudi Arabia, and Russia’s renewed `assertiveness`. The next president will have to make decisions that will affect U.S. policy not just in the Middle East but around the world.
