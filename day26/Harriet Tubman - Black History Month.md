00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:13.246
VO: The Underground Railroad was
a secret network of routes

00:00:13.246 --> 00:00:15.580
and safe houses that helped
people escape slavery

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:19.246
to settle in Canada as well as
in some free Northern states.

00:00:19.746 --> 00:00:21.913
Some believe that secret
messages in the form of

00:00:21.913 --> 00:00:25.246
quilt patterns helped enslaved
African men and women

00:00:25.246 --> 00:00:28.246
escape the bonds of captivity
in the Southern states.

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:31.746
Likewise, it is believed
that singing gospel songs

00:00:31.746 --> 00:00:33.746
was a means to communicate
among slaves who

00:00:33.746 --> 00:00:36.113
travelled the
Underground Railroad.

00:00:36.113 --> 00:00:39.146
The lyrics provided verbal,
coded communication that

00:00:39.146 --> 00:00:42.080
uncovered hidden messages and
warnings about their travels.

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:52.380
♪

00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:55.580
The bold, selfless acts of
one determined individual

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:59.380
contributed to the freedom
of many: Harriet Tubman.

00:00:59.380 --> 00:01:02.013
"The Black Moses" as
she was often called,

00:01:02.013 --> 00:01:04.346
is well known for leading
many enslaved people to

00:01:04.346 --> 00:01:07.580
freedom in Canada by
following the North Star.

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:11.580
She made countless journeys
and never once lost a passenger.

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:14.580
Tubman, a runaway slave from
Maryland, was determined

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:17.580
to abolish the misery and
suffering of her people.

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:20.580
Rosemary: Before achieving fame
as a conductor on the

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:25.113
Underground Railroad, Tubman
was an enslaved African woman.

00:01:25.113 --> 00:01:27.580
She felt like she almost
was actually free

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:30.913
as she toiled with little
supervision while felling trees

00:01:30.913 --> 00:01:33.180
and cutting up
lumber in Maryland.

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:35.213
Once, while in the fields,

00:01:35.213 --> 00:01:38.346
she saw someone trying to
escape and got involved.

00:01:38.346 --> 00:01:39.913
She was injured and in turn,

00:01:39.913 --> 00:01:43.913
became more steadfast in
her wish to be free.

00:01:43.913 --> 00:01:45.746
Tubman was the youngest
of her family

00:01:45.746 --> 00:01:47.913
and worked with them
in the fields.

00:01:47.913 --> 00:01:50.413
When she married and
discovered her husband was

00:01:50.413 --> 00:01:55.080
not willing to head north
with her, she set out alone.

00:01:55.913 --> 00:01:57.746
VO: She then ventured
to Philadelphia

00:01:57.746 --> 00:02:00.080
where she associated
with abolitionists and

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:02.746
learned about the connections
of the Underground Railroad.

00:02:04.246 --> 00:02:06.413
When the `far-reaching`
United States Fugitive Law

00:02:06.413 --> 00:02:08.013
was passed in 1850,

00:02:08.013 --> 00:02:11.080
Harriet Tubman guided fugitive
enslaved African men and women

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:12.580
into Canada.

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:15.413
Angry slave owners posted
rewards for her capture,

00:02:15.413 --> 00:02:18.746
but she continued her work
despite great personal risk.

00:02:18.913 --> 00:02:21.580
Tough and courageous, in
spite of her petite frame;

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:23.913
she always carried a
weapon intimidating those

00:02:23.913 --> 00:02:27.046
who supported slavery, and
discouraging enslaved people

00:02:27.046 --> 00:02:29.246
from backing out of the
strenuous journey.

00:02:29.246 --> 00:02:31.913
She threatened anyone who
considered turning back,

00:02:31.913 --> 00:02:33.913
knowing the danger
of those involved:

00:02:33.913 --> 00:02:36.913
revealing the routes and
safe house locations.

00:02:37.113 --> 00:02:40.080
Rosemary: As the conductor,
Tubman had the problem of

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:42.746
keeping people motivated and
together as they travelled

00:02:42.746 --> 00:02:44.746
by night and hid by day.

00:02:44.746 --> 00:02:47.913
Because Tubman was so
successful at organizing these

00:02:47.913 --> 00:02:51.480
group escapes, slave owners
offered high rewards

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:52.913
for her capture.

00:02:52.913 --> 00:02:56.913
She is thought to have led as
many as 19 rescue missions.

00:02:57.413 --> 00:03:00.413
While the possibility of
torture or death or being

00:03:00.413 --> 00:03:03.913
resold into the deep south
always existed, it was the

00:03:03.913 --> 00:03:07.580
loss of family members
that Tubman feared most.

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:10.913
She made a point of rescuing
all of her family,

00:03:10.913 --> 00:03:14.913
settling them in both Ontario
and later New York State.

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:18.580
She gave her life to
making people free.

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:22.046
VO: St. Catharines Ontario
was one of the towns

00:03:22.046 --> 00:03:24.413
in which Harriet passed
through on her journeys.

00:03:24.413 --> 00:03:26.313
The town offered
employment opportunities

00:03:26.313 --> 00:03:28.246
to the escaped enslaved
people.

00:03:28.246 --> 00:03:30.580
Many of the former
fugitives settled there,

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:32.913
including her own parents,
brothers, sisters

00:03:32.913 --> 00:03:34.580
and their families.

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:39.746
Harriet Tubman lived in St.
Catharines from 1851 to 1857.

00:03:39.746 --> 00:03:42.413
Harriet's role in the
Underground Railroad movement

00:03:42.413 --> 00:03:45.580
was one of the many inspiring
accomplishments of her life.

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:48.280
She was an activist in the
abolitionist movement,

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:50.246
worked as a nurse in
the Civil War, and

00:03:50.246 --> 00:03:53.913
served as a spy for the Union
Forces in South Carolina.

00:03:54.413 --> 00:03:56.180
Rosemary: The need for the
Underground Railroad

00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:58.580
ended after the
American Civil War.

00:03:58.580 --> 00:04:00.580
Tubman had been actively
involved with the

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:03.913
northern forces as a
nurse, spy and cook.

00:04:03.913 --> 00:04:07.513
She supported suffrage and
founded a home for the homeless

00:04:07.513 --> 00:04:12.580
before she passed away
in 1913 at the age of 93.
