00:00:10.079 --> 00:00:12.628
Let me ask you a question:

00:00:12.629 --> 00:00:15.368
how many of you would hire a felon,

00:00:15.369 --> 00:00:18.038
a recovering addict?

00:00:18.039 --> 00:00:21.728
How about someone who's never had
a job longer than a year?

00:00:21.729 --> 00:00:25.859
I see some hands,
but my guess is not many of you.

00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:29.009
Why would you?
You have a business to protect.

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:31.078
Before I began working at my current job,

00:00:31.079 --> 00:00:33.909
I wouldn't have hired
addicts or felons either.

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:37.218
I spent 15 years working in marketing
and business development

00:00:37.219 --> 00:00:38.919
in the private sector.

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:40.189
And in those roles,

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:44.919
I was always focused on hiring
the best, most trustworthy candidates,

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:48.679
but today, I work at a place
called Women's Bean Project.

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:52.349
We hire women with felonies,
often several to their name,

00:00:52.359 --> 00:00:54.678
with long histories of addiction,

00:00:54.679 --> 00:00:58.399
and who haven't had a job
longer than a year in their lifetime.

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:01.279
Their average age is 38.

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:05.409
One might say we hire
the worst workers rather than the best.

00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:08.598
Women's Bean Project has
two manufacturing businesses:

00:01:08.599 --> 00:01:12.878
one makes gourmet food products,
the other handmade jewelry.

00:01:12.879 --> 00:01:15.925
But the products aren't
what's important about our business.

00:01:15.926 --> 00:01:19.659
What's important about
our business is the women.

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:22.788
We hire women who need
to learn workplace norms

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:26.868
like coming to work every day and on time.

00:01:26.869 --> 00:01:29.158
We hire women
who need to learn life skills

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:33.639
like problem solving,
goal-setting, and budgeting.

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:35.509
After nine months, they move

00:01:35.509 --> 00:01:38.319
to a career entry level job
in the community

00:01:38.319 --> 00:01:40.559
where they can advance, prosper,

00:01:40.559 --> 00:01:43.869
and often feel valued
for the first time in their lives.

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:50.058
Before I came to The Bean Project,
I didn't think hiring felons, addicts,

00:01:50.059 --> 00:01:54.008
recovering addicts, and chronically
unemployed was a good idea.

00:01:54.009 --> 00:01:58.219
I thought felons were bad people
who made even worse decisions.

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:03.039
I didn't understand the power of addiction
and how it can affect one's actions.

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:05.509
And I thought women
who are chronically unemployed

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:07.558
didn't want to change their lives.

00:02:07.559 --> 00:02:11.120
Because of these beliefs
I would have never hired Joy.

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:14.819
Joy grew up...

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:19.039
Well, first of all, Joy has
a lovely brown skin, cat shaped eyes,

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:22.858
beautifully arched eyebrows,
and a broad grin.

00:02:22.859 --> 00:02:25.448
She grew up the youngest child
of two drug addicts

00:02:25.449 --> 00:02:28.438
with no role models for employment.

00:02:28.439 --> 00:02:30.718
When she was 12, she began selling crack

00:02:30.719 --> 00:02:34.209
to her parents and their friends
in order to be closer to them.

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:37.929
When she was 16, she began
using crack for the same reason,

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:40.329
and by the time she was 18,
she was a mother

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:45.211
which only amplified her need to sell
crack to support herself and her son.

00:02:45.212 --> 00:02:48.758
For years, through the birth
of three more children,

00:02:48.759 --> 00:02:52.519
Joy continued to sell drugs on her own,

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:54.908
despite multiple arrests on probation,

00:02:54.909 --> 00:02:57.879
until finally, she got hooked up
with big time drug dealers,

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:01.169
and she thought
she had it made, financially speaking.

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:04.668
And then, she was arrested
and convicted on federal drug charges

00:03:04.669 --> 00:03:08.608
and sentenced to 54 months in prison.

00:03:08.609 --> 00:03:12.750
Well, there are no federal women's prisons
in Colorado, so she was sent out of state

00:03:12.759 --> 00:03:16.318
leaving her four kids to await her return.

00:03:16.319 --> 00:03:19.188
Now, if all I've done was read about Joy,

00:03:19.189 --> 00:03:23.799
I would have thought she was tough,
and conniving, and not very trustworthy,

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:26.799
but Joy wasn't anything like that.

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:30.639
She was soft-spoken, and kind,
and enormously grateful

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:33.500
for all the help she received
while at The Bean Project.

00:03:34.421 --> 00:03:38.239
She worked hard, and she learned
to stand up for herself,

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:40.569
something she'd never done before.

00:03:41.919 --> 00:03:45.208
We believe that Joy could create
a new life for herself.

00:03:45.209 --> 00:03:50.169
One that didn't involve selling drugs
and eventually, she believed it, too.

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:53.468
Today, Joy is enrolled in college

00:03:53.469 --> 00:03:58.198
and works for a food distributor
making over 17 dollars an hour.

00:03:58.199 --> 00:04:02.279
All four kids ranging in age
from 8 to 18 live with her,

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:05.369
and she is focused
on keeping them in school

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:09.169
and helping them avoid
making the same mistake she made.

00:04:10.469 --> 00:04:11.949
(Applause)

00:04:18.428 --> 00:04:22.128
Joy taught me that no matter
how rough one's exterior,

00:04:22.129 --> 00:04:28.069
there's often still a spirit within
that wants to change and pay her own way.

00:04:28.079 --> 00:04:30.859
She taught me
that if she'd had another choice,

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:33.333
if someone had actually believed in her,

00:04:33.334 --> 00:04:36.809
she'd have never chosen
to be a desperate drug dealer.

00:04:38.879 --> 00:04:42.278
I wouldn't have hired Joy, and I certainly
wouldn't have hired Selena

00:04:42.279 --> 00:04:46.568
who is only 21 when she began
working at The Bean Project.

00:04:46.569 --> 00:04:50.509
Selena arrived with her golden blonde hair
flowing smoothly down her back

00:04:50.510 --> 00:04:53.188
and an anxious expression.

00:04:53.189 --> 00:04:56.459
Her clear blue eyes implied innocence,
but once I heard her story

00:04:56.460 --> 00:04:59.479
I knew that innocence had long been lost.

00:04:59.480 --> 00:05:03.249
When Selena was 12, her mum
introduced her to cocaine.

00:05:03.250 --> 00:05:07.919
At 13, Selena became homeless,
when her mom kicked her out of the house

00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:11.738
because she perceived Selena
was competition for boyfriends.

00:05:11.739 --> 00:05:15.599
With the street as her home,
Selena was forced to drop out of school.

00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:17.818
And she wasn't old enough to work,

00:05:17.819 --> 00:05:20.709
so she wandered
with no purpose or responsibility,

00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:25.399
but she had drugs which she got
through any means necessary.

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:31.228
For the next five years, Selena lived
a life of violence and addiction

00:05:31.229 --> 00:05:36.389
until finally, she was poisoned,
robbed, and held up at gunpoint,

00:05:36.390 --> 00:05:38.359
- and even threatened others with guns -

00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:40.919
until finally, the nightmare ended,

00:05:40.920 --> 00:05:45.880
and she was arrested for manufacturing
and attempt to distribute drugs.

00:05:47.319 --> 00:05:48.909
She spent the next three years

00:05:48.910 --> 00:05:52.159
working her way through
the Department of Corrections.

00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:55.240
And then, her pastor,
the one adult she could trust,

00:05:55.241 --> 00:05:57.758
referred her to The Bean Project.

00:05:57.759 --> 00:06:00.939
Now, you might think Selena
would have a hard time following rules

00:06:00.940 --> 00:06:03.799
having lived on the streets
during her formative years.

00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:06.368
And you might also think
that she'd have a hard time

00:06:06.369 --> 00:06:08.978
remaining clean and sober
because she had never learned

00:06:08.979 --> 00:06:12.648
to manage her emotions
without using drugs and alcohol,

00:06:12.649 --> 00:06:15.978
but Selena was hungry
for a new opportunity,

00:06:15.979 --> 00:06:18.758
eager to please and succeed.

00:06:18.759 --> 00:06:21.359
We provided Selena
with that new opportunity,

00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:25.849
we believed she could create a new life,
and that she deserved a second chance.

00:06:25.850 --> 00:06:28.988
And eventually, she believed it, too.

00:06:28.989 --> 00:06:32.059
Selena got a job at Safeway
where she learned to count change.

00:06:32.060 --> 00:06:34.289
And then she enrolled
in an adult high school

00:06:34.290 --> 00:06:37.149
to begin to address
her third grade reading level.

00:06:37.989 --> 00:06:41.068
Today, Selena is married, owns a home,

00:06:41.069 --> 00:06:44.729
and works for a local business
in South Dakota where she resides.

00:06:44.730 --> 00:06:46.900
(Applause)

00:06:51.480 --> 00:06:56.199
Selena taught me that even a young woman
with no reason to trust

00:06:56.200 --> 00:07:01.158
can make herself vulnerable enough
to receive help and change her life.

00:07:01.159 --> 00:07:04.900
Selena, like so many of us,
just needed someone to believe in her.

00:07:06.680 --> 00:07:09.079
Before I became CEO
of Women's Bean Project,

00:07:09.080 --> 00:07:13.338
I was in the business world: profitability
and efficiency, return on investment;

00:07:13.339 --> 00:07:15.599
those were my watch words.

00:07:15.600 --> 00:07:19.020
In those roles, I would have
never hired Gloria.

00:07:19.990 --> 00:07:26.329
Today, Gloria's brown skin is clear,
her eyes twinkle, and her smile is bright,

00:07:26.330 --> 00:07:28.769
but when she arrived at The Bean Project,

00:07:29.879 --> 00:07:34.829
her brown eyes were flat, her skin
was blotchy, and she was extremely thin.

00:07:36.039 --> 00:07:38.679
Gloria had had a hard time
keeping a long term job

00:07:38.680 --> 00:07:42.218
because she had no belief
in herself or her abilities.

00:07:42.219 --> 00:07:45.499
Her abusive marriage had ended
and her ex had taken their kids

00:07:45.500 --> 00:07:50.769
leaving her with nothing:
no money, no kids, no sense of self.

00:07:50.770 --> 00:07:53.407
After years of closet drinking

00:07:53.408 --> 00:07:56.858
and letting her husband determine
the direction of her life,

00:07:56.859 --> 00:08:00.749
Gloria had to find her way
on her own, alone, and sober.

00:08:00.750 --> 00:08:05.308
The homeless shelter where she was living
referred her to The Bean Project.

00:08:05.309 --> 00:08:09.098
On her first day, when she sat
with our case manager

00:08:09.099 --> 00:08:12.310
broken down and hopeless,
she softly said,

00:08:13.080 --> 00:08:15.939
"I've lost my voice."

00:08:15.940 --> 00:08:19.209
In return, our case manager
looked into her tired eyes,

00:08:19.210 --> 00:08:22.919
and said simply, "I'm listening."

00:08:22.920 --> 00:08:25.479
You see, we believed in Gloria.

00:08:25.480 --> 00:08:28.759
We believe she could create
a new life for herself,

00:08:28.760 --> 00:08:31.579
and eventually, she believed it, too.

00:08:31.580 --> 00:08:35.950
Gloria graduated Women's Bean Project
eleven years ago, when a local business

00:08:35.960 --> 00:08:39.818
took a chance and created
a job for her at their front desk.

00:08:39.820 --> 00:08:42.828
That business has grown,
and Gloria still works there.

00:08:42.830 --> 00:08:47.599
Only now she manages five women,
has just closed on her first home,

00:08:47.600 --> 00:08:50.459
and is on the verge
of earning her college degree.

00:08:50.460 --> 00:08:52.199
(Applause)

00:08:57.899 --> 00:09:01.829
Today, Gloria describes herself
as a communicator, goal setter,

00:09:01.830 --> 00:09:03.450
and fabulous.

00:09:03.451 --> 00:09:04.661
(Laughter)

00:09:05.961 --> 00:09:10.079
Believing in another human being
can create powerful life-changing results.

00:09:10.080 --> 00:09:12.629
Seven out of ten women we hire 
graduate and move

00:09:12.630 --> 00:09:15.468
to career entry level jobs
in the community.

00:09:15.469 --> 00:09:19.408
A year later, 85% of these formerly
chronically unemployed women

00:09:19.409 --> 00:09:21.370
are still employed.

00:09:22.560 --> 00:09:25.199
That means dozens of women
in our community are working,

00:09:25.200 --> 00:09:29.380
supporting their families,
and contributing to society.

00:09:31.159 --> 00:09:34.988
Sure, it's a risk hiring someone
who has been chronically unemployed,

00:09:34.989 --> 00:09:37.719
but as a society we can afford not to.

00:09:37.720 --> 00:09:41.608
The combined cost of a criminal conviction
in just one year of incarceration

00:09:41.609 --> 00:09:44.558
can exceed 70,000 dollars.

00:09:44.559 --> 00:09:45.828
Employment is the key

00:09:45.829 --> 00:09:49.538
to breaking out of poverty
and staying out of prison.

00:09:49.539 --> 00:09:50.858
So you might ask,

00:09:50.859 --> 00:09:55.158
how many women like Joy, Selena,
and Gloria could there possibly be?

00:09:55.159 --> 00:09:56.878
Well, we hire 70 women a year,

00:09:56.879 --> 00:10:01.060
yet, we turn away
four out of five qualified applicants.

00:10:02.679 --> 00:10:05.418
These are women
who are qualified to work for us,

00:10:05.419 --> 00:10:07.989
but we don't have
the capacity to serve them.

00:10:07.990 --> 00:10:12.374
That's 280 women each year
who are unable to change their lives

00:10:12.375 --> 00:10:14.859
because we don't have the capacity,

00:10:14.860 --> 00:10:19.490
and like all businesses, the size
of our workforce is determined by sales.

00:10:21.305 --> 00:10:23.999
Today, I know that when women
come to The Bean Project,

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:25.999
they're not their mistakes.

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:29.078
They're not their felonies or addictions.

00:10:29.079 --> 00:10:32.509
They are mothers, and wives,
and recovering addicts.

00:10:32.510 --> 00:10:36.799
They have been abused, and loved,
and made bad decisions,

00:10:36.800 --> 00:10:39.598
and in their addictions
they were at their worst,

00:10:39.599 --> 00:10:43.089
abandoned, strung out, and hopeless,

00:10:43.090 --> 00:10:46.859
but by the time I meet them,
they're full of possibility.

00:10:47.559 --> 00:10:50.518
What I'm talking about is not just jobs.

00:10:50.519 --> 00:10:53.739
It's about all the other things
that come from gainful employment:

00:10:53.740 --> 00:10:58.658
increased pride and confidence,
the ability to set and work toward goals,

00:10:58.659 --> 00:11:03.538
the opportunity to provide financial
and emotional support to one's family.

00:11:03.539 --> 00:11:06.969
Women like Joy, Selena, and Gloria
are looking for someone

00:11:06.970 --> 00:11:11.500
to see them differently,
support their change, and believe in them.

00:11:13.039 --> 00:11:15.319
I'll leave you with this:

00:11:15.320 --> 00:11:19.029
when you believe in another person,
despite their background,

00:11:19.030 --> 00:11:21.819
despite their best efforts
to self-sabotage,

00:11:21.820 --> 00:11:23.669
despite they're pushing back,

00:11:23.670 --> 00:11:28.569
when you truly believe in them,
they can begin to believe in themselves.

00:11:28.570 --> 00:11:30.379
If we want to change the world,

00:11:30.380 --> 00:11:33.499
we must first believe
in our own ability to change,

00:11:33.500 --> 00:11:36.019
and then believe that others can as well.

00:11:36.020 --> 00:11:37.338
Thank you.

00:11:37.339 --> 00:11:38.980
(Applause)
