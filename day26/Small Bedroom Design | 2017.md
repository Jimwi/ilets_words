00:00:01.300 --> 00:00:07.420
I want to address the room in our home that
often gets left to last, and that is the bedroom,

00:00:07.420 --> 00:00:22.529
and give you some simple, easy ideas to decorate
your small space bedroom.

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:26.749
Tip number one in your small space bedroom
is I kind of say, "Go white."

00:00:26.749 --> 00:00:32.090
When I say, "Go white," I mean sometimes in
paint, I think choosing a warm white really

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:36.769
opens up the space, and I love white in your
bedding, and before you say, "No way.

00:00:36.769 --> 00:00:39.420
I've got dogs, I've got kids, I can't have
white bedding."

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:40.420
You can.

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:41.910
Get two sets if possible.

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:44.180
Change it up and it can be washed.

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:47.820
I have two kids and a dog, and white bedding
is just beautiful.

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:51.829
It opens up the space and makes it appear
larger.

00:00:51.829 --> 00:00:54.530
Tip number two is you want a focal point.

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:57.949
Now everyone talks a lot about focal points,
so I'm going to explain a little bit what

00:00:57.949 --> 00:01:00.340
I mean, especially in a small bedroom.

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:06.340
When you walk into the room, you want something
maybe besides the bed, that catches your attention.

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:12.040
This could be a beautiful light fixture, or
what I've done is put a ginormous painting

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:13.340
above my bed.

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:18.300
The reason I've done this is it really detracts
from the size of the room, that it's small,

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:22.510
and what you see and what you gravitate towards
is that painting.

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:27.630
Try something a little out of the box that
creates that focal point that distracts your

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:28.790
eye.

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:32.430
Tip number three is to use a shelf for your
side table.

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:33.910
Yes, a little shelf.

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:35.750
That's what I've, personally, done.

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:41.610
If you don't have room for a large side table
with drawers and all the rest of it, especially

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:47.070
if you're in a condo or a small space, think
about just a simple shelf.

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:48.830
You can put your glass of water on there.

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:53.630
You can put your book on there, and a great
tip for instead of then having a drawer, which

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:59.060
you're missing, is to put a basket beside
your bed, and that can hold all your extra

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:00.060
stuff.

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:05.460
Tip number four is because you have this shelf,
possibly for your side table, putting a lamp

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:10.479
on there is going to take up a lot of good
real estate, so think about a sconce.

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:15.950
I love all the wall sconces right now, or
an actual `pendant` that hangs from the ceiling

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:18.000
is another beautiful option.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:24.670
It takes up no real estate on your side table,
and it looks really trendy, and really beautiful

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:26.340
in your room.

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:30.670
Tip number five is if you haven't got a bed
already and you're going to invest in a new

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:34.120
one, there are a ton of beds right now with
actual storage.

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:38.450
They have drawers that you can pull out, or
you can pull up the bed, and actually store

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:39.450
things.

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:44.700
This makes a huge difference and putting all
those seasonable items that you don't use.

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:47.870
I hope this has inspired you in decorating
your bedroom.

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:52.560
To help you out, what I've done is included
a freebie of the top five things that every

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:57.790
room needs, and I use to make sure every room
