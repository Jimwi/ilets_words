00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:02.600
Here we are December is
coming to a close and

00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:04.580
we're staring down
the barrel of a new decade.

00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:07.810
But before we pop the champagne and
put on a pair of those dumb glasses.

00:00:07.810 --> 00:00:12.049
Let's take a look back at the past
year and the films we loved in it,

00:00:12.049 --> 00:00:15.698
these are our picks for
the 10 best movies of 2019.

00:00:15.698 --> 00:00:24.911
(Music)

00:00:24.911 --> 00:00:28.777
There were a lot of good movies this year
so we have to break it down by category.

00:00:28.777 --> 00:00:31.256
Let's start big,
this year on the blockbuster front,

00:00:31.256 --> 00:00:33.958
we were most impressed by movies
like John Wick Parabellum.

00:00:33.958 --> 00:00:37.545
Pushing its set pieces to their most
bombastically heightened conclusions.

00:00:37.545 --> 00:00:40.185
In Ford versus Ferrari, it would
have been just a better-than-average

00:00:40.185 --> 00:00:42.705
biopic if it weren't for
the rip roaring driving scenes.

00:00:42.705 --> 00:00:45.940
And don't tell anyone we said this, but
we actually loved Alita: Battle Angel.

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:49.010
And we're sorry it bombed so bad we
likely won't get to see another one.

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:52.010
However, there's nothing quite so
climactic as finishing off a decade with

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:54.850
the capstone to the most
expensive story ever told.

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:57.460
So for our first pick,
we've gotta go with Avengers Endgame.

00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:02.569
&gt;&gt; You know how I keep telling
everybody they should move on and grow.

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:03.534
(Music)

00:01:03.534 --> 00:01:04.240
Some do

00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:08.444
(Music)

00:01:08.444 --> 00:01:09.488
Atlantis.

00:01:09.488 --> 00:01:12.760
&gt;&gt; There is something to be said for
the importance of sticking a landing.

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:15.730
And in the superhero comic book world,
where cheating death is no big deal,

00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:18.970
Endgame stands out by making death and
finality matter.

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:22.410
There is a serious amount of runtime real
estate dedicated to the breath of our

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:24.090
hero's experiences with grief.

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:28.220
And the confrontation for what feels like
the very first time of their own limits.

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:31.950
As the film follows their attempts to
bring back half an entire universe snapped

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:34.030
away, they create a sense of scale.

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:35.270
National mourning, and

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:39.140
cost that elevates End Game beyond
all the previous Marvel offerings.

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:42.640
If you grew up in the Marvel era, Endgame
asked you to stay goodbye to characters

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:44.070
you've know since you were a kid.

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:47.975
And no matter how you feel about comic
book movies and whether they are or

00:01:47.975 --> 00:01:50.264
are not capital C cinema, that matters.

00:01:51.761 --> 00:01:55.350
(Sound) On the other end of the spectrum,
we have our indies.

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:57.310
Telling stories that
feel just as important,

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:00.190
with stakes that are just
a little bit less universal.

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:03.800
This year, we fell most in love with
the raw honesty of The Souvenir,

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:05.960
the subtle vulnerability of Gloria Bell.

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:09.586
The ballsy empathy of Honey Boy,
and for our second pick,

00:02:09.586 --> 00:02:11.889
the endless warmth of The Farewell.

00:02:27.747 --> 00:02:31.225
(Foreign)
&gt;&gt; Farewell is a home-cooked meal with

00:02:31.225 --> 00:02:32.619
grandma in cinematic form.

00:02:32.619 --> 00:02:35.559
Heartfelt, hilarious,
based on an absolutely bonkers

00:02:35.559 --> 00:02:38.389
premise that also just so
happens to be actually real.

00:02:38.389 --> 00:02:41.715
The love is palpable everywhere
in Lulu Wangs breakout picture,

00:02:41.715 --> 00:02:43.775
the story follows Awkwafina as Billie.

00:02:43.775 --> 00:02:46.259
As her and her family head to China for
a wedding,

00:02:46.259 --> 00:02:49.540
it is really just a cover to see
the family matriarch once more.

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:52.360
After she is diagnosed with the cancer
that the family has decided

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:53.610
not to tell her about.

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:56.700
A lesser story with a shoehorned in
a generic romantic side plot and

00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:59.360
a lot more will they,
won't they spill the beans.

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:02.400
But the farewell knows
exactly where its heart is.

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:05.306
Somewhere amidst the marvelous
chemistry between its hero and

00:03:05.306 --> 00:03:07.182
her delightful grandmother, Nai Nai.

00:03:07.182 --> 00:03:09.530
(Music)

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:11.040
What about animation in 2019?

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:14.226
Well this year brought a fourth Toy Story
that we didn't think we wanted but

00:03:14.226 --> 00:03:14.843
totally did.

00:03:14.843 --> 00:03:17.395
A lovely animated Klaus,
rural colonialism,

00:03:17.395 --> 00:03:20.856
and a whimsical stop motion
clothing in this magnificent cake.

00:03:20.856 --> 00:03:25.260
And our absolute favorite,
the delightfully bizarre I l Lost My Body.

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:35.260
(Sound)

00:03:45.147 --> 00:03:47.205
A boy loses his had in I Lost My Body is

00:03:47.205 --> 00:03:49.960
the story of how he puts
himself back together.

00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:54.382
Except, instead of following the boy he
follows his hand crawling its way back to

00:03:54.382 --> 00:03:57.255
him like a five legged flesh crab,
well sometimes.

00:03:57.255 --> 00:03:59.046
Other times it looks like
a tiny little person.

00:03:59.046 --> 00:04:02.043
And somehow you end up feeling for
the strange little bugger, him and

00:04:02.043 --> 00:04:04.073
his owner both, and for
a surprising amount.

00:04:04.073 --> 00:04:07.295
Most films in one way or another
engage with our experience of sight.

00:04:07.295 --> 00:04:10.353
Quite a few engage equally
with our experience of sound.

00:04:10.353 --> 00:04:13.508
But it's a rare film that renders
a sense of touch quite so

00:04:13.508 --> 00:04:15.170
cinematically as done here.

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:16.550
Evoking sense memory so

00:04:16.550 --> 00:04:20.007
powerfully specific that you
can almost them as you watch.

00:04:20.007 --> 00:04:23.313
It's a point of view from which
we've never seen a story before, and

00:04:23.313 --> 00:04:25.485
it's completely impactful in the telling.

00:04:25.485 --> 00:04:29.803
(Music)

00:04:29.803 --> 00:04:32.832
2019 was yet another good year for
exciting cinematic documentaries.

00:04:32.832 --> 00:04:35.884
The capitalist culture
clash of American Factory,

00:04:35.884 --> 00:04:37.844
the meta cinema of Varda by Agnes.

00:04:37.844 --> 00:04:42.134
The magnificently time traveling
restoration of They Shall Not Grow Old,

00:04:42.134 --> 00:04:45.074
the powerful love amidst
destruction of For Sama.

00:04:45.074 --> 00:04:47.682
The ever better ninth
installation of 63 Up.

00:04:47.682 --> 00:04:50.593
But the one that really blew
us back into our seats,

00:04:50.593 --> 00:04:54.260
like five million pounds of rocket fuel,
had to be Apollo 11.

00:04:54.260 --> 00:05:00.616
&gt;&gt; Ten, nine, ignition sequence starts.

00:05:04.891 --> 00:05:10.610
(Sound)
&gt;&gt; Apollo

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:13.455
11 mines an enormous wealth
of archival sources.

00:05:13.455 --> 00:05:17.796
Including some magnificent and previously
undiscovered 7 mm footage to retell

00:05:17.796 --> 00:05:20.590
the story of the moon
landing as if you were there.

00:05:20.590 --> 00:05:24.310
It uses no narration,
no interviews, and no recreation.

00:05:24.310 --> 00:05:27.360
Even the synthesizers used in
the fantastically tense score were

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:28.360
period accurate.

00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:31.250
The story is told almost
completely with recorded

00:05:31.250 --> 00:05:34.280
conversations between the astronauts and
their mission controllers.

00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:37.510
With plenty of screen time set aside
to just marvel at the colossal

00:05:37.510 --> 00:05:38.330
scale of it all.

00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:41.790
And in a year of visually impressive space
movies, that weren't quite our speed,

00:05:41.790 --> 00:05:43.860
some with truly massive CGI budgets.

00:05:43.860 --> 00:05:46.685
They still don't come near
to feeling as awesome and

00:05:46.685 --> 00:05:50.353
monumental as what it was actually
like when we put a man on the moon.

00:05:50.353 --> 00:05:56.610
(Sound)
Next up, what made us laugh this year?

00:05:56.610 --> 00:06:00.090
Well certainly Tyco YTTs
impossibly irreverent Jojo Rabbit.

00:06:00.090 --> 00:06:01.670
If there's a difficulty modifier for

00:06:01.670 --> 00:06:04.730
funny we think the Hitler
comedy is probably the highest.

00:06:04.730 --> 00:06:08.034
But we also love the warm or friendly or
Tarantino of Once Upon a Time

00:06:08.034 --> 00:06:11.173
in Hollywood, Knives Out is so
well written it drives us nuts.

00:06:11.173 --> 00:06:12.860
And it was good to see Eddie Murphy and

00:06:12.860 --> 00:06:15.590
J Low back in full form in
Dolomite Is My Name and Hustlers.

00:06:15.590 --> 00:06:18.820
However, it was a freshman filmmaker
with some relatively unknown actors that

00:06:18.820 --> 00:06:19.870
capture our hearts.

00:06:19.870 --> 00:06:24.430
And our humor this year with our favorite
2019 comedy, and fifth pick, Booksmart.

00:06:24.430 --> 00:06:25.998
&gt;&gt; Name one person whose life was so

00:06:25.998 --> 00:06:28.448
much better because they
broke a couple of rules.

00:06:28.448 --> 00:06:29.502
&gt;&gt; Picasso.

00:06:29.502 --> 00:06:30.656
&gt;&gt; Yes, he broke art rules.

00:06:30.656 --> 00:06:32.456
Name a person who broke a real rule
&gt;&gt; Rosa Parks.

00:06:32.456 --> 00:06:33.670
&gt;&gt; Name another one.
&gt;&gt; Susan B Anthony.

00:06:33.670 --> 00:06:34.550
&gt;&gt; God damn it.

00:06:34.550 --> 00:06:39.005
&gt;&gt; Basically a female Superbad complete
with Nick McLovin esque psychic actually,

00:06:39.005 --> 00:06:40.160
kind of a couple.

00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:42.750
Two girls that played it safe in high
school learn that as they were busy

00:06:42.750 --> 00:06:43.300
studying.

00:06:43.300 --> 00:06:44.930
Their classmates were partying and

00:06:44.930 --> 00:06:47.480
still managed to get into
the Ivy's alongside them.

00:06:47.480 --> 00:06:51.610
So they set out to get themselves into
some good old-fashioned trouble before

00:06:51.610 --> 00:06:52.860
graduation.

00:06:52.860 --> 00:06:54.180
Script is hysterical, and

00:06:54.180 --> 00:06:56.890
the two previously unknown
leads make the dialog crackle.

00:06:56.890 --> 00:07:00.480
Teen romance is handled with far more
complexity than your usual sex comedy

00:07:00.480 --> 00:07:03.700
without ever sacrificing humor for
its honesty.

00:07:03.700 --> 00:07:07.107
It gets the emotions right and
it is the hardest we laugh all year.

00:07:07.107 --> 00:07:11.049
(Sound) Of course, on the opposite
end of the emotional spectrum,

00:07:11.049 --> 00:07:12.530
we have got the tense and the scary.

00:07:12.530 --> 00:07:16.260
There was a lot to like about the young
Ian self confrontation of Us.

00:07:16.260 --> 00:07:20.140
Dread in the sunlight of Midsommar, and
sea shanty insanity of The Lighthouse.

00:07:20.140 --> 00:07:24.120
But they just didn't quite impress us
like Get Out, Hereditary, or The Witch.

00:07:24.120 --> 00:07:26.030
Thrillers though, were a different story.

00:07:26.030 --> 00:07:29.280
Joker was gorgeous, with yet another
performance that proves Joaquin Pheonix

00:07:29.280 --> 00:07:31.380
is an acting talent unlike anyone else.

00:07:31.380 --> 00:07:34.370
Uncut Gems was maybe too good
of a thriller, seriously.

00:07:34.370 --> 00:07:37.330
One of two reasons we're not picking
it is because it gnawed at our stomach

00:07:37.330 --> 00:07:39.860
lining from start to finish
like a two hour panic attack.

00:07:39.860 --> 00:07:43.250
The other reason, of course, is that Bong
Joon Ho's Parasite came out this year.

00:07:43.250 --> 00:07:46.773
And just so happens to be the best
thriller in a very long time.

00:08:08.785 --> 00:08:13.528
(Laugh)
&gt;&gt; Parasite is

00:08:13.528 --> 00:08:16.758
truly unlike any movie we have
ever seen before or since.

00:08:16.758 --> 00:08:19.997
Part comedy, part thriller,
part social drama, mixing and

00:08:19.997 --> 00:08:23.128
transitioning between its
tones effortlessly and often.

00:08:23.128 --> 00:08:26.460
Bong Joon-ho is in full control
of his craft and soaring, and

00:08:26.460 --> 00:08:27.882
then there's the story.

00:08:27.882 --> 00:08:31.077
An hour in you're trying to guess where
the hell this could possibly be going, but

00:08:31.077 --> 00:08:32.470
you can't, it's impossible.

00:08:32.470 --> 00:08:34.680
It always seems like
there's 100 different,

00:08:34.680 --> 00:08:37.300
satisfying ways he could
take it at every turn.

00:08:37.300 --> 00:08:39.790
But he always seems to
pick none of the above and

00:08:39.790 --> 00:08:42.640
do something even more interesting
than you could have imagined.

00:08:42.640 --> 00:08:45.980
In a world where people say silly things
like there's really on seven stories.

00:08:45.980 --> 00:08:49.630
And experienced viewers pride themselves
on the savvy to see every twist and

00:08:49.630 --> 00:08:51.040
turn coming miles in advance.

00:08:51.040 --> 00:08:54.690
Parasite manages to make us feel like
kids at the movie theater again.

00:08:54.690 --> 00:08:58.266
Truly in awe and wonder at what
the silver screen has in store.

00:08:58.266 --> 00:09:03.159
(Sound) It wasn't just Parasite though,
2019 saw some of its most

00:09:03.159 --> 00:09:06.430
interesting movies come from overseas and
outside of Hollywood.

00:09:06.430 --> 00:09:08.650
From China, Ash Is Purest White and

00:09:08.650 --> 00:09:12.340
especially Long Day's Journey into
Night were god damn experiences.

00:09:12.340 --> 00:09:15.650
While Bacurau and
Monos hit hard from South America.

00:09:15.650 --> 00:09:19.330
However, this year we had two favorite
foreign films, and we loved them both so

00:09:19.330 --> 00:09:20.940
dearly we couldn't choose between them.

00:09:20.940 --> 00:09:23.520
So they're getting our numbers three and
four slot.

00:09:23.520 --> 00:09:32.859
They are Pedro Almodovar Pain and
Glory and

00:09:32.859 --> 00:09:39.087
Céline Sciamma’s Portrait

00:09:39.087 --> 00:09:42.984
of a Lady on Fire.

00:10:09.993 --> 00:10:13.598
(Foreign)
&gt;&gt; In Pain and

00:10:13.598 --> 00:10:17.798
Glory we see Almodovar reach for
new personal and autobiographical heights.

00:10:17.798 --> 00:10:21.880
While his life-long collaborator, Antonio
Banderas, delivers a performance subtle

00:10:21.880 --> 00:10:25.250
and honest so far beyond what we
had previously thought in capable.

00:10:25.250 --> 00:10:28.890
It is the story of an aging director
in Madrid struggling with health and

00:10:28.890 --> 00:10:30.950
art turning to heroin in his 50s.

00:10:30.950 --> 00:10:34.070
Mending fences and then breaking
them again and remembering his past.

00:10:34.070 --> 00:10:37.940
The film is at its best when Benderas
shares the screen with his aging mother or

00:10:37.940 --> 00:10:38.920
with his former lover.

00:10:38.920 --> 00:10:42.350
And although neither episodes are very
long, that's sort of seems like the point,

00:10:42.350 --> 00:10:44.880
you love them so much and
really wish they wouldn't go.

00:10:44.880 --> 00:10:48.810
And then there's the final shot, it's
neither tragic, heroic, melodramatic, nor

00:10:48.810 --> 00:10:51.570
flashy, but
there's a power in its simplicity.

00:10:51.570 --> 00:10:53.405
It just broke us into tears

00:10:53.405 --> 00:10:54.158
(Music)

00:10:54.158 --> 00:10:57.715
There's less mystery surrounding the tears
that flooded the theater after Lady on

00:10:57.715 --> 00:11:00.120
Fire's ending, but
they felt very much the same.

00:11:00.120 --> 00:11:04.220
Shama's quiet, gentle masterpiece
follows three women alone in an estate

00:11:04.220 --> 00:11:06.640
on an isolated island over
the course of a week.

00:11:06.640 --> 00:11:08.490
Heloise is to wed against her wishes,

00:11:08.490 --> 00:11:11.390
Mary Ann is to paint her portrait
also against Heloise's wishes.

00:11:11.390 --> 00:11:14.100
And Sophie, the maid,
falls pregnant but doesn't want it.

00:11:14.100 --> 00:11:18.920
The rest is simple, they pass the time,
paint a portrait, fall in love,

00:11:18.920 --> 00:11:20.960
slowly and then very fast.

00:11:20.960 --> 00:11:25.378
Much of the movie is filled with silent
looking, regarding, observing, painting.

00:11:25.378 --> 00:11:29.260
But God, this drama fill each look and
brush stroke with such meaning.

00:11:29.260 --> 00:11:32.894
You never miss the dialogue because
each quiet moment is so very full.

00:11:32.894 --> 00:11:38.066
And by the end, the only thing you miss
is exactly what you are supposed to.

00:11:38.066 --> 00:11:42.925
(Sound) Finally closing out our list and
our year we have our prestige dramas,

00:11:42.925 --> 00:11:44.980
call them our best picture picks.

00:11:44.980 --> 00:11:48.810
This year 1917 was an absolute
roller coaster ride of a story and

00:11:48.810 --> 00:11:52.030
the best possible deacons clap
back at Chivo for Birdman.

00:11:52.030 --> 00:11:55.900
Waves was beautiful and emotional and
sensitive in all the ways that we love.

00:11:55.900 --> 00:11:58.600
Little Women was an absolute
delight in proof positive that

00:11:58.600 --> 00:12:01.120
Greta Gerwig is just too good for
this world.

00:12:01.120 --> 00:12:05.220
And, A HIdden LIfe is malacky
a malick as he ever did malick, but

00:12:05.220 --> 00:12:08.140
god damn that means there's
a lot of beauty amidst his mess.

00:12:08.140 --> 00:12:11.020
&amp;nbsp; However this year we think
nobody has gone as big as Netflix and

00:12:11.020 --> 00:12:12.290
at serious expense.

00:12:12.290 --> 00:12:14.800
They tackled love, loss,
regret, faith, and

00:12:14.800 --> 00:12:17.970
mortality itself in two of
the best movies of the year.

00:12:17.970 --> 00:12:21.890
Baumbach's The Marriage Story and
Scorsese's The Irishman.

00:12:21.890 --> 00:12:22.700
&gt;&gt; What's this?

00:12:22.700 --> 00:12:25.000
&gt;&gt; It's a manilla envelope.

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:25.940
Ooh, can I start over?

00:12:25.940 --> 00:12:27.970
&gt;&gt; It has my name on it.

00:12:27.970 --> 00:12:28.654
&gt;&gt; Ooh.

00:12:33.726 --> 00:12:37.100
Jesus, sorry, you're served.

00:12:38.660 --> 00:12:39.720
&gt;&gt; Feel like I'm in a dream.

00:12:39.720 --> 00:12:43.650
&gt;&gt; We don't have a marriage anymore.

00:12:43.650 --> 00:12:48.989
I know you don't want the disruption, but
you don't want to be married, not really.

00:12:51.360 --> 00:12:52.830
&gt;&gt; But I don't want this.

00:12:52.830 --> 00:12:58.470
&gt;&gt; There's been a change,
instead of going up,

00:12:58.470 --> 00:13:02.950
we're going to hang around tomorrow
morning and then go up and drive home.

00:13:02.950 --> 00:13:05.980
&gt;&gt; But I told Jimmy that we were
going to be up in the morning.

00:13:08.080 --> 00:13:11.240
I told Jimmy we were going to
be up in the morning.

00:13:11.240 --> 00:13:11.740
&gt;&gt; What?

00:13:14.109 --> 00:13:18.700
&gt;&gt; Frank, we did all the could for the man
&gt;&gt; Marriage Story

00:13:18.700 --> 00:13:22.700
sees Baumbach channeling Bergman and
his own marriage to Jennifer Jason Leigh.

00:13:22.700 --> 00:13:26.970
Into a personal, sometimes funny, often
devastating portrait of the parade of 1000

00:13:26.970 --> 00:13:29.030
little heartbreaks that come with divorce.

00:13:29.030 --> 00:13:32.590
The acting is just as good as everyone
singing its praises says it is and

00:13:32.590 --> 00:13:34.990
the empathy for
all involved is practically endless.

00:13:34.990 --> 00:13:37.600
The whole thing is so
clearly somebody's fault but

00:13:37.600 --> 00:13:39.480
nobody really seems to deserve the blame.

00:13:39.480 --> 00:13:43.010
They're all doing their best and they
hurt each other deeply in the process.

00:13:43.010 --> 00:13:46.160
But beneath all this pain and
the resentment it turns in to over and

00:13:46.160 --> 00:13:49.640
over, Baumbach finds an irrepressible
compassion in his characters.

00:13:49.640 --> 00:13:52.090
Because his hope,
that it may well be there in us as well.

00:13:52.090 --> 00:13:54.630
Then there's the Irishman,
it may not be a movie for everyone,

00:13:54.630 --> 00:13:56.890
but my god, was it the movie for us.

00:13:56.890 --> 00:13:58.550
We came in expecting another Goodfellas,

00:13:58.550 --> 00:14:01.780
another Casino, another gangster
story with rapid fire montage.

00:14:01.780 --> 00:14:03.570
And a bunch of Rolling Stones cues and

00:14:03.570 --> 00:14:06.590
every talented Italian American
actor there ever was.

00:14:06.590 --> 00:14:09.400
And you get that for a little while,
until you look down and

00:14:09.400 --> 00:14:12.970
realize it's become something else
entirely right beneath your feet.

00:14:12.970 --> 00:14:16.200
Because it's been 30 minutes since
the last music cue, and suddenly you just

00:14:16.200 --> 00:14:20.020
feel so hollow and sad, as if the best
parts of your life are behind you.

00:14:20.020 --> 00:14:23.290
But you still have so far to go and
no way to turn back time and

00:14:23.290 --> 00:14:25.740
undo your mistakes no
matter how hard you try.

00:14:25.740 --> 00:14:29.040
It brings together the two most
prominent trends of Scorsese's career,

00:14:29.040 --> 00:14:31.600
the criminal epic, and
the religious contemplation.

00:14:31.600 --> 00:14:34.110
And seams them together in
a beautiful alchemy that

00:14:34.110 --> 00:14:38.320
feels like his entire filmography has
been building towards this very moment.

00:14:38.320 --> 00:14:40.325
It's Marty in conversation with himself,

00:14:40.325 --> 00:14:43.260
re-evaluating all the fun he had
with his loveable `scoundrels`.

00:14:43.260 --> 00:14:46.920
Shouldering the full weight of the remorse
a life of crime really `begets`.

00:14:46.920 --> 00:14:51.888
It aches with the heaviness of existence
which is why it's one of our absolute

00:14:51.888 --> 00:14:53.424
favorites of the year.

00:14:53.424 --> 00:14:54.798
(Music)

00:14:54.798 --> 00:14:56.730
So what do you think,
disagree with any of our picks?

00:14:56.730 --> 00:14:58.610
Did we leave out any of your
favorite films of the year?

00:14:58.610 --> 00:15:01.630
Do you think that's because we didn't see
them or just because we didn't like them?

00:15:01.630 --> 00:15:02.540
We'll never tell.

00:15:02.540 --> 00:15:05.027
