00:00:01.140 --> 00:00:07.439
&gt;&gt;Dr. Puls: In our recent discussions we have
been focusing on issues of environmental sustainability

00:00:07.439 --> 00:00:14.439
with oil and gas production, particularly
in the context of drought. Today we have with

00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:21.279
us Nathan Kuhnert. Nathan is an Environmental
Health and Safety Professional with Devon

00:00:21.279 --> 00:00:28.279
Energy, a leading oil and gas producing independent.
Nathan specializes in policy and management

00:00:28.409 --> 00:00:34.760
for Devon and is committed to building sustainable
and economical water management practices

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:37.699
across his company. Welcome Nathan.

00:00:37.699 --> 00:00:39.649
&gt;&gt;Mr. Kuhnert: Thank you Dr. Puls.

00:00:39.649 --> 00:00:46.649
&gt;&gt;Dr. Puls: So I have some questions for you
today. I know Devon has experienced some challenges

00:00:47.469 --> 00:00:54.329
in the sourcing and management of water resources
for their oil and gas operations, especially

00:00:54.329 --> 00:01:01.070
during the recent drought. Can you discuss
how Devon has met the challenge in the context

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:03.210
of sustainable water management?

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:09.920
&gt;&gt;Mr. Kuhnert: I, I appreciate that question
and please let me start with the clarifying

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:16.920
sustainable water management. For, for this
situation, I'm going to refer to those practices

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:26.170
that are practical. They're economical and
ultimately they reduce freshwater consumption

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:36.520
in the basin that we operate in and oftentimes
our overall water use is still pretty far

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:45.399
down in relation to the other users in that
basin. We're very proud that we have found

00:01:45.399 --> 00:01:52.399
some solutions that have been both sustainable
as well as economically viable. And for instance,

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:59.520
I'd like to share with you our Cana reuse
facility. Cana is is a major project of Devon's,

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:08.080
which is approximately starting about 30 miles
west of the greater Oklahoma City area. And

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:15.080
this is in the middle of the Woodford Shale
play and we realize that the relatively low

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:23.819
total dissolved solids that was coming back
during the flow back process was relatively

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:30.730
low and we realized that this water was really
good water and if we could get the regulatory

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:36.760
structure situated with the state that we
could take advantage of this tremendous resource

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:43.720
to help augment our, our overall water supply.
So Oklahoma Corporation Commission passed

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:50.720
a a revised pit rule and now as a result we
have a 500,000 barrel pit out in the Cana

00:02:53.349 --> 00:02:58.760
play and that pit is designed with multiple
layers of environmental protection. It has

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:05.760
a very strong liner, has a leak detection
system and the end result is that we'll be

00:03:05.799 --> 00:03:12.799
able to complete approximately 270 hydrocarbon
wells with just the water that has been sent

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:22.620
to that pit from our producing wells. So that's
definitely a win-win situation for us. Further

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:30.620
to the east in Oklahoma, which is which is
the Mississippi line play, we're not blessed

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:37.620
with as good of water quality in our flow
back process but we've learned and we've continued

00:03:38.299 --> 00:03:44.299
to get better frack designs, fluid designs
from our service providers. So now we're able

00:03:44.299 --> 00:03:51.299
to use some of our produce water directly
for our fracks as well. So those are two examples

00:03:54.720 --> 00:04:01.700
that we're able to really promote sustainability
as well as actually improve our, our overall

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:02.950
business process.

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:09.950
&gt;&gt;Dr. Puls: That's very, that's very interesting.
So two things I'm hearing: one is you are

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:15.519
able to make this work not only from an environmental
sustainability standpoint but also from an

00:04:15.519 --> 00:04:22.519
economical standpoint, and two this issue
of the difference between the two formations

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:29.730
in terms of water quality and the challenges
that presents in terms of then reusing that

00:04:29.730 --> 00:04:36.730
water. So how do you see those lessons and
those two plays going forward with other locations?

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:42.300
&gt;&gt;Mr. Kuhnert: No I appreciate that, because
it seems that it's just been a progression.

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:47.920
You know about eight years ago we started
with the Barnett Shale water recycling facility.

00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:53.850
We had lessons learned and it's just continued.
We just continue to build upon that. We've

00:04:53.850 --> 00:05:00.850
learned of course that not one size fits all.
The water quality not only can vary from one

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:08.210
play to another but often it varies inter
play, as well as the volumes of water that

00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:15.210
will be coming back during the flow back process.
So we have to design a system that can account

00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:23.280
for that type of variability. In another large
variable that we have to plan for is that

00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:33.500
depending on what phase of your exploration
process that you're in or in your actual infield

00:05:33.970 --> 00:05:40.890
drilling program, it has a huge implication
of what type of infrastructure and resources

00:05:40.890 --> 00:05:47.890
you can design, you know, for more alternative
solutions that are more sustainable-based.

00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:56.600
So often we want to start off with a more
flexible type of design and then later if

00:05:57.760 --> 00:06:04.110
the play is proven to be economically viable,
that's when we can really begin to develop

00:06:04.110 --> 00:06:08.710
more larger scale infrastructure to do these
types of projects.

00:06:08.710 --> 00:06:15.460
&gt;&gt;Dr. Puls: So what this means then is that
you really had to take an adaptive management

00:06:15.460 --> 00:06:22.460
approach in terms of these things since they
oftentimes are unknown in terms of what you're

00:06:22.500 --> 00:06:28.240
going to encounter, how things are going to
work in a particular location and so forth?

00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:34.320
&gt;&gt;Mr. Kuhnert: Absolutely. And and so we're
still learning, I mean we're still optimizing

00:06:34.320 --> 00:06:40.100
the process, but we definitely have made great
strides in adaptive management approach of

00:06:40.100 --> 00:06:41.800
the last couple of years.

00:06:41.800 --> 00:06:48.800
&gt;&gt;Dr. Puls: Besides recycling of flow back
produced waters, are you looking at recycling

00:06:51.450 --> 00:06:58.450
of other kinds of waters or other types of
water sourcing besides just reuse and recycling?

00:07:00.990 --> 00:07:07.990
&gt;&gt;Mr. Kuhnert: That's a good question. A really
hot topic over the last year or two has been

00:07:08.200 --> 00:07:15.200
brackish water. You know, brackish water is...it
could be defined differently as far as what

00:07:15.790 --> 00:07:22.790
is the total dissolved solids concentration
and so brackish water from our standpoint

00:07:23.360 --> 00:07:30.360
is water that's beyond fresh, but ultimately
the higher the total dissolved solids content

00:07:31.580 --> 00:07:37.470
is then it does create some more management
hurdles to have to go through to, to be able

00:07:37.470 --> 00:07:42.900
to come up with the optimal process. In the
state of Texas for instance, the Texas Water

00:07:42.900 --> 00:07:49.620
Development Board is putting together proposal
to study brackish water resources in in the

00:07:49.620 --> 00:07:56.620
Permian Basin. Devon currently is involved
with a consortium down loosely associated

00:07:57.980 --> 00:08:03.820
with Rice University, where they're looking
to be able to optimize brackish water as well.

00:08:03.820 --> 00:08:10.820
So brackish water is definitely an alternative
source solution but we just have to continue

00:08:11.030 --> 00:08:18.030
to further understand the, the processes and
make sure it's not going to have adverse impact

00:08:18.480 --> 00:08:25.310
to our, not only our frack design but the
actual formation itself that we would be injecting,

00:08:25.310 --> 00:08:32.310
you know, that solution down into. One other
alternative source of water that we're looking

00:08:33.229 --> 00:08:40.229
into as well is just wastewater `effluent`.
That hasn't been tried on a large-scale practice

00:08:41.770 --> 00:08:48.510
because there's still a lot more unknowns
with that as well as logistical considerations

00:08:48.510 --> 00:08:50.130
and stakeholder concerns.

00:08:50.130 --> 00:08:57.130
&gt;&gt;Dr. Puls: In in all of this it seems like
there's like an increased emphasis on working

00:08:57.630 --> 00:09:04.630
with multiple stakeholders, particularly state
agencies. Agencies that are involved with

00:09:07.990 --> 00:09:14.990
water quality, agencies involved with permitting.
You mentioned the Oklahoma Corporation Commission

00:09:16.990 --> 00:09:22.360
and the, the groups in Texas. How has that
been working in terms of cooperation?

00:09:22.360 --> 00:09:27.680
&gt;&gt;Mr. Kuhnert: It's it's been very successful.
I think our industry has discovered as well

00:09:27.680 --> 00:09:34.680
as Devon that transparency is the key. You
know, we want to sit down and share our practices

00:09:35.060 --> 00:09:42.060
as well as our needs to the stakeholders and
regulators so that we can all benefit together.

00:09:43.820 --> 00:09:50.820
When I say needs, that often entails for for
us anyway, is having a risk-based permitting

00:09:51.360 --> 00:09:56.870
approach so that if we're transparent and
we can really share with the stakeholders

00:09:56.870 --> 00:10:03.870
and the regulators just what entails our overall
water management process, including the the

00:10:05.130 --> 00:10:09.370
produced water that comes back during the
flow back phase, then I think that that can

00:10:09.370 --> 00:10:16.370
really lead and has led to more of a comfort
level from the regulators as well as the stakeholders

00:10:17.260 --> 00:10:22.770
to allowing us to do more with this produced
water that comes back.

00:10:22.770 --> 00:10:29.230
&gt;&gt;Dr. Puls: What about the general public
in communities where you operate? How does

00:10:29.230 --> 00:10:36.230
that factor into this whole issue of sustainable
water management? Is there more engagement

00:10:37.730 --> 00:10:41.850
with the public, the local communities as
you tackle these issues?

00:10:41.850 --> 00:10:47.240
&gt;&gt;Mr. Kuhnert: Yes. There definitely has been
a lot more engagement especially after the

00:10:47.240 --> 00:10:52.810
drought from, from two seasons ago I guess
that was the drought that started in what,

00:10:52.810 --> 00:10:59.020
fall of 2010 and really picked up there in
the following summer. But there's no question

00:10:59.020 --> 00:11:06.020
that that is a major consideration that we
have to address when we go into a community,

00:11:06.500 --> 00:11:13.500
because ultimately we have to earn our license
to operate. And so it's no longer just ensuring

00:11:14.120 --> 00:11:20.750
the stakeholders that we're protecting their
the groundwater and surface water from water

00:11:20.750 --> 00:11:27.750
quality problems, but it's actually you know
drawdown concerns. We have to really be transparent

00:11:27.930 --> 00:11:33.430
and give them some level of comfort that we're
not going to be taking too much water out

00:11:33.430 --> 00:11:34.910
of the basin that we're operating in.

00:11:34.910 --> 00:11:41.910
&gt;&gt;Dr. Puls: And what do you see as some of
the greatest challenges going forward, in

00:11:43.540 --> 00:11:46.570
in terms of the whole issue of sustainable
water management?

00:11:46.570 --> 00:11:52.690
&gt;&gt;Mr. Kuhnert: That's a good question. As
we alluded to earlier, there's been tremendous

00:11:52.690 --> 00:11:59.690
technological advances in frack fluid designs
that are more tolerant for lower quality water,

00:11:59.740 --> 00:12:06.740
as well as really innovations in the technologies
around recycling or reuse. But what I believe

00:12:07.720 --> 00:12:14.720
is really necessary may not be quite as, I
guess, science based necessarily or engineering

00:12:14.750 --> 00:12:21.750
based but it's just overall planning. Rolling
up the sleeves and getting all these variables

00:12:22.730 --> 00:12:29.730
on the table at the same time to really design,
you know, your best water management scheme

00:12:31.230 --> 00:12:38.230
based on the environment that you're operating
in. I think that's the key as well as the

00:12:39.070 --> 00:12:46.070
stakeholders and the regulators also looking
at a holistic approach when it comes to water

00:12:49.390 --> 00:12:55.529
problems. As we all know there's multiple
users in a basin and I think to really come

00:12:55.529 --> 00:13:02.529
up with a pragmatic solution, you really have
to bring all the users to the table and promote

00:13:03.100 --> 00:13:10.100
transparency and potential partnering to really
come up with the best way to leverage resources

00:13:11.060 --> 00:13:13.800
to, to ultimately conserve water.

00:13:13.800 --> 00:13:18.910
&gt;&gt;Dr. Puls: Well thank you. I I really want
to thank you for being with us today and and

00:13:18.910 --> 00:13:25.910
giving us these insights into not only how
Devon is going forward and operating in new

00:13:27.070 --> 00:13:30.860
areas, but the industry as a whole. So thank
you Nathan.

00:13:30.860 --> 00:13:32.320
&gt;&gt;Mr. Kuhnert: Well thank you for this opportunity.
