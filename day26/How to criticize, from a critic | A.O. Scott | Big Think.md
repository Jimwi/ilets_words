00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:08.840
There was one pull quote I saw.

00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:14.900
I won't say what critic wrote it but I remember
like seeing it was an adverb adjective combination,

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:18.660
which is especially dangerous and like not
to be messed with.

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:21.760
A movie described as fiercely hypnotic.

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:25.360
And I remember thinking like what the hell
does that mean?

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:26.940
First of all, those don't seem to go together.

00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:28.250
How can you be fiercely hypnotized?

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:30.560
Also, if you're hypnotized doesn't it mean
you're asleep?

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:32.460
I mean is that good?

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:37.820
Or if your fiercely hypnotized are you somehow
in a state of intense sleep?

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:41.160
So I thought what could that possibly be?

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:46.780
The worst adjective of them all though, the
one that is the most overused and the one

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:51.170
I did work at a publication where the editor
would always ban it and would always just

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:57.310
kind of get on the phone and say I'm sorry
we can't print the word compelling because

00:00:57.310 --> 00:01:03.710
that is just like maybe one of the emptiest
words in the language.

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:05.570
Like who does it compel?

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:08.490
Compel to do what?

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:14.400
It just kind of is this empty placeholder
for something.

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:15.590
This was a compelling book.

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:16.770
What did it compel you to do?

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:20.020
I don't know, it could have compelled you
to stop reading it.

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:26.590
Adjectives can be your friend and there is
an old fashioned approach I think that comes

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:32.170
out of Hemingway and some school writing teachers
will tell you cut out all the additives and

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:33.170
the adverbs.

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:34.170
Make it simple.

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:35.170
Make it clean.

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:36.760
I don't necessarily believe in that.

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:43.619
And if you write criticism for a newspaper
your editors will really want some adjectives,

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:49.340
especially if you have a review that starting
on the front page let's say of a section.

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:53.740
This is a print thing so some of you younger
people might not follow it, but then jumps

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:58.970
to a later page, the editors will very often
want an adjective before the jump that will

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:00.159
just sum up what you think.

00:02:00.159 --> 00:02:05.350
So can you just say like in this marvelous
new film or in this disappointing, something.

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:12.040
In a way to excuse any reader who's in a hurry
or has a short attention span from reading

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:14.760
all the way to the end.

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:17.340
And I've often fought back against that for
just that reason.

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:21.180
If you want to know what I think you have
to read the whole thing.

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:31.040
Adjectives can be very useful and can be a
way of evoking qualities that you want to

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:32.040
convey.

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:35.150
Part of what you're doing when you're criticizing,
when you're writing criticism, is describing.

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:38.790
So you want to find the right descriptors.

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:45.379
On the other hand there is a kind of emptiness
to certain kinds of critical adjectives that

00:02:45.379 --> 00:02:52.800
you have to be careful of and that can kind
of get you into a little bit of trouble that

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:58.790
are just empty, so mesmerizing, stunning,
exhilarating, thrilling, all of these things

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:07.879
that are kind of really describing your own
reaction or your own response to this as if

00:03:07.879 --> 00:03:10.879
they were qualities of the thing itself.

00:03:10.879 --> 00:03:11.980
You were excited.

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:13.239
You were thrilled.

00:03:13.239 --> 00:03:14.239
You were stunned.

00:03:14.239 --> 00:03:19.650
You were mesmerized, the person writing, but
you're kind of making a little bit of a leap

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:25.620
when you're pretending that that's an inherent
quality of what you're writing about.

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:33.220
And I have to say in all honesty I've had
a little bit of an adjective crisis myself

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:40.620
since publishing this book because I write
in it against adjectives I try to be very

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:47.340
stingy as a critic with the sort of empty
inflated adjective.

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:50.760
But I've read some reviews of my own book
and I wish that there were more of them.

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:55.440
I was like could you have just stuck like
a brilliant in there?

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:59.489
Something we can put in the ads to sell more
copies?

00:03:59.489 --> 00:04:01.930
So I'm a total hypocrite in that regard.
