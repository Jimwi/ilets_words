Small Bedroom Design | 2017

I want to address the room in our home that often gets left to last, and that is the bedroom, and give you some simple, easy ideas to decorate your small space bedroom. 

Tip number one in your small space bedroom is I kind of say, "Go white." When I say, "Go white," I mean sometimes in paint, I think choosing a warm white really opens up the space, and I love white in your bedding, and before you say, "No way. I've got dogs, I've got kids, I can't have white bedding." You can. Get two sets if possible. Change it up and it can be washed. I have two kids and a dog, and white bedding is just beautiful. It opens up the space and makes it appear larger. 

Tip number two is you want a focal point. Now everyone talks a lot about focal points, so I'm going to explain a little bit what I mean, especially in a small bedroom. When you walk into the room, you want something maybe besides the bed, that catches your attention. This could be a beautiful light fixture, or what I've done is put a `ginormous` painting above my bed. The reason I've done this is it really detracts from the size of the room, that it's small, and what you see and what you gravitate towards is that painting. Try something `a little out of the box` that creates that focal point that distracts your eye. 

Tip number three is to use a shelf for your side table. Yes, a little shelf. That's what I've, personally, done. If you don't have room for a large side table with drawers and all the rest of it, especially if you're in a `condo` or a small space, think about just a simple shelf. You can put your glass of water on there. You can put your book on there, and a great tip for instead of then having a drawer, which you're missing, is to put a basket beside your bed, and that can hold all your extra stuff. 

Tip number four is because you have this shelf, possibly for your side table, putting a lamp on there is going to take up a lot of good real estate, so think about a sconce. I love all the wall sconces right now, or an actual `pendant` that hangs from the ceiling is another beautiful option. It takes up no real estate on your side table, and it looks really trendy, and really beautiful in your room. 

Tip number five is if you haven't got a bed already and you're going to invest in a new one, there are a ton of beds right now with actual storage. They have drawers that you can pull out, or you can pull up the bed, and actually store things. This makes a huge difference and putting all those seasonable items that you don't use. I hope this has inspired you in decorating your bedroom. To help you out, what I've done is included a freebie of the top five things that every room needs, and I use to make sure every room has, and I have a link to it below.
