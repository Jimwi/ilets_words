00:00:06.871 --> 00:00:12.413
Satan, the beast crunching sinners’ bones
in his subterranean lair.

00:00:12.413 --> 00:00:17.329
Lucifer, the fallen angel raging 
against the established order.

00:00:17.704 --> 00:00:23.413
Mephistopheles, the trickster striking 
deals with unsuspecting humans.

00:00:24.246 --> 00:00:30.163
These three divergent devils are all based
on Satan of the Old Testament,

00:00:30.163 --> 00:00:35.287
an angelic member of God’s court 
who torments Job in the Book of Job.

00:00:35.871 --> 00:00:38.996
But unlike any of these literary devils,

00:00:38.996 --> 00:00:43.079
the Satan of the Bible was 
a relatively minor character,

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:47.079
with scant information about his deeds 
or appearance.

00:00:47.079 --> 00:00:52.829
So how did he become the ultimate 
antagonist, with so many different forms?

00:00:53.912 --> 00:00:58.162
In the New Testament, 
Satan saw a little more action:

00:00:58.162 --> 00:01:01.829
tempting Jesus,
using demons to possess people,

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:07.079
and finally appearing as a giant dragon 
who is cast into hell.

00:01:07.788 --> 00:01:13.288
This last image particularly inspired
medieval artists and writers,

00:01:13.288 --> 00:01:18.621
who depicted a scaled, shaggy-furred
creature with overgrown toenails.

00:01:19.288 --> 00:01:23.121
In Michael Pacher’s painting 
of St. Augustine and the Devil,

00:01:23.121 --> 00:01:26.246
the devil appears as an upright lizard—

00:01:26.246 --> 00:01:30.496
with a second miniature face 
glinting on his rear and.

00:01:31.454 --> 00:01:34.163
The epitome of these monster Satans

00:01:34.163 --> 00:01:38.829
appeared in Italian poet 
Dante Alighieri’s “Inferno.”

00:01:39.579 --> 00:01:42.329
Encased in the ninth circle of hell,

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:48.454
Dante’s Satan is a three-headed,
bat-winged behemoth who feasts on sinners.

00:01:48.454 --> 00:01:51.579
But he’s also an object of pity:

00:01:51.579 --> 00:01:54.704
powerless as the panicked beating 
of his wings

00:01:54.704 --> 00:01:57.954
only encases him further in ice.

00:01:57.954 --> 00:02:03.371
The poem’s protagonist escapes from hell
by clambering over Satan’s body,

00:02:03.371 --> 00:02:08.496
and feels both disgust and sympathy
for the trapped beast—

00:02:08.496 --> 00:02:12.621
prompting the reader to consider
the pain of doing evil.

00:02:13.621 --> 00:02:18.663
By the Renaissance, the devil started
to assume a more human form.

00:02:18.663 --> 00:02:23.538
Artists painted him as a man 
with cloven hooves and curling horns

00:02:23.538 --> 00:02:26.829
inspired by Pan,
the Greek god of the wild.

00:02:27.579 --> 00:02:31.371
In his 1667 masterpiece “Paradise Lost,”

00:02:31.371 --> 00:02:35.871
English poet John Milton depicted
the devil as Lucifer,

00:02:35.871 --> 00:02:40.621
an angel who started a rebellion 
on the grounds that God is too powerful.

00:02:41.246 --> 00:02:45.579
Kicked out of heaven, 
this charismatic rebel becomes Satan,

00:02:45.579 --> 00:02:50.204
and declares that he’d rather rule in hell
than serve in heaven.

00:02:50.996 --> 00:02:56.746
Milton’s take inspired numerous depictions
of Lucifer as an ambiguous figure,

00:02:56.746 --> 00:02:58.913
rather than a purely evil one.

00:02:59.579 --> 00:03:05.829
Milton’s Lucifer later became an iconic
character for the Romantics of the 1800s,

00:03:05.829 --> 00:03:12.079
who saw him as a hero who defied higher
power in pursuit of essential truths,

00:03:12.079 --> 00:03:14.329
with tragic consequences.

00:03:15.246 --> 00:03:18.413
Meanwhile, in the German legend 
of Doctor Faust,

00:03:18.413 --> 00:03:20.871
which dates to the 16th century,

00:03:20.871 --> 00:03:24.204
we get a look at what happens 
when the devil comes to Earth.

00:03:25.079 --> 00:03:27.788
Faust, a dissatisfied scholar,

00:03:27.788 --> 00:03:32.204
pledges his soul to the devil
in exchange for bottomless pleasure.

00:03:32.913 --> 00:03:36.246
With the help 
of the devil’s messenger Mephistopheles,

00:03:36.246 --> 00:03:40.163
Faust quickly seizes 
women, power, and money—

00:03:40.163 --> 00:03:43.621
only to fall into the eternal fires 
of hell.

00:03:44.788 --> 00:03:49.121
Later versions of the story show
Mephistopheles in different lights.

00:03:49.121 --> 00:03:50.871
In Christopher Marlowe's account,

00:03:50.871 --> 00:03:55.871
a cynical Doctor Faustus is happy 
to strike a deal with Mephistopheles.

00:03:55.871 --> 00:03:58.454
In Johann Wolfgang van Goethe’s version,

00:03:58.454 --> 00:04:02.663
Mephistopheles tricks Faust
into a grisly deal.

00:04:02.663 --> 00:04:08.663
Today, a Faustian bargain refers 
to a trade that sacrifices integrity

00:04:08.663 --> 00:04:10.621
for short-term gains.

00:04:11.329 --> 00:04:13.538
In stagings of Goethe’s play,

00:04:13.538 --> 00:04:16.871
Mephistopheles appeared 
in red tights and cape.

00:04:17.329 --> 00:04:21.871
This version of the devil was often
played as a charming trickster—

00:04:21.871 --> 00:04:24.704
one that eventually paraded 
through comic books,

00:04:24.704 --> 00:04:28.454
advertising, and film in his red suit.

00:04:28.704 --> 00:04:33.454
These three takes on the devil 
are just the tip of the iceberg:

00:04:33.496 --> 00:04:37.996
the devil continues to stalk 
the public imagination to this day,

00:04:38.038 --> 00:04:41.704
tempting artists of all kinds 
to render him

00:04:41.704 --> 00:04:45.246
according to new and fantastical visions.
