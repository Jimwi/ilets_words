00:00:06.970 --> 00:00:11.620
For thousands of years, mankind's only source
of healthcare was the local witch doctor,

00:00:11.620 --> 00:00:16.410
druid, shaman, or spirit healer, yet while
modern medicine has long done away with these

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:20.710
traditions, many of today's medicines and
treatments have their roots in what was once

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:21.960
considered magic.

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:26.300
Druids and witches in ancient Europe, for
example, were renowned for their use of various

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:31.360
plants, herbs, and fungi to treat injuries,
and modern science has discovered strong antibiotic

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:33.820
properties in many of these ingredients.

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:35.570
But what about the darker side of magic?

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:39.430
That’s what we’ll explore today, in this
episode of The Infographics Show, Black magic

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:41.480
potions and spells.

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:43.890
First though, what exactly is 'black' magic?

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:49.210
For believers and practitioners magic is divided
into positive and beneficial energies: white

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:53.210
magic, and negative and harmful energies-
or black magic.

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:58.530
Magic used with the intent to heal or comfort
is a hallmark of 'white' witches and casters,

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:04.600
while magic meant to intimidate, manipulate,
or hurt others is practiced by 'dark' or 'black'

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:05.600
witches.

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:09.890
But magic goes beyond just actually casting
spells or drinking potions- many practitioners

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:15.260
believe that magic is nothing more than harnessing
the `latent` energies that surround all of us,

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:19.211
thus if you wish someone well and say things
like “I hope you have a good day”, you

00:01:19.211 --> 00:01:23.260
are projecting positive energy at them and
'casting' a white magic spell.

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:28.290
If you yell at someone and wish them harm,
then you're in effect casting a black magic

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:29.479
spell on them.

00:01:29.479 --> 00:01:33.970
Many magic practitioners believe in living
positive and uplifting lives, and when they

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:38.880
harness magic to make their desires reality,
often do so with the intention that their

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:43.350
will be done in harmony with the universe-
not in opposition to it.

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:48.610
Take for example author Steve Pavlina's Million
Dollar Experiment- Mr. Pavlina and a group

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:54.530
of 1730 people all attempted to prove the
power of collective intent for good will and

00:01:54.530 --> 00:02:00.190
for two years held the following intent consciously
in their minds: “In an easy and relaxed

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:04.939
manner, in a healthy and positive way, in
its own perfect time, for the highest good

00:02:04.939 --> 00:02:11.209
of all, I intend $1,000,000 to come into my
life and into the lives of everyone who holds

00:02:11.209 --> 00:02:12.590
this intention.”

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:22.860
After two years the group manifested a combined
total of $1,247,929.17 in extra money, or

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:25.510
about $721 per person.

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:29.480
Not bad for doing nothing more than just thinking
for 60 seconds a day!

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:33.760
With their intent being to seek balance and
harmony with the will of the universe, and

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:39.230
not to oppose it even if it means they don't
each get $1,000,000, white magic practitioners

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:44.120
have in fact many similarities with the most
devout Christians or Muslims, whom also strive

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:49.310
to better their own lives in accordance with
and submitting to a higher, greater authority.

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:52.500
But what about black witches, sorcerers and
warlocks?

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:57.200
What spells and potions do they wield against
a seemingly helpless population?

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:02.690
Love Potion: An old standby of magic, the
love potion is as timeless as... well, love

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:03.690
itself.

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:08.170
While white magic practitioners may create
potions meant to attract love, black magic

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:13.190
practitioners devise potions meant to `bewitch`
and ensnare the targets of their unwanted

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:14.190
affections.

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:19.920
To create a love potion you will need 7 coriander
seeds, a cup of water, a straining cloth,

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:21.330
and a mortar and pestle.

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:25.371
Before you start crafting the potion you must
say the name of your target three times, then

00:03:25.371 --> 00:03:31.080
begin chanting the following as you grind
the 7 coriander seeds: “Warm seeds, warm

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:32.879
heart, let us never be apart.”

00:03:32.879 --> 00:03:37.459
As you crush the seeds and chant you must
focus your energy and affection onto the seeds

00:03:37.459 --> 00:03:42.150
themselves, transferring energy and creating
the energy charge for the spell.

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:47.030
Once properly chanted and crushed, put 3 pinches
of the seeds into the water and let the mixture

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:49.650
sit in a chalice for 12 hours.

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:53.989
Then strain the potion and simply have your
victim ingest it, though as anyone who has

00:03:53.989 --> 00:03:59.240
ever dated knows: someone might seem great
at first only to be unbearable with time...

00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:04.519
so maybe it's better to do it the old fashioned
way rather than be stalked forever by a creepazoid.

00:04:04.519 --> 00:04:07.800
Freezing spell: Have an annoying co-worker
that just won't stop bothering you about the

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:10.140
latest Marvel Cinematic Universe spoiler?

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:12.640
Or perhaps your love potion worked a little
too well?

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:17.949
No problem- try a freezing spell to discourage
that person from bothering you anymore.

00:04:17.949 --> 00:04:22.150
Not meant to literally freeze a person, freezing
spells are meant to stop the occurrence of

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:25.120
something- in this case, a person bothering
you.

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:29.660
For a freezing spell you will need a picture
of the person you want to freeze, a black

00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:32.449
candle, lighter, and an elastic bond.

00:04:32.449 --> 00:04:36.650
Start by placing the picture on your altar-
if you don't have an altar prepared, a simple

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:39.290
google search can help you find out how to
create one.

00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:43.699
Then light your candle and meditate for five
minutes on the person leaving you alone completely.

00:04:43.699 --> 00:04:47.830
Let the candle burn on its own for at least
ten minutes, then extinguish it and believe

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:50.620
in your heart that the person has left your
life.

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:54.800
Take the photo and wrap it around the candle,
securing it with the elastic band.

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:59.910
As you secure the photo, recite aloud: “As
of today, you will move away from me, you

00:04:59.910 --> 00:05:02.790
will have no power over me, you do not see
me anymore.”

00:05:02.790 --> 00:05:06.910
Then place the wrapped candle in the freezer
and continue to meditate on this person leaving

00:05:06.910 --> 00:05:10.820
you alone, and simply leave the items in the
freezer for as long as you want the person

00:05:10.820 --> 00:05:11.990
to stay away.

00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:17.020
Restraining orders are also a good alternative,
and don't require a magical altar.

00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:20.780
Spell to separate a married couple: Is the
target of your affection proving immune to

00:05:20.780 --> 00:05:21.970
your witch brews?

00:05:21.970 --> 00:05:25.500
Or perhaps he or she thinks its creepy you
keep trying to get them to drink your strange

00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:26.500
green water?

00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:27.500
Are they married?

00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:30.770
Good news, there's a spell for you to help
ensure the marriage fails.

00:05:30.770 --> 00:05:35.430
However, this spell can also be used to break
other bonds, such as those of a husband and

00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:37.419
his mistress or vice versa.

00:05:37.419 --> 00:05:41.460
You'll need white clothing to wear during
the ritual, though according to our research

00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:46.110
it is completely acceptable to perform this
ritual while completely naked, and honestly-

00:05:46.110 --> 00:05:47.110
why not?

00:05:47.110 --> 00:05:51.419
You'll also need a black bag, a plastic knife,
a large lemon, a photograph of the couple

00:05:51.419 --> 00:05:53.740
you wish to split, and six small nails.

00:05:53.740 --> 00:05:58.419
You should perform your ritual at night- especially
if you're butt-naked- and start by saying

00:05:58.419 --> 00:06:00.180
the seven prayers of creed.

00:06:00.180 --> 00:06:03.800
If you're not up on your creed prayers (not
the band), again a simple google search will

00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:05.830
help you get the info you need.

00:06:05.830 --> 00:06:10.530
Once the prayers are completed, cut the photograph
of the couple so that only the faces remain.

00:06:10.530 --> 00:06:15.560
Then take the lemon in your right hand and
say the following: Behemoth, destroy this

00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:19.460
relationship, let their togetherness bring
only pain, I bring to you this lemon as an

00:06:19.460 --> 00:06:22.120
offering, please destroy this relationship.”

00:06:22.120 --> 00:06:26.780
Then use the knife and cut the lemon, putting
it and the knife into the black bag.

00:06:26.780 --> 00:06:31.139
Our source warns that at this point you may
feel chills, but it is important not to break

00:06:31.139 --> 00:06:35.570
your concentration or look into the bag, remain
focused on your dastardly deed.

00:06:35.570 --> 00:06:39.860
Then turn the photo around so the faces are
looking away from you and place it inside

00:06:39.860 --> 00:06:44.060
the bag with the lemon, while singing aloud:
Prince Behemoth, break this relationship,

00:06:44.060 --> 00:06:45.419
I (state your name) ask.

00:06:45.419 --> 00:06:48.890
Break the relationship between (state full
names of those you wish separated).

00:06:48.890 --> 00:06:49.890
Sing the song six times before closing the
bag, then use the six nails to close it.

00:06:49.890 --> 00:06:51.139
Sing the song six more times as you do this.

00:06:51.139 --> 00:06:55.110
At the end of the ritual put the bag in a
dark place where no one can find it, but make

00:06:55.110 --> 00:06:59.330
sure you discard the knife after the ritual
and do not place it inside the bag.

00:06:59.330 --> 00:07:02.569
It's plastic, so be a kind witch and recycle
it.

00:07:02.569 --> 00:07:07.070
Three Kings Ghost Summoning: A ritual meant
to allow you to access the “side of the

00:07:07.070 --> 00:07:10.860
shadows”, this ritual is not for the faint
of heart and allows you to summon a ghost

00:07:10.860 --> 00:07:12.050
from the other side.

00:07:12.050 --> 00:07:16.660
Of all the research we conducted, this ritual
held the most warnings against abuse and the

00:07:16.660 --> 00:07:22.180
risk of serious consequences, going so far
as to state that absolutely no drugs or alcohol

00:07:22.180 --> 00:07:24.180
should be used the night of the ritual.

00:07:24.180 --> 00:07:28.990
You will need a large empty room without windows,
or if it has windows then they should be covered

00:07:28.990 --> 00:07:31.199
so the room is completely pitch black.

00:07:31.199 --> 00:07:36.180
You'll also need a pack of candles and lighter,
a bucket of water with a cup, a fan, two large

00:07:36.180 --> 00:07:41.560
mirrors, three chairs, an alarm clock, a fully
charged cell phone, a trusted assistant, and

00:07:41.560 --> 00:07:44.340
a toy or valuable object from your childhood.

00:07:44.340 --> 00:07:49.330
Begin the ritual at exactly 11 pm by placing
the first chair facing north, then the other

00:07:49.330 --> 00:07:53.900
two chairs should go to the left and right-
the north-facing chair is to be heretofore

00:07:53.900 --> 00:07:55.330
known as “the throne”.

00:07:55.330 --> 00:08:00.060
The distance between the throne and the other
two chairs, one representing the queen and

00:08:00.060 --> 00:08:03.090
the other the jester, should be about arm's
length.

00:08:03.090 --> 00:08:06.660
Place the large mirrors in each of the chairs
so that they face each other- you should be

00:08:06.660 --> 00:08:09.560
able to see your own reflection out of the
corner of your eye.

00:08:09.560 --> 00:08:14.130
Place the bucket of water and the cup in front
of you just out of reach, and the fan directly

00:08:14.130 --> 00:08:17.560
behind you turned on at either low or medium.

00:08:17.560 --> 00:08:22.260
Set the alarm for 3:30 AM and go to a separate
room, leave the door open and turn off the

00:08:22.260 --> 00:08:25.640
lights and go to sleep while embracing the
childhood object.

00:08:25.640 --> 00:08:30.790
Once the alarm rings at 3:30 wake up and turn
it off but do not turn on any lights, you

00:08:30.790 --> 00:08:34.449
will then have three minutes to light the
candle, take your cell phone with you and

00:08:34.449 --> 00:08:39.569
sit on the throne with your childhood object-
it is vital you are seated at 3:33 on the

00:08:39.569 --> 00:08:40.569
throne.

00:08:40.569 --> 00:08:44.600
Here our source warns that practitioners should
be aware of some serious red flags- if your

00:08:44.600 --> 00:08:49.970
alarm didn't go off at 3:30 am exactly, or
if you find the doors to your room closed

00:08:49.970 --> 00:08:54.910
or if the fan is off then it is imperative
you do not continue the ritual!

00:08:54.910 --> 00:08:59.600
If you abort the ritual for any reason at
all then you and everyone in the house must

00:08:59.600 --> 00:09:04.569
leave and go to a hotel or a friend's house,
not to return until after 6 AM.

00:09:04.569 --> 00:09:09.850
If however everything is going to plan and
you are sitting on the throne at 3:33 AM with

00:09:09.850 --> 00:09:14.839
your candle, childhood object and cell phone,then
it is imperative that you do not look into

00:09:14.839 --> 00:09:19.410
the mirrors on the chairs at your sides, nor
let the candle go out as the fan continues

00:09:19.410 --> 00:09:20.759
to blow behind you.

00:09:20.759 --> 00:09:24.949
Look straight ahead into the pitch darkness
and maintain your concentration, it is important

00:09:24.949 --> 00:09:28.290
you do not `waiver` for a second and maintain
your focus.

00:09:28.290 --> 00:09:33.540
Eventually a figure or entity will manifest
in the darkness- no matter what it does it

00:09:33.540 --> 00:09:38.850
is vital that you keep your focus and don't
look away, into the mirrors, or at your candle.

00:09:38.850 --> 00:09:43.110
Remain looking straight ahead and seated until
4:34 in the morning.

00:09:43.110 --> 00:09:46.600
This will complete the ritual and bind the
entity to you.

00:09:46.600 --> 00:09:48.999
Failure could have dire consequences.

00:09:48.999 --> 00:09:54.980
To end the ritual your assistant must enter
the room at exactly 4:34 and call out to you,

00:09:54.980 --> 00:09:56.290
breaking your concentration.

00:09:56.290 --> 00:10:00.610
If they are unable to, have them call your
cell phone which you should still be holding.

00:10:00.610 --> 00:10:04.339
If that still doesn't work then they must
use the bucket of water and throw it directly

00:10:04.339 --> 00:10:05.339
onto you.

00:10:05.339 --> 00:10:10.100
The assistant must also ensure that they do
not touch any of the ritual objects nor interact

00:10:10.100 --> 00:10:14.230
with any possible entities , and under no
circumstances should they ever physically

00:10:14.230 --> 00:10:15.230
touch you.

00:10:15.230 --> 00:10:19.220
With the alleged power to summon spirits,
demons and apparitions to do their bidding,

00:10:19.220 --> 00:10:24.129
as well as craft potions to enchant and bedevil
us, it's a good thing for us non-practitioners

00:10:24.129 --> 00:10:28.069
that the numbers of white witches vastly outnumber
those of black witches.

00:10:28.069 --> 00:10:32.889
If you fear though that you may be under attack
by black magics, one of our sources recommended

00:10:32.889 --> 00:10:37.629
that you surround yourself with positive energies,
do things that you enjoy, and be around people

00:10:37.629 --> 00:10:39.420
that love and care about you.

00:10:39.420 --> 00:10:44.139
The light energies produced will counter any
dark energies aimed at you and neutralize

00:10:44.139 --> 00:10:58.959
the harmful effects.

00:10:58.959 --> 00:11:25.339
So, are 
you a practitioner of magic?

00:11:25.339 --> 00:11:28.120
Have you ever cast a white or black magic
spell?

00:11:28.120 --> 00:11:31.499
