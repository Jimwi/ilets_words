00:00:01.579 --> 00:00:04.720
Hi, I'm Rick Steves, back with more of the
best of Europe.

00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:08.870
This time we're in the home of my Norwegian
ancestors...and I've got a cousin here who

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:10.320
owns a boat!

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:11.320
This is Oslo.

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:44.870
Thanks for joining us.

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:47.960
Oslo is Norway's capital and cultural hub.

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:50.299
Its many attractions tell an exciting story.

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:55.040
They give an insight into a people who, in
a thousand years, have evolved from fearsome

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:59.720
Viking marauders to proud hosts of the Nobel
Peace Prize.

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:04.800
We'll gather with the masses for a concert
atop of Oslo's strikingly modern opera house,

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:14.221
admire the graceful lines of ancient Viking
ships, enjoy some medieval flirting, feel

00:01:14.221 --> 00:01:22.050
the soul of Norway in its National Gallery,
cruise the Oslofjord, and join locals in Europe's

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:25.410
ultimate sculpture park.

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:30.060
For much of its history, Norway was ruled
by other Scandinavian powers - Denmark and

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:31.060
Sweden.

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:35.330
In fact, for 300 years, the city was named
Christiania, after its Danish king.

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:40.780
Then, in 1924, to underscore their independence
from Denmark, locals tossed out that name

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:44.920
and took the Old Norse name...Oslo.

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:51.430
Situated at the head of a 60-mile-long fjord,
Oslo is by far Norway's biggest city.

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:56.320
The city sprawls from a small historic core
to encompass over a million people in its

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:57.909
metropolitan area.

00:01:57.909 --> 00:02:02.390
Nearly one in five Norwegians calls greater
Oslo home.

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:07.870
Its streets are a mix of glassy high-rises,
and - especially in its finer residential

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:11.920
neighborhoods - grand facades.

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:17.890
Oslo's harborfront hums with international
shipping and a thriving cruise industry.

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:25.280
Upscale condominiums enjoy fjord-front settings,
and people here seem to be living very well.

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:31.370
The city's grand boulevard, Karl Johans Gate,
cuts from the train station through the center

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:33.410
of town to the Royal Palace.

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:46.430
It's a people-friendly boulevard, lively with
restaurants, parks, and strolling crowds.

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:50.930
The boulevard is named for the man who built
this palace, Karl Johan.

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:57.349
He was the 19th-century Swedish king who ruled
Norway after Sweden took Norway from Denmark.

00:02:57.349 --> 00:03:04.030
A military parade befitting Norway's modest
military power enlivens the scene.

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:20.560
It ends up at the palace, where people gather
to watch the daily changing of the guard.

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:25.940
While Norway still has its royalty, they are
figureheads tamed by a `constitution`.

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:28.662
Today there's no question - it's the people
who are in charge.

00:03:28.662 --> 00:03:32.160
And they're making their city increasingly
livable.

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:38.450
In the past, you would have dodged several
lanes of traffic to get to the harborfront.

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:43.849
Oslo has made its town center quiet and pedestrian-friendly
by sending most traffic through tunnels under

00:03:43.849 --> 00:03:46.620
the city.

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:51.379
They also levy a traffic-discouraging toll
on cars as they enter town, which subsidizes

00:03:51.379 --> 00:03:57.430
public transport.

00:03:57.430 --> 00:04:01.350
Many European cities are doing the same thing:
tunneling and finding creative ways to help

00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:03.420
fund public transportation.

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:07.430
People are retaking their lakefronts, riverfronts,
and harborfronts.

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:09.960
You can even hear the birds.

00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:13.590
The historic Akershus Fortress overlooks Oslo's
harbor.

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:18.339
While once the menacing place from where Danish
and Swedish overlords kept an eye on the Norwegian

00:04:18.339 --> 00:04:27.210
people, today the fortress seems to oversee
only good times.

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:33.090
While it's still a military base, soldiers
seem only to guard oblivious picnickers.

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:39.960
Cannon-strewn ramparts offer inviting benches
and fine harbor views.

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:44.310
Opposite the fortress, a row of former warehouses
has been transformed into trendy restaurants

00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:46.099
and condos.

00:04:46.099 --> 00:04:50.699
Once a gritty industrial zone, today it's
a vibrant neighborhood enjoyed by residents

00:04:50.699 --> 00:05:00.050
and visitors alike.

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:02.699
Oslo's striking City Hall faces the harbor.

00:05:02.699 --> 00:05:07.879
It was finished in 1950 to celebrate the city's
900th birthday.

00:05:07.879 --> 00:05:12.439
Norway's leading artists all contributed to
what was an avant-garde thrill in its day.

00:05:12.439 --> 00:05:19.439
The statues, which date from the 1930s, celebrate
the nobility of the working class.

00:05:19.439 --> 00:05:26.940
The art, which shows everyone working together,
implies a classless society.

00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:33.059
Inside, the grand hall is famous for hosting
the Nobel Peace Prize ceremony.

00:05:33.059 --> 00:05:37.759
Entering here, I'm reminded that in this most
highly taxed corner of Europe, city halls,

00:05:37.759 --> 00:05:41.119
rather than churches, are the dominant buildings.

00:05:41.119 --> 00:05:45.080
While the state religion is Lutheran, people
rarely go to church.

00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:49.220
Instead, they seem to almost worship good
government.

00:05:49.220 --> 00:05:53.180
In fact, this main hall actually feels like
a temple.

00:05:53.180 --> 00:06:00.520
The altar-like mural celebrates family values,
good citizenship, and civic administration.

00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:05.979
The mural shows both town folk and country
folk - people from all classes and all walks

00:06:05.979 --> 00:06:06.979
of life.

00:06:06.979 --> 00:06:11.339
Together, despite their differences, they're
collaborating with a determination to build

00:06:11.339 --> 00:06:16.870
a better society.

00:06:16.870 --> 00:06:21.130
This art illustrates how Norwegians are comfortable
with their more socialistic form of government.

00:06:21.130 --> 00:06:26.110
They pay high taxes, have high expectations
of their government, and are generally satisfied

00:06:26.110 --> 00:06:28.710
with how their leaders spend their money.

00:06:28.710 --> 00:06:34.099
Oslo's harborfront provides an inviting place
to simply enjoy the urban scene between sightseeing

00:06:34.099 --> 00:06:35.649
stops.

00:06:35.649 --> 00:06:41.120
From there, a ferry shuttles visitors across
the harbor to BygdÃ¸y, a peninsula with several

00:06:41.120 --> 00:06:45.119
museums highlighting the nation's maritime
history.

00:06:45.119 --> 00:06:50.539
The Viking Ship Museum shows off ninth-century
Viking ships - icons from those days of pillage

00:06:50.539 --> 00:06:53.159
and plunder.

00:06:53.159 --> 00:06:56.189
Norwegian marauders terrorized Europe for
generations.

00:06:56.189 --> 00:07:01.210
Gazing up at the prow of one of these sleek
vessels, you can imagine the horror peasants

00:07:01.210 --> 00:07:09.620
in France or England or Russia felt when those
redheads on the rampage sailed up their river.

00:07:09.620 --> 00:07:14.590
Over a thousand years ago, three things drove
Vikings on their far-flung raids: hard economic

00:07:14.590 --> 00:07:19.120
times in their bleak homeland; the lure of
prosperous and vulnerable communities to the

00:07:19.120 --> 00:07:21.749
south; and a mastery of the sea.

00:07:21.749 --> 00:07:27.080
In a boat like this - finely crafted of oak
- the Vikings ranged far and wide.

00:07:27.080 --> 00:07:31.249
They settled over a thousand miles away in
the west of France, which became Normandy

00:07:31.249 --> 00:07:33.159
- named for those Norsemen.

00:07:33.159 --> 00:07:37.999
And they hop-scotched across the Atlantic
from Iceland to Greenland and on to the east

00:07:37.999 --> 00:07:41.430
coast of Canada, which they called Vinland.

00:07:41.430 --> 00:07:47.370
Imagine 30 men hauling on long oars, muscling
through the sea for weeks and months on end.

00:07:47.370 --> 00:07:53.330
In 1892, a replica of this ship sailed to
America in 44 days - to celebrate the 400th

00:07:53.330 --> 00:07:58.599
anniversary of Columbus not discovering America.

00:07:58.599 --> 00:08:02.789
This ship, with its well-designed rudder and
intricate carving, was probably a ceremonial

00:08:02.789 --> 00:08:09.029
pleasure craft for royalty to promenade on
calm waters.

00:08:09.029 --> 00:08:11.969
Viking chieftains were buried in their ships
with their possessions.

00:08:11.969 --> 00:08:19.219
In fact, that's why these particular ships
survived.

00:08:19.219 --> 00:08:30.129
Excavations turned up artifacts of leather
and finely carved wood like these ornate sleighs.

00:08:30.129 --> 00:08:43.690
This horse cart is decorated with fanciful
scenes from old Viking sagas.

00:08:43.690 --> 00:08:48.310
An adjacent museum houses another Norwegian
ship, the Fram.

00:08:48.310 --> 00:08:53.120
A thousand years after the Vikings, the steam-
and sail-powered Fram took modern-day explorers

00:08:53.120 --> 00:08:59.130
Amundsen and Nansen deep into both polar regions.

00:08:59.130 --> 00:09:05.430
This tough ship ventured both farther north
and south than any ship had gone before.

00:09:05.430 --> 00:09:11.790
Exhibits help you imagine life in these extremes,
so far from the safety and comforts of civilization.

00:09:11.790 --> 00:09:16.950
For three years, this boat - especially designed
to survive the pressure of a frozen sea - was

00:09:16.950 --> 00:09:21.610
locked in the grip of the Arctic ice.

00:09:21.610 --> 00:09:24.750
The Fram was well equipped with instruments
for scientific research.

00:09:24.750 --> 00:09:29.460
State-of-the-art in the early 1900s, these
tools enabled the explorers to bring back

00:09:29.460 --> 00:09:38.470
important new data from the polar frontiers.

00:09:38.470 --> 00:09:43.650
Next to the Fram is another example of Norway's
seafaring heritage: the Kon-Tiki.

00:09:43.650 --> 00:09:50.630
In 1947, the Norwegian explorer Thor Heyerdahl
and his crew constructed the Kon-Tiki raft

00:09:50.630 --> 00:09:52.600
out of bamboo and balsa wood.

00:09:52.600 --> 00:09:57.610
They set sail from Peru on the crude and fragile
craft, surviving for 101 days on fish, coconuts,

00:09:57.610 --> 00:10:00.190
and sweet potatoes.

00:10:00.190 --> 00:10:10.740
About 4,300 miles later, they landed in Polynesia.

00:10:10.740 --> 00:10:15.770
The point of this expedition was to show that
early South Americans could have settled Polynesia.

00:10:15.770 --> 00:10:20.600
While Heyerdahl proved they could have, anthropologists
doubt they actually did.

00:10:20.600 --> 00:10:26.550
Today, with this idyllic fjordside setting,
locals seem content not to sail far away...but

00:10:26.550 --> 00:10:32.690
to simply enjoy the delightful setting of
the city they call home.

00:10:32.690 --> 00:10:36.550
And for the people of Oslo, their fjord is
a natural wonderland.

00:10:36.550 --> 00:10:41.670
Many choose to live in peaceful island communities,
just an easy commute from downtown.

00:10:41.670 --> 00:10:43.070
Others see it as a playground.

00:10:43.070 --> 00:10:48.360
My cousin Kari-Anne and her partner Knut are
picking us up for a short cruise.

00:10:48.360 --> 00:10:53.920
Within minutes, Oslo is a world away, and
we're surrounded by the beauty of its fjord.

00:10:53.920 --> 00:10:59.380
Islands provide a quick escape for commuters,
vacationers, kayakers, and campers.

00:10:59.380 --> 00:11:04.180
While locals love to zip off in their boats,
even tourists can hop on a ferry to enjoy

00:11:04.180 --> 00:11:07.940
much of the same experience.

00:11:07.940 --> 00:11:11.220
We're anchoring in a charming cove only about
10 minutes from the city.

00:11:11.220 --> 00:11:13.850
Rick: So it's the perfect escape, Oslofjord.

00:11:13.850 --> 00:11:16.580
Kari-Anne: Very nice resort for everybody.

00:11:16.580 --> 00:11:22.150
Rick: When a tourist comes to Norway, we kind
of think "expensive" and "high taxes."

00:11:22.150 --> 00:11:30.850
Kari-Anne: But we also have a thorough social
democratic principle where the idea is that

00:11:30.850 --> 00:11:33.040
the basic things should be free for everybody.

00:11:33.040 --> 00:11:38.840
Rick: Now a normal American worker pays probably
30 percent of their income in taxes, I think.

00:11:38.840 --> 00:11:40.200
What would a worker...?

00:11:40.200 --> 00:11:42.640
Kari-Anne: Generally would be around 50 percent.

00:11:42.640 --> 00:11:48.200
Rick: OK, but if you add in the cost of education
to send your kids to college, and health care

00:11:48.200 --> 00:11:49.200
in America...

00:11:49.200 --> 00:11:50.200
Kari-Anne: It would probably be the same.

00:11:50.200 --> 00:11:51.200
Rick: Probably the same.

00:11:51.200 --> 00:11:56.250
But does this idealism `demoralize` people from
being innovative and working really hard to

00:11:56.250 --> 00:11:57.250
get ahead?

00:11:57.250 --> 00:12:02.280
Knut: I think it is the opposite, because
you have security in the bottom, and then

00:12:02.280 --> 00:12:06.550
you can actually have creativity and productivity
based upon that.

00:12:06.550 --> 00:12:09.560
Rick: I'm sure it's not perfect, but all in
all, do you like the system?

00:12:09.560 --> 00:12:11.600
Kari-Anne: I'm convinced that it's a good
idea.

00:12:11.600 --> 00:12:15.470
I mean politically, it's a basic idea I believe
in.

00:12:15.470 --> 00:12:18.940
And of course it can always be better.

00:12:18.940 --> 00:12:25.200
But I think the best thing is you're free
from the kind of anxiety that I have a feeling

00:12:25.200 --> 00:12:33.720
many Americans feel - that, um, "How can I
afford to go to hospital in case I get ill?

00:12:33.720 --> 00:12:38.740
What happens when I get old if I don't have
the money to stay in a nice place?", for instance.

00:12:38.740 --> 00:12:41.820
All these things are more or less taken care
of in this system.

00:12:41.820 --> 00:12:46.810
Wherever I travel, it's stimulating to learn
about different social systems that confound

00:12:46.810 --> 00:12:48.970
many Americans.

00:12:48.970 --> 00:12:51.880
But life wasn't always a picnic on the fjord.

00:12:51.880 --> 00:12:57.460
The Norwegian Folk Museum takes us back to
a day when life was more of a struggle.

00:12:57.460 --> 00:13:02.780
It displays 150 traditional buildings brought
here from all corners of the country and reassembled

00:13:02.780 --> 00:13:06.600
in this sprawling park.

00:13:06.600 --> 00:13:12.910
The museum is alive with people demonstrating
slices of folk life.

00:13:12.910 --> 00:13:20.980
Smartly crafted log construction and sod-roofs
were well-designed for the long, cold winters.

00:13:20.980 --> 00:13:29.170
Stepping inside, you get a tasty example of
life back then - these women are making the

00:13:29.170 --> 00:13:35.170
old-fashioned lefse.

00:13:35.170 --> 00:13:38.470
Christianity came to Norway back in Viking
times.

00:13:38.470 --> 00:13:42.850
Builders employed their expert woodworking
skills - evident in their shipbuilding - to

00:13:42.850 --> 00:13:45.230
make fine wooden stave churches.

00:13:45.230 --> 00:13:50.060
They're named for the staves, or upright posts,
upon which they're built.

00:13:50.060 --> 00:13:55.290
While `commonplace` in 12th-century Norway,
only a few of these churches survive.

00:13:55.290 --> 00:13:59.100
And every hour through the day, a crowd gathers
at this farm hamlet from the northern region

00:13:59.100 --> 00:14:01.750
of Telemark to enjoy folk music and dance.

00:14:01.750 --> 00:14:06.440
With the very strict social constraints of
centuries past, folk dances were an acceptable

00:14:06.440 --> 00:14:33.420
way for boys and girls to flirt and strut
their stuff.

00:14:33.420 --> 00:14:36.560
Back in the center, we take a short walk from
downtown.

00:14:36.560 --> 00:14:40.900
Leaving the tourist attractions behind, you
connect a little more intimately with the

00:14:40.900 --> 00:14:42.030
city.

00:14:42.030 --> 00:14:47.070
The national graveyard is a well-tended oasis
of peace, where many of the country's cultural

00:14:47.070 --> 00:14:49.360
greats are buried.

00:14:49.360 --> 00:14:53.220
It leads to Oslo's oldest still-standing building.

00:14:53.220 --> 00:15:01.340
The 12th-century Gamle Aker church was built
in the stark Romanesque style.

00:15:01.340 --> 00:15:07.850
The power of the stonework seems to echo the
force of medieval Christianity - a force that

00:15:07.850 --> 00:15:18.570
was necessary to tame those Vikings, turning
them from pagan raiders into Christian farmers.

00:15:18.570 --> 00:15:23.250
From the church, a quaint lane leads down
to the Akers River.

00:15:23.250 --> 00:15:26.340
It's lined by a delightful row of wooden cottages.

00:15:26.340 --> 00:15:31.300
Because of Oslo's many devastating fires over
the centuries, you won't see architecture

00:15:31.300 --> 00:15:36.570
like this in the town center.

00:15:36.570 --> 00:15:42.490
The Akers River park is a favorite of dog-walkers
and joggers.

00:15:42.490 --> 00:15:47.860
While tranquil today, its waterfalls once
powered a series of mills, which drove Oslo's

00:15:47.860 --> 00:15:54.800
early industry: flour mills in the 1300s,
sawmills in the 1500s, and Norway's Industrial

00:15:54.800 --> 00:15:58.980
Revolution in the 1800s.

00:15:58.980 --> 00:16:03.320
These women laborers are pondering the textile
factory where they and hundreds like them

00:16:03.320 --> 00:16:08.339
toiled long and hard...not even dreaming of
the good life women just a century later would

00:16:08.339 --> 00:16:14.730
enjoy in this same city.

00:16:14.730 --> 00:16:19.000
This former working-class district, called
GrÃ¼nerlÃ¸kka, is now a favorite of Oslo's

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:21.690
creative and bohemian set.

00:16:21.690 --> 00:16:27.620
Locals come here for its convivial night scene,
colorful eateries, and mellow cafÃ©s.

00:16:27.620 --> 00:16:37.170
And at the edge of GrÃ¼nerlÃ¸kka is a neighborhood
that reflects Oslo's changing ethnic complexion.

00:16:37.170 --> 00:16:40.710
Like much of Europe, the people of Oslo are
learning to share their city with a growing

00:16:40.710 --> 00:16:42.630
immigrant population.

00:16:42.630 --> 00:16:46.800
One in five of Oslo's citizens are not ethnic
Norwegians.

00:16:46.800 --> 00:16:51.800
These "new Norwegians" have provided a much-needed
and generally appreciated labor force, filling

00:16:51.800 --> 00:16:55.660
jobs that wealthy Norwegians would rather
not do.

00:16:55.660 --> 00:16:58.670
Immigrants are critical in the booming construction
industry.

00:16:58.670 --> 00:17:04.400
Cab companies, restaurants, and hotels are
increasingly dependent on these workers.

00:17:04.400 --> 00:17:09.289
And entrepreneurial immigrants have opened
successful shops and popular ethnic restaurants,

00:17:09.289 --> 00:17:15.039
literally adding spice to the otherwise pretty
drab local cuisine.

00:17:15.039 --> 00:17:20.130
Modern Norway is a fast-changing scene - both
ethnically and architecturally.

00:17:20.130 --> 00:17:24.770
Oslo's striking Opera House, built of Carrara
marble, seems to rise like an iceberg from

00:17:24.770 --> 00:17:25.770
the sea.

00:17:25.770 --> 00:17:30.639
This is the only opera house in the world
that doubles as a public plaza, with a roof

00:17:30.639 --> 00:17:37.529
designed to be walked on.

00:17:37.529 --> 00:17:47.690
Built on a once-gritty industrial zone, traffic
was re-directed underground, and today the

00:17:47.690 --> 00:17:51.220
city enjoys a popular new cultural venue.

00:17:51.220 --> 00:17:52.929
It's a huge hit.

00:17:52.929 --> 00:17:58.629
Its roof doubles as a grandstand for outdoor
concerts.

00:17:58.629 --> 00:18:03.030
And its striking interior comes with all the
elegance you'd expect.

00:18:03.030 --> 00:18:08.400
Concert-goers gather in its soaring lobby.

00:18:08.400 --> 00:18:12.879
The `acoustics` in this state-of-the-art theater
are considered some of the best anywhere - and

00:18:12.879 --> 00:18:24.179
Oslo's Jazz Festival takes full advantage.

00:18:24.179 --> 00:18:29.270
In this distant corner of Europe, many visitors
find more high culture than they expect.

00:18:29.270 --> 00:18:34.039
Norway's National Gallery showcases the powerful
beauty of this country's landscape and people

00:18:34.039 --> 00:18:36.909
as portrayed by its great painters.

00:18:36.909 --> 00:18:40.860
A thoughtful visit here gives those heading
into the mountains and fjord country a chance

00:18:40.860 --> 00:18:45.809
to pack along a little better understanding
of Norway's cultural soul.

00:18:45.809 --> 00:18:49.409
Landscapes have always played an important
role in Norwegian art.

00:18:49.409 --> 00:18:53.840
This genre peaked in the late 19th century,
during the Romantic period, which stressed

00:18:53.840 --> 00:18:56.710
the power and beauty of nature.

00:18:56.710 --> 00:19:03.619
Stalheim, by Johan Christian Dahl, epitomizes
the Norwegian closeness to nature.

00:19:03.619 --> 00:19:06.769
Romantics reveled in the power of the great
outdoors.

00:19:06.769 --> 00:19:11.600
The rainbow says it all: This is God's work.

00:19:11.600 --> 00:19:12.940
Nature is big.

00:19:12.940 --> 00:19:14.070
God is great.

00:19:14.070 --> 00:19:20.419
Man is small.

00:19:20.419 --> 00:19:25.399
The birch tree - standing boldly front and
center - is a standard symbol for the politically

00:19:25.399 --> 00:19:31.400
downtrodden Norwegian people: battered yet
still standing.

00:19:31.400 --> 00:19:36.160
In the mid-19th century, Norwegians were awakening
to their national identity.

00:19:36.160 --> 00:19:43.059
The Bridal Voyage shows the ultimate Norwegian
scene: a wedding party with everyone decked

00:19:43.059 --> 00:19:47.759
out in their traditional dress, heading for
the stave church, `engulfed` in the majesty

00:19:47.759 --> 00:19:50.190
of the fjords.

00:19:50.190 --> 00:19:56.210
Here, and throughout Europe, nationalism and
Romanticism went hand-in-hand.

00:19:56.210 --> 00:19:59.679
These were hardworking, independent folk.

00:19:59.679 --> 00:20:02.960
People were poor...but they owned their own
land.

00:20:02.960 --> 00:20:07.299
Paintings like these were patriotic tools.

00:20:07.299 --> 00:20:12.909
This painting - Low Church Devotion by Tidemand,
from 1848 - shows a dissenting Lutheran church

00:20:12.909 --> 00:20:17.360
group (of which there were many in the 19th
century).

00:20:17.360 --> 00:20:21.590
Rather than accept the Norwegian king's "High
Church," they worshipped independently, in

00:20:21.590 --> 00:20:23.149
a humble home.

00:20:23.149 --> 00:20:27.580
The light of God powers through the chimney,
illuminating salt-of-the-earth people with

00:20:27.580 --> 00:20:28.999
strong faiths.

00:20:28.999 --> 00:20:35.009
Later, many of these same people emigrated
to America for greater religious freedom.

00:20:35.009 --> 00:20:41.059
Edvard Munch is Norway's most famous and influential
painter.

00:20:41.059 --> 00:20:46.710
In this 1895 self-portrait, we see a complex
and troubled artist.

00:20:46.710 --> 00:20:52.919
Munch helped pioneer a new style - Expressionism
- using lurid colors and bold lines to "express"

00:20:52.919 --> 00:21:01.440
inner turmoil and the angst of the modern
world.

00:21:01.440 --> 00:21:04.649
The Scream is Munch's most iconic work.

00:21:04.649 --> 00:21:09.330
The figure seems isolated from the people
on the bridge - locked up in himself, unable

00:21:09.330 --> 00:21:11.019
to stifle his scream.

00:21:11.019 --> 00:21:16.389
Munch wrote, "This painting is the work of
a madman."

00:21:16.389 --> 00:21:23.549
This Expressionist masterpiece is a breakthrough
painting showing angst personified.

00:21:23.549 --> 00:21:28.039
Munch suffered from depression.

00:21:28.039 --> 00:21:29.919
His father had a mental breakdown.

00:21:29.919 --> 00:21:32.519
His mother and his sister died of TB.

00:21:32.519 --> 00:21:35.989
When he eventually overcame his depression,
he became a happier man.

00:21:35.989 --> 00:21:38.450
But he never again painted with such power.

00:21:38.450 --> 00:21:45.379
But today, especially when the sun shines
in Oslo, it's really not that bad.

00:21:45.379 --> 00:21:50.940
Wherever I travel, I like to think of public
transportation routes as potential tour routes.

00:21:50.940 --> 00:21:53.380
Oslo's main tram line circles around the city.

00:21:53.380 --> 00:21:57.679
You can hop on and off, knowing another is
always on its way.

00:21:57.679 --> 00:22:02.269
Trams come by about every 10 minutes, efficiently
and economically lacing together many of the

00:22:02.269 --> 00:22:05.929
city's most important sights.

00:22:05.929 --> 00:22:12.460
Oslo's vast Frogner Park is a perfect place
to share a moment with Norwegians families

00:22:12.460 --> 00:22:16.169
at play.

00:22:16.169 --> 00:22:25.429
Strolling here, you feel a positive spirit
- both `rugged` and `pragmatic`, celebrating life.

00:22:25.429 --> 00:22:31.700
The park showcases a lifetime of work by Oslo's
greatest sculptor, Gustav Vigeland.

00:22:31.700 --> 00:22:37.669
In 1921, Vigeland made a deal with the city:
In return for a great studio and financial

00:22:37.669 --> 00:22:43.049
support, he agreed to dedicate his creative
life to beautifying Oslo with all these statues,

00:22:43.049 --> 00:22:45.869
which became this much-loved sculpture garden.

00:22:45.869 --> 00:22:53.179
From 1924 to 1943, he created a world of bronze
and granite statues comprising 600 figures,

00:22:53.179 --> 00:22:56.440
each nude and unique.

00:22:56.440 --> 00:23:04.230
Vigeland's sturdy humans capture universal
themes of the cycle of life.

00:23:04.230 --> 00:23:07.960
Today Vigeland's park is beloved by the people
of Oslo.

00:23:07.960 --> 00:23:12.260
It's both a place to relax...and a place to
be inspired.

00:23:12.260 --> 00:23:17.559
Six giants hold a fountain, symbolically toiling
with the burden of life, as water - the source

00:23:17.559 --> 00:23:22.230
of life - cascades steadily over them.

00:23:22.230 --> 00:23:27.669
In clumps of bronze trees, Vigeland takes
us through the seasons of life.

00:23:27.669 --> 00:23:32.320
The centerpiece of the park - a teeming monolith
of life surrounded by granite groups - continues

00:23:32.320 --> 00:23:37.020
Vigeland's cycle-of-life motif.

00:23:37.020 --> 00:23:42.100
Vigeland explores a lifetime of human relationships
in earthbound groups.

00:23:42.100 --> 00:23:46.379
The figures seem irresistible, as visitors
playfully engage with the art.

00:23:46.379 --> 00:23:54.580
Then, at the center, a tangle of figures carved
out of a single block of stone rockets skyward.

00:23:54.580 --> 00:23:58.220
Built of bodies, it seems to pick up speed
as it spirals skyward.

00:23:58.220 --> 00:24:02.900
Vigeland left the meaning of his monolith
itself open.

00:24:02.900 --> 00:24:06.980
Like life itself, it's a wonderful puzzle.

00:24:06.980 --> 00:24:11.210
I hope you've enjoyed our visit to Oslo.

00:24:11.210 --> 00:24:16.869
Like these Vigeland statues, Oslo itself can
inspire us to celebrate life in all its complexity,

00:24:16.869 --> 00:24:18.519
and to embrace it.

00:24:18.519 --> 00:24:19.659
Thanks for joining us.

00:24:19.659 --> 00:24:20.679
I'm Rick Steves.

00:24:20.679 --> 00:24:23.629
Until next time...keep on travelin'.

00:24:23.629 --> 00:24:24.629
Credits:

00:24:24.629 --> 00:24:29.501
People who in a thousand years have evolved
from fearsome marauding Vikings to people

00:24:29.501 --> 00:24:30.899
like me [laugh].

00:24:30.899 --> 00:24:37.429
And are generally comfortable, satisfied,
pleased with how their leaders spend their

00:24:37.429 --> 00:24:38.429
money.

00:24:38.429 --> 00:24:42.019
The point of this `expedition` was to show that
early South Americans could have pollinated

00:24:42.019 --> 00:24:50.209
[laugh].
