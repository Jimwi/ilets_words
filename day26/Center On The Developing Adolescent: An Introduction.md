00:00:00.132 --> 00:00:03.424
(gentle music)

00:00:03.424 --> 00:00:05.387
- Welcome, it's exciting
to share the launch

00:00:05.387 --> 00:00:07.436
of our Center on the
Developing Adolescent.

00:00:07.436 --> 00:00:09.545
This Center is the
outgrowth of years of effort

00:00:09.545 --> 00:00:12.057
and intellectual
contributions from many people

00:00:12.057 --> 00:00:14.220
coming together into a shared vision.

00:00:14.220 --> 00:00:16.236
This vision focuses on achieving a deeper

00:00:16.236 --> 00:00:18.159
understanding of adolescence
as a developmental

00:00:18.159 --> 00:00:20.718
period of vulnerabilities
and opportunities

00:00:20.718 --> 00:00:23.582
and using this knowledge to
improve the lives of youth.

00:00:23.582 --> 00:00:25.859
The mission of our Center
is to advance understanding

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:28.326
of adolescence through
innovative transdisciplinary

00:00:28.326 --> 00:00:29.632
developmental science.

00:00:30.227 --> 00:00:31.826
To advance this mission, we believe that

00:00:31.826 --> 00:00:34.928
integrative team science
approaches are needed.

00:00:34.928 --> 00:00:37.646
Exciting advances in
neuroscience must be integrated

00:00:37.646 --> 00:00:39.840
with the expertise and
developmental science,

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:42.128
psychological science, affective science,

00:00:42.128 --> 00:00:45.576
as well as clinical, social,
educational, public health

00:00:45.576 --> 00:00:48.563
policy, and cultural
perspectives on adolescence.

00:00:49.551 --> 00:00:52.661
This requires a team of teams,
innovative partnerships,

00:00:52.661 --> 00:00:54.382
networks, and collaborations.

00:00:55.176 --> 00:00:58.331
Our aims are to promote and
support transdisciplinary

00:00:58.331 --> 00:01:00.630
research networks, research partnerships,

00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:03.692
and research activities that
integrate multiple levels

00:01:03.692 --> 00:01:05.810
of understanding of
adolescent development.

00:01:06.407 --> 00:01:09.165
Our Center emphasizes a
team science approach.

00:01:09.165 --> 00:01:12.310
We incorporate expertise
spanning basic areas

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:14.577
of developmental science,
social, affective,

00:01:14.577 --> 00:01:16.593
and cognitive neuroscience as well as

00:01:16.593 --> 00:01:18.776
clinical, educational, public health,

00:01:18.776 --> 00:01:22.061
cultural, social, and global
perspectives on adolescence.

00:01:23.379 --> 00:01:25.489
We have a strong interest in understanding

00:01:25.489 --> 00:01:27.788
how social and emotional experiences shape

00:01:27.788 --> 00:01:31.320
key developing biological
systems during adolescence.

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:33.679
We also promote and
support training activities

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:34.961
aligned with this mission.

00:01:35.619 --> 00:01:38.221
Our Center aims to serve
as a hub of integration

00:01:38.221 --> 00:01:39.988
of cutting edge developmental science

00:01:39.988 --> 00:01:41.857
from leading researchers and collaborators

00:01:41.857 --> 00:01:44.067
who are advancing
understanding of adolescence.

00:01:44.987 --> 00:01:46.993
Some of the early roots
of these ideas go back

00:01:46.993 --> 00:01:49.271
to a scientific conference in 2003

00:01:49.271 --> 00:01:51.433
hosted by The New York Academy of Sciences

00:01:51.433 --> 00:01:53.554
entitled Adolescent Brain Development,

00:01:53.554 --> 00:01:56.000
a Period of Vulnerabilities
and Opportunities.

00:01:56.293 --> 00:01:58.184
This meeting brought
together an impressively

00:01:58.184 --> 00:02:00.885
diverse group of
scientists, young scholars,

00:02:00.885 --> 00:02:03.465
clinicians, policy
makers, and stakeholders

00:02:03.465 --> 00:02:06.914
interested in adolescence
into an integrative

00:02:06.914 --> 00:02:09.469
interdisciplinary
discussion stretching from

00:02:09.469 --> 00:02:12.101
basic neuroscience to
policy level questions.

00:02:12.101 --> 00:02:13.449
It was inspiring.

00:02:13.449 --> 00:02:16.512
It generated a great deal of excitement.

00:02:16.512 --> 00:02:18.725
Over the ensuing 12
years, the field has grown

00:02:18.725 --> 00:02:20.216
at an explosive rate.

00:02:20.488 --> 00:02:23.363
Scores of conferences,
thousands of scientific papers

00:02:23.363 --> 00:02:26.173
ranging from basic research,
developmental, cognitive,

00:02:26.173 --> 00:02:29.306
affective, and social
neuroscience, psychology,

00:02:29.306 --> 00:02:32.222
issues of sociology, legal
justice, and policy level

00:02:32.222 --> 00:02:33.769
issues of adolescence.

00:02:33.769 --> 00:02:36.902
Now, there's broad recognition
across scientific disciplines

00:02:36.902 --> 00:02:39.065
as well as public
understanding of the importance

00:02:39.065 --> 00:02:42.449
of adolescence as a high-impact
maturational period.

00:02:42.754 --> 00:02:44.854
A complex time of dramatic changes,

00:02:44.854 --> 00:02:47.160
learning, development, and plasticity

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:49.948
in ways that create
risks and opportunities.

00:02:50.147 --> 00:02:52.750
And with lifelong impact
on health, education,

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:55.859
well-being, and social as
well as economic success.

00:02:56.582 --> 00:02:58.974
There's also growing
recognition of the importance

00:02:58.974 --> 00:03:01.255
of adolescence from a global perspective.

00:03:01.924 --> 00:03:03.763
The rapid gains over the past decade

00:03:03.763 --> 00:03:05.339
from global efforts to improve the lives

00:03:05.339 --> 00:03:06.928
of women, infants, and children

00:03:06.928 --> 00:03:09.142
are now being extended
to include adolescents

00:03:09.142 --> 00:03:10.597
for compelling reasons.

00:03:11.245 --> 00:03:13.618
Unprecedented changes in human demography,

00:03:13.618 --> 00:03:16.573
population, mobility,
global communications,

00:03:16.573 --> 00:03:19.112
economic development, and
the digital revolution

00:03:19.112 --> 00:03:22.530
are creating unique
vulnerabilities and opportunities

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:25.715
for the largest generation of
adolescents in human history.

00:03:26.468 --> 00:03:28.559
Developmental science has
important contributions

00:03:28.559 --> 00:03:31.076
to make relevant to
these high-stake issues.

00:03:31.599 --> 00:03:33.239
We are at an early point of understanding

00:03:33.239 --> 00:03:35.265
this exciting scientific frontier.

00:03:36.102 --> 00:03:39.194
There is enormous complexity
and great challenges.

00:03:39.863 --> 00:03:42.349
This developmental bridge
between childhood and adulthood

00:03:42.349 --> 00:03:44.993
encompasses a dramatic set
of physical, emotional,

00:03:44.993 --> 00:03:46.695
cognitive, and social changes

00:03:46.695 --> 00:03:48.931
and interactions across these levels,

00:03:48.931 --> 00:03:50.425
many of which are only beginning

00:03:50.425 --> 00:03:52.129
to be understood scientifically.

00:03:52.819 --> 00:03:54.115
To help address these challenges

00:03:54.115 --> 00:03:55.734
and complexities, we have organized

00:03:55.734 --> 00:03:57.801
the Center on the Developing Adolescent.

00:03:58.199 --> 00:03:59.694
We seek opportunities to promote

00:03:59.694 --> 00:04:01.689
intellectual exchanges
that help to integrate

00:04:01.689 --> 00:04:04.051
understanding across
levels in disciplines,

00:04:04.051 --> 00:04:05.795
contribute to advancing and refining

00:04:05.795 --> 00:04:08.386
`transdisciplinary` `heuristic` models,

00:04:08.386 --> 00:04:10.539
and contribute to
designing and carrying out

00:04:10.539 --> 00:04:13.276
studies to test key
features of these models.

00:04:14.039 --> 00:04:15.744
We support collaborative networking

00:04:15.744 --> 00:04:17.676
to promote the sharing
of methods, measures,

00:04:17.676 --> 00:04:19.567
tasks, and findings.

00:04:19.567 --> 00:04:22.608
We promote innovation and
translational activities

00:04:22.608 --> 00:04:25.230
and interdisciplinary
exchanges relevant to providers

00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:27.915
in clinical, educational,
and public health settings.

00:04:28.845 --> 00:04:31.228
We place a high priority on contributing

00:04:31.228 --> 00:04:32.973
to the training of
students and young scholars

00:04:32.973 --> 00:04:36.190
who want to become part
of transdisciplinary

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:38.676
team research focusing on adolescence.

00:04:39.554 --> 00:04:41.507
We partner with other teams,

00:04:41.507 --> 00:04:43.106
teams working at different levels.

00:04:43.734 --> 00:04:45.677
Our Center includes a
number of overlapping

00:04:45.677 --> 00:04:47.714
and interrelated research
teams, partnerships,

00:04:47.714 --> 00:04:48.843
and research networks,

00:04:48.843 --> 00:04:50.524
each with their own leadership structure

00:04:50.524 --> 00:04:52.416
that extend across the
University of California

00:04:52.416 --> 00:04:54.108
system as well as several other

00:04:54.108 --> 00:04:56.605
universities in the U.S.
and internationally.

00:04:57.672 --> 00:04:59.767
Our long term goals through partnering

00:04:59.767 --> 00:05:02.285
are to identify
policy-relevant opportunities

00:05:02.285 --> 00:05:04.353
for improving the
developmental trajectories

00:05:04.353 --> 00:05:07.497
of health, education, and
well-being among youth.

00:05:08.145 --> 00:05:09.912
We believe a deeper understanding

00:05:09.912 --> 00:05:11.689
of the developmental
science of adolescence

00:05:11.689 --> 00:05:14.376
will provide new leverage
points for early intervention

00:05:14.376 --> 00:05:17.070
and prevention efforts
and innovative approaches

00:05:17.070 --> 00:05:19.558
to education and positive
youth development.

00:05:19.937 --> 00:05:20.830
Thank you.
