00:00:01.579 --> 00:00:07.569
The self-proclaimed Islamic State dramatically
rose from obscurity in 2014 when it split

00:00:07.569 --> 00:00:13.320
from al-Qaeda, seized territory in Iraq and
Syria, and established what it describes as

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:17.020
a caliphate governed by strict sharia law.

00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:22.810
The Islamic State views non-Muslims and any
Muslim who does not accept its rule as enemies.

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:27.490
It has recruited foreign fighters from around
the world, and inspired pledges of allegiance

00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:32.770
by jihadist groups from Libya to Pakistan
to Nigeria.

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:38.260
The group is fighting against all other factions
in the ongoing civil war in Syria, which has

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:43.089
displaced half the country’s population
causing a refugee crisis in the region and

00:00:43.089 --> 00:00:44.440
in Europe.

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:49.839
The United States is concerned about the Islamic
State’s control of territory and population

00:00:49.839 --> 00:00:54.110
in the heart of the Middle East, and about
its ability to both carry out attacks and

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:58.550
inspire them elsewhere in the world, including
in the U.S. homeland.

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:03.850
The United States is already taking some steps
to roll back the Islamic State and restrict

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:10.080
its resources and recruits, including airstrikes,
arming and training local partners, and dispatching

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:13.580
military advisors and special operations forces.

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:17.820
The next president will face tough decisions
in confronting the Islamic State:

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:23.930
Troops on the ground -- There is an ongoing
debate about whether the United States should

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:28.130
commit significant ground forces against the
Islamic State.

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:32.930
The worry is that it may lead to another protracted
and costly military engagement in the Middle

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:37.040
East, with no clear exit strategy.

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:42.570
Arming the Kurds -- In both Iraq and Syria,
Kurdish forces have been the most effective

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:45.800
local partners against the Islamic State.

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:52.070
But greater support for Syrian Kurds presents
a dilemma because Turkey -- a NATO ally -- considers

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:53.920
them as terrorists.

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:59.190
And greater support for Iraqi Kurds may increase
the likelihood of an independent Kurdish state

00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:03.630
– which Iraq, Turkey, Syria, and Iran oppose.

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:09.929
The next president will have to decide how
much to support Kurdish forces.

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:11.460
What about Assad?

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:16.810
– The fight against the Islamic State is
intertwined with the civil war in Syria.

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:22.020
As long as President Bashar al-Assad remains
in power it inspires support for the Islamic

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:23.430
State.

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:28.620
But Assad is backed by Russia and Iran, and
influential countries are deeply divided on

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:31.470
whether and when to press for his departure.

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:36.660
The president will have to decide what negotiated
solution the United States is prepared to

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:41.319
live with, and whether to provide greater
military support for local Sunni partners

00:02:41.319 --> 00:02:44.920
who seek to `oust` Assad.

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:49.370
The battle against the Islamic State will
have to be calibrated with a host of interconnected

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:54.930
regional challenges, including the sectarian
strif
e in Iraq, spillover into neighboring

00:02:54.930 --> 00:03:00.810
Turkey, Kurdish desires for independence,
tensions between Iran and Saudi Arabia, and

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:04.180
Russia’s renewed assertiveness.

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:08.640
The next president will have to make decisions
that will affect U.S. policy not just in the

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:10.640
Middle East but around the world.
