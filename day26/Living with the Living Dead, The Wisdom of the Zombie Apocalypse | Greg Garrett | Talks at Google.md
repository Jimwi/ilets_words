00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.940
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:07.480
GREG GARRETT: Thank you.

00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:08.424
Thank you so much.

00:00:08.424 --> 00:00:09.340
How is everyone today?

00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:10.951
AUDIENCE: Pretty good.

00:00:10.951 --> 00:00:11.950
GREG GARRETT: Brilliant.

00:00:11.950 --> 00:00:13.900
I bring greetings from
Austin, the live music

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:14.790
capital of the world.

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:16.248
I had to get a
special dispensation

00:00:16.248 --> 00:00:18.332
to come without a guitar today.

00:00:18.332 --> 00:00:20.290
Otherwise you are penalized
when you come back,

00:00:20.290 --> 00:00:23.050
and you have to sort of
walk the walk of shame

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:24.370
down Congress Avenue.

00:00:24.370 --> 00:00:26.560
And I bring greetings
also from Paris,

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:30.100
where I'm serving this summer
as the theologian in residence

00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:32.259
at the American
Cathedral in Paris,

00:00:32.259 --> 00:00:35.410
and I am living in a bell
tower like Quasimodo.

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:40.120
It's 64 steps up, and
I blew my knee out

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:42.250
two years ago in this
apartment, and it is not

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:46.000
getting any better, but it
is a joy to be with you today

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.580
and to talk about this new book
from Oxford University Press,

00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:50.020
"Living With the Living Dead."

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:52.340
And I'm going to read you
a tiny little piece of it,

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:54.465
and then I'm going to talk
about some of the things

00:00:54.465 --> 00:00:56.950
that sort of impelled me
to write it, because one

00:00:56.950 --> 00:00:59.158
of the things that I want
to confess sort of straight

00:00:59.158 --> 00:01:01.120
off the bat is that
I don't sit around

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:03.640
at night watching zombie films.

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:08.047
That is not necessarily
my entertainment du jour.

00:01:08.047 --> 00:01:09.880
And one of the things
that I discovered is--

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:11.230
I talked with people
about this book

00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:13.563
over the last couple of years
that I was working on it--

00:01:13.563 --> 00:01:16.900
was that there were two really
sort of radically different

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:20.050
responses to the
fact that I was going

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:22.120
to make this my
25th or 26th book,

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:23.890
and it was going to
be about zombies.

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:25.473
And so there were
some people who were

00:01:25.473 --> 00:01:28.210
like, why would you do that?

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:31.030
What a waste of gray matter?

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:31.877
Find something else.

00:01:31.877 --> 00:01:32.710
Write another novel.

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:33.209
Do this.

00:01:33.209 --> 00:01:34.079
Do that.

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:35.620
And I noticed, by
the way, that there

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:37.510
tended to be sort of
a generational aspect

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:39.070
to this breakdown.

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:41.520
So a couple of weeks ago
in San Antonio, Texas, I

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:44.020
was giving a talk about the
book, and one of the questions

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:46.450
was basically, can
you tell me why

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:50.620
my grandchildren want to get
on the TV and kill zombies?

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:52.630
And when I could actually
explain that to them,

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:56.242
they were like, oh, that
kind of makes sense.

00:01:56.242 --> 00:01:57.700
So you've got your
one group, who's

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:00.640
like, I don't understand
this whole thing.

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:02.870
I get that it's a thing.

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:04.370
And then you've got
the other group,

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:05.500
and when I told
them I was working

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:07.870
on a book on the zombie
apocalypse, they were like, oh,

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:09.210
sweet.

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:11.320
Cannot wait.

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:14.440
And so really very
different responses,

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:17.260
but what it encouraged me to
think about is that I actually

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:21.130
needed to write a book that
helped both of those sets

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:25.000
of people understand why it is
that the zombie apocalypse is

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:30.670
such a powerful and pervasive
story in our kind of post-9/11

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:32.840
Western environment.

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:36.850
And so to start off with, I
think it's probably important

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:39.730
to recognize that, even if
you are not a connoisseur

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:42.760
of zombies, you
cannot avoid them.

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:45.400
This, of course, is last
week's "New Statesman,"

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:47.930
and, as much as I admire
the "New Statesman"

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:52.930
as a middle aged, white,
liberal leaning sort of person,

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:54.894
it's not hip.

00:02:54.894 --> 00:02:57.310
And one of the things that's
been really interesting, as I

00:02:57.310 --> 00:02:59.140
thought about the
sort of pervasiveness,

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:01.714
the reach of the story
of the zombie apocalypse,

00:03:01.714 --> 00:03:03.130
is that, even
though it starts out

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:05.560
in what we might think
of as geek culture

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:10.240
and with teenagers
and 20-somethings,

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:15.580
it has spread out from there
to an incredible extent.

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:17.020
In my research,
what I discovered

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:20.470
is that, in addition to
last week's "New Statesman,"

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:23.950
we often find images
from or references

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:26.890
to the zombie apocalypse
and "The Financial Times,"

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:29.650
in "The Economist,"
in the venerable

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:32.440
"New York Times,"
which a couple of years

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:35.050
ago recorded that, in the
entire history of "The New York

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:39.580
Times," they had used the words
zombie apocalypse four times,

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:42.980
but in the most recent year
they had used it 20 times,

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:47.590
including in a story on peanut
butter and banana sandwiches.

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:51.440
And so when we take that,
when we take the zombie films,

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:55.930
novels, comics, when we take the
fact that "The Walking Dead" is

00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:59.980
the most popular television show
in the world in the 19 to 49

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:03.671
demographic, when we take the
fact that "Game of Thrones"

00:04:03.671 --> 00:04:05.920
is one of the world's most
popular, most watched, most

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:07.690
stolen shows--

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:11.230
and if you forget for a
moment that "Game of Thrones"

00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:13.240
is actually about the
zombie apocalypse,

00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:17.140
at least one episode per
season reminds you of that--

00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:20.690
so it is out there over,
and over, and over again.

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:22.330
And so what I wanted
to do was I wanted

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:24.550
to write a book that would
help to sort of explain

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:27.640
why it is that we are
so drawn to this story

00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:31.270
and also what sorts of
things we learn from it,

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:34.480
because my work as a
critic and a theologian

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:36.970
is largely around
trying to figure out

00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:39.070
what is it that we take
away from the things

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:43.060
that we read, or watch,
or listen to, or play.

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:46.990
And we typically consume them
for enjoyment and `diversion`,

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:49.570
but what often happens is
that we discover that either

00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:52.670
consciously or subconsciously--
usually subconsciously--

00:04:52.670 --> 00:04:55.990
we're engaging with those
stories in some ways,

00:04:55.990 --> 00:04:58.270
watching the decisions
the characters make,

00:04:58.270 --> 00:05:01.670
and kind of learning
something in the process.

00:05:01.670 --> 00:05:03.670
So here's where
I'd like to begin.

00:05:03.670 --> 00:05:07.820
This is a piece from the
first chapter of the book,

00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:10.510
and I think it kind
of sets the stage

00:05:10.510 --> 00:05:13.240
for what it is that
I was hoping to do

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:15.592
and for the different kinds
of responses that I got.

00:05:15.592 --> 00:05:17.800
And then I want to go from
here and talk a little bit

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:22.190
about the zombie as a
metaphor in contemporary life

00:05:22.190 --> 00:05:25.540
and some of the different
kind of wisdom points

00:05:25.540 --> 00:05:29.880
that we can learn from
the zombie apocalypse.

00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:32.760
"My friend Sarah Bird,
an acclaimed novelist

00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:35.550
and screenwriter,
recently confessed to me

00:05:35.550 --> 00:05:38.650
over pints at a North Campus
pub in our hometown of Austin,

00:05:38.650 --> 00:05:42.520
Texas, Greg, I don't get it.

00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:43.720
I want to.

00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:47.050
I see zombies everywhere,
but the whole thing

00:05:47.050 --> 00:05:51.100
seems so bizarre to me.

00:05:51.100 --> 00:05:53.140
I understood her.

00:05:53.140 --> 00:05:55.540
Despite my passion for
this book and its topic,

00:05:55.540 --> 00:05:58.840
I would not describe
myself as a zombie fanatic.

00:05:58.840 --> 00:06:02.650
The living dead also seem at
first a strange entertainment

00:06:02.650 --> 00:06:04.800
choice to me."

00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:06.660
"Like many people
over the age of 18,

00:06:06.660 --> 00:06:10.170
I no longer take much
pleasure in being frightened

00:06:10.170 --> 00:06:13.410
or in consuming gore
for gore's sake.

00:06:13.410 --> 00:06:17.730
I sometimes feel, in fact,
more disturbed than enlightened

00:06:17.730 --> 00:06:20.550
by stories of the walking dead.

00:06:20.550 --> 00:06:23.490
But as a writer, cultural
critic, and theologian,

00:06:23.490 --> 00:06:26.040
it does seem to me that
something important is going on

00:06:26.040 --> 00:06:30.000
that I need to understand
and help others understand,

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:31.770
like my friend."

00:06:31.770 --> 00:06:37.410
I see zombies everywhere,
and I want to know why."

00:06:37.410 --> 00:06:40.116
On that afternoon in Austin,
I looked across the table

00:06:40.116 --> 00:06:41.490
at Sarah and summed
up what I had

00:06:41.490 --> 00:06:45.590
discovered in two years of
research on two continents.

00:06:45.590 --> 00:06:50.070
When humanity seems to be facing
an extinction level event,

00:06:50.070 --> 00:06:53.070
the dead get up
and walk around."

00:06:56.047 --> 00:06:57.880
That was one of the
most amazing discoveries

00:06:57.880 --> 00:07:00.149
that I made in the
course of the research

00:07:00.149 --> 00:07:01.190
and writing of this book.

00:07:03.870 --> 00:07:08.060
We can go back at least
as far as the Middle Ages.

00:07:08.060 --> 00:07:11.570
What we have here is La "Mort
Saint Innocent," the statue

00:07:11.570 --> 00:07:14.960
of death that used to stand in
the Cemetery of the Innocents

00:07:14.960 --> 00:07:19.400
in Paris, and where it was in
the Cemetery of the Innocents

00:07:19.400 --> 00:07:22.580
it was surrounded by one
of the best known frescoes

00:07:22.580 --> 00:07:29.480
of the rendering of death
coming for every member

00:07:29.480 --> 00:07:32.060
of the society,
the danse macabre,

00:07:32.060 --> 00:07:35.300
and a whole bunch of human
bones sort of stacked up

00:07:35.300 --> 00:07:37.010
to the rafters.

00:07:37.010 --> 00:07:39.740
It would have been a
really imposing thing.

00:07:39.740 --> 00:07:42.430
Now, the Cemetery of the
Innocents no longer exists.

00:07:42.430 --> 00:07:44.430
All the bones that were
there, you may be aware,

00:07:44.430 --> 00:07:48.080
are now sort of in the
catacombs underneath Paris,

00:07:48.080 --> 00:07:50.120
but imagine sort of
walking into that room

00:07:50.120 --> 00:07:53.240
and seeing this figure and
seeing all of these frescoes

00:07:53.240 --> 00:07:55.550
around the room of
embodied Death--

00:07:55.550 --> 00:07:57.380
Death with a capital D--

00:07:57.380 --> 00:08:00.770
reaching out with it's
sort of moldering paw

00:08:00.770 --> 00:08:03.710
and grabbing everybody
in society from the pope

00:08:03.710 --> 00:08:06.046
down to the lowliest peasant.

00:08:06.046 --> 00:08:07.920
One of the things that
was really interesting

00:08:07.920 --> 00:08:09.295
as I took a look
at these images,

00:08:09.295 --> 00:08:11.550
including La "Mort
Saint Innocent,"

00:08:11.550 --> 00:08:16.620
is that they look a little bit
like our zombies in "Walking

00:08:16.620 --> 00:08:19.920
Dead" or any of the other sort
of representations of them.

00:08:19.920 --> 00:08:23.730
And we find this in art from
the Middle Ages forward.

00:08:23.730 --> 00:08:25.230
We find it in art
from the trenches

00:08:25.230 --> 00:08:27.720
in World War I. We find it
in art from the Holocaust.

00:08:27.720 --> 00:08:30.890
We find it in art from
Hiroshima that there

00:08:30.890 --> 00:08:33.980
is this sort of
front and centering

00:08:33.980 --> 00:08:37.549
of death and human corpses
at times when people

00:08:37.549 --> 00:08:40.220
feel like threats are
moving toward them

00:08:40.220 --> 00:08:42.164
from every direction.

00:08:42.164 --> 00:08:44.330
And so one of the things
they helped me understand--

00:08:44.330 --> 00:08:48.320
the kind of defense mechanism
that writers, storytellers,

00:08:48.320 --> 00:08:51.500
artists have used over the
years is simply this idea

00:08:51.500 --> 00:08:53.880
that, when things
look really bad,

00:08:53.880 --> 00:08:58.480
this is something that seems
to happen in Western culture.

00:08:58.480 --> 00:09:01.990
And our zombies, as my
friend says, are bizarre.

00:09:01.990 --> 00:09:02.850
They're ridiculous.

00:09:02.850 --> 00:09:04.140
They're gory.

00:09:04.140 --> 00:09:06.550
At the conversation we had
at Blackstone's bookstore

00:09:06.550 --> 00:09:08.870
yesterday in Oxford,
somebody came to me and said,

00:09:08.870 --> 00:09:11.500
can you tell me the
scientific mechanism

00:09:11.500 --> 00:09:13.840
of how zombies are able to walk?

00:09:13.840 --> 00:09:18.640
I said, no, frankly, I
can't do that, but they do.

00:09:18.640 --> 00:09:21.860
And they keep walking,
and you have to run.

00:09:21.860 --> 00:09:23.440
So this is one of
the first things

00:09:23.440 --> 00:09:25.806
that I think is
really important.

00:09:25.806 --> 00:09:26.680
Yes, they're bizarre.

00:09:26.680 --> 00:09:27.430
Yes, they're gory.

00:09:27.430 --> 00:09:30.400
Yes, they're not for
everyone, but they're also

00:09:30.400 --> 00:09:34.360
a part of a pattern that we see
in Western culture going back

00:09:34.360 --> 00:09:38.145
at least 600 years that
helps us understand

00:09:38.145 --> 00:09:40.270
a little bit about what it
means to live in a world

00:09:40.270 --> 00:09:43.420
where we live with fear
and we live with threat.

00:09:43.420 --> 00:09:46.401
And if you read about
people in the 14th century,

00:09:46.401 --> 00:09:48.400
many of the popular
histories of the Middle Ages

00:09:48.400 --> 00:09:51.040
that I read in the course of
preparing to write this book--

00:09:51.040 --> 00:09:55.270
I was reading about
pandemics, and violence,

00:09:55.270 --> 00:09:59.980
and political unrest, and
financial unrest, and drought,

00:09:59.980 --> 00:10:03.530
and all of these terrible
things, climactic change,

00:10:03.530 --> 00:10:07.830
and I was just like, this is us.

00:10:07.830 --> 00:10:09.630
I mean, the only
difference probably

00:10:09.630 --> 00:10:11.838
is that we dress a little
better, bathe a little more

00:10:11.838 --> 00:10:13.360
often, but this is us.

00:10:13.360 --> 00:10:16.190
I mean, we are facing
the same set of problems.

00:10:16.190 --> 00:10:20.160
And so maybe it's not
so strange that death

00:10:20.160 --> 00:10:23.430
gets up and walks around.

00:10:23.430 --> 00:10:27.330
So in these stories where
death gets up and walks around,

00:10:27.330 --> 00:10:31.290
one of the things
that we ask is,

00:10:31.290 --> 00:10:35.170
how are these things like us
and how are they different?

00:10:35.170 --> 00:10:38.020
Most monsters are
somewhat human--

00:10:38.020 --> 00:10:40.370
the ones that are
most successful.

00:10:40.370 --> 00:10:42.810
If you look at sort of the
classic film monsters--

00:10:42.810 --> 00:10:46.570
the mummy, vampires, zombies--

00:10:46.570 --> 00:10:48.870
there is a human element.

00:10:48.870 --> 00:10:51.220
There is something sort
of recognizable to us,

00:10:51.220 --> 00:10:53.410
and yet there is something
different about them

00:10:53.410 --> 00:10:56.500
that sets them apart,
and that is what

00:10:56.500 --> 00:10:58.420
makes them monstrous to us.

00:10:58.420 --> 00:10:59.410
They look like us.

00:10:59.410 --> 00:11:03.790
They might even act like us,
and yet they are clearly not us.

00:11:03.790 --> 00:11:07.030
And so one of the things that
comes out of the zombie story

00:11:07.030 --> 00:11:09.310
is the way that
we can use zombies

00:11:09.310 --> 00:11:12.220
as a way of differentiating
ourselves and defining

00:11:12.220 --> 00:11:14.980
ourselves, because in many
of the stories of the zombie

00:11:14.980 --> 00:11:17.140
apocalypse, that's one
of the front and center

00:11:17.140 --> 00:11:19.360
sorts of themes,
going back all the way

00:11:19.360 --> 00:11:22.030
to the classic `renditions`
of George Romero, who

00:11:22.030 --> 00:11:25.660
was the originator
of the modern zombie.

00:11:25.660 --> 00:11:28.750
In one of his early films,
"The Dawn of the Dead,"

00:11:28.750 --> 00:11:32.980
the zombies wander into the
shopping mall and walk around.

00:11:32.980 --> 00:11:35.220
And frankly, there's not
a whole lot of difference.

00:11:35.220 --> 00:11:37.060
I mean, it's played for humor.

00:11:37.060 --> 00:11:39.940
And the elevator
music is-- the muzak

00:11:39.940 --> 00:11:41.710
is playing in the
hallways of the mall

00:11:41.710 --> 00:11:45.670
as the zombies `shamble`
from store to store,

00:11:45.670 --> 00:11:48.400
and the point that Romero
is kind of sort of making

00:11:48.400 --> 00:11:50.950
is that we live
in a culture where

00:11:50.950 --> 00:11:54.610
we at least partially define
ourselves by consumption.

00:11:54.610 --> 00:11:57.610
That's one of the
things that we do,

00:11:57.610 --> 00:12:00.700
but it's hopefully not
the only thing we do.

00:12:00.700 --> 00:12:03.670
What the zombie story allows us
also to do is to, as we said,

00:12:03.670 --> 00:12:04.810
differentiate ourselves.

00:12:04.810 --> 00:12:07.660
In what ways do we
differ from that?

00:12:07.660 --> 00:12:10.900
And for all the fact that
we might be sort of caught

00:12:10.900 --> 00:12:15.970
in a life where we don't
feel very conscious,

00:12:15.970 --> 00:12:20.620
and we do the same thing
sort of over and over again,

00:12:20.620 --> 00:12:23.770
and we consume, it's
also possible to think

00:12:23.770 --> 00:12:26.650
about what makes us different
from these monsters.

00:12:26.650 --> 00:12:29.380
And one of the great examples
from contemporary zombie

00:12:29.380 --> 00:12:33.460
literature is the British
film "Shaun of the Dead."

00:12:33.460 --> 00:12:36.250
The film title is,
as you've guessed,

00:12:36.250 --> 00:12:40.300
a takeoff on "Dawn of the Dead,"
and the main character, Shaun,

00:12:40.300 --> 00:12:42.760
is a person who is
sort of caught up

00:12:42.760 --> 00:12:46.330
in a life where he does the
same thing day, after day,

00:12:46.330 --> 00:12:47.860
after day, after day.

00:12:47.860 --> 00:12:49.810
And honestly there is
not that much difference

00:12:49.810 --> 00:12:52.450
between him and the zombies that
he's going to encounter later

00:12:52.450 --> 00:12:54.099
on in the movie.

00:12:54.099 --> 00:12:56.140
So "Shaun of the Dead" is
a sort of obvious play,

00:12:56.140 --> 00:12:58.210
not just on the
original Romero film,

00:12:58.210 --> 00:13:02.350
but kind of on the theme that
he is stuck in this thing that

00:13:02.350 --> 00:13:05.215
is not really life.

00:13:05.215 --> 00:13:07.090
And one of the things
out of the three things

00:13:07.090 --> 00:13:11.230
that he's written sort of
on his kitchen chalkboard--

00:13:11.230 --> 00:13:16.880
go round mum's is one, get
Liz back, sort life out.

00:13:16.880 --> 00:13:19.010
Sort life out.

00:13:19.010 --> 00:13:21.950
Because Liz tells him in the
first scene of the movie,

00:13:21.950 --> 00:13:24.140
I don't want to do this anymore.

00:13:24.140 --> 00:13:26.240
We do the same thing
over and over again,

00:13:26.240 --> 00:13:30.230
and it just feels
like I am dead.

00:13:30.230 --> 00:13:32.180
And so one of the
points, one of the themes

00:13:32.180 --> 00:13:33.555
that "Shaun of
the Dead" makes is

00:13:33.555 --> 00:13:36.710
that, in an unexamined
life, in a life where

00:13:36.710 --> 00:13:39.410
we do the same thing
over and over again,

00:13:39.410 --> 00:13:43.820
it can be really hard
to be fully alive.

00:13:43.820 --> 00:13:46.310
There is a wonderful
idea that comes

00:13:46.310 --> 00:13:49.010
from the Christian
thinker Irenaeus, who

00:13:49.010 --> 00:13:55.060
says that the joy of God is
the human being fully alive.

00:13:55.060 --> 00:13:57.790
And something very similar
from another wisdom tradition,

00:13:57.790 --> 00:14:00.730
the Gautama Buddha talks about,
if something is worth doing,

00:14:00.730 --> 00:14:04.300
do it with all your heart.

00:14:04.300 --> 00:14:06.130
And yet, we know
from our own lives

00:14:06.130 --> 00:14:11.270
that we don't always live
at that 100% human capacity.

00:14:11.270 --> 00:14:15.916
I probably have not
achieved it yet today,

00:14:15.916 --> 00:14:18.290
but one of the things that
the zombie story gets us to do

00:14:18.290 --> 00:14:22.040
is to ask, if we could
live into what we're

00:14:22.040 --> 00:14:26.030
capable of as human beings,
if we could be fully alive,

00:14:26.030 --> 00:14:28.670
what would that look like?

00:14:28.670 --> 00:14:31.820
On the back cover of Robert
Kirkman's first edition

00:14:31.820 --> 00:14:35.569
of the graphic novel
of "The Walking Dead,"

00:14:35.569 --> 00:14:37.610
there is this wonderful
sentence that I come back

00:14:37.610 --> 00:14:39.901
to over and over again when
I'm looking for inspiration

00:14:39.901 --> 00:14:42.050
from the zombie apocalypse.

00:14:42.050 --> 00:14:44.780
And what Kirkman asked
in that back cover copy--

00:14:44.780 --> 00:14:49.040
what he says is, "in a
world where the dead walk,

00:14:49.040 --> 00:14:54.310
we have to learn
to finally live."

00:14:54.310 --> 00:14:56.860
And that's the crazy,
interesting paradox,

00:14:56.860 --> 00:14:58.690
because in these
stories where it

00:14:58.690 --> 00:15:01.240
looks like the end
of the world, it also

00:15:01.240 --> 00:15:03.970
becomes a way for many of the
characters in these stories

00:15:03.970 --> 00:15:08.389
to become sort of what
they're called to be.

00:15:08.389 --> 00:15:10.180
And so in the story of
"Shaun of the Dead,"

00:15:10.180 --> 00:15:11.937
that's one of the big
things that happens.

00:15:11.937 --> 00:15:14.020
During the course of the
story, he becomes a hero.

00:15:14.020 --> 00:15:15.936
He becomes somebody
willing to kind of live up

00:15:15.936 --> 00:15:19.240
to his fullest extent, willing
to be in a relationship,

00:15:19.240 --> 00:15:20.771
willing to really love--

00:15:20.771 --> 00:15:23.020
I mean, all of the things
that sort of mark out people

00:15:23.020 --> 00:15:26.000
as being fully human.

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:27.530
And by the end of
the story, he's

00:15:27.530 --> 00:15:31.224
worked his way through
his kitchen list.

00:15:31.224 --> 00:15:32.640
And that is one
of the things that

00:15:32.640 --> 00:15:35.310
happens in a lot of these
zombie apocalypse stories.

00:15:35.310 --> 00:15:38.700
For those of you that watch
"The Walking Dead," whatever

00:15:38.700 --> 00:15:41.160
you think about the current
incarnation of Rick Grimes,

00:15:41.160 --> 00:15:43.110
it is a long way from
where we found him

00:15:43.110 --> 00:15:45.400
at the beginning of the story.

00:15:45.400 --> 00:15:49.870
I mean, he's a small town
deputy who becomes this leader,

00:15:49.870 --> 00:15:52.540
and we may not agree with
all the ethical decisions he

00:15:52.540 --> 00:15:55.300
makes-- that's something to
talk about in just a moment--

00:15:55.300 --> 00:15:59.050
but think about what he has
become because of the zombie

00:15:59.050 --> 00:16:01.400
apocalypse.

00:16:01.400 --> 00:16:03.860
I mean, it is an
amazing kind of arc

00:16:03.860 --> 00:16:05.769
for many of these characters.

00:16:05.769 --> 00:16:07.310
Another sort of
similar example would

00:16:07.310 --> 00:16:10.460
be the character of Jon
Snow in "Game of Thrones."

00:16:10.460 --> 00:16:12.080
Jon Snow is one of
the few characters

00:16:12.080 --> 00:16:15.650
to really take seriously the
menace of the White Walkers

00:16:15.650 --> 00:16:17.960
and that winter is
actually coming.

00:16:17.960 --> 00:16:21.770
And he goes from being
sort of the bastard child

00:16:21.770 --> 00:16:25.100
of a noble family
to a leader of men

00:16:25.100 --> 00:16:31.680
to a leader of a crusade,
really, of life against death.

00:16:31.680 --> 00:16:34.050
And so one of the
paradoxes that happens

00:16:34.050 --> 00:16:36.016
in these stories of
the zombie apocalypse--

00:16:36.016 --> 00:16:37.890
and it also happens in
other kinds of genres.

00:16:37.890 --> 00:16:39.000
it happens in war stories.

00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:41.670
It happens in other kinds
of apocalyptic genres--

00:16:41.670 --> 00:16:43.050
the end of the world--

00:16:43.050 --> 00:16:47.640
is that we get human behavior,
human conflict, human emotion

00:16:47.640 --> 00:16:52.470
kind of ratcheted up, because
at the end of the world,

00:16:52.470 --> 00:16:55.330
everything matters.

00:16:55.330 --> 00:16:57.840
I write these lovely sort
of quiet literary novels

00:16:57.840 --> 00:17:01.770
where about 250 pages
in something happens,

00:17:01.770 --> 00:17:04.440
and you can't have that
at the end of the world.

00:17:04.440 --> 00:17:07.629
Things start happening on
the first page, really.

00:17:07.629 --> 00:17:09.420
So that's one of the
really lovely things--

00:17:09.420 --> 00:17:11.609
is that the zombie story
and the use of the zombie

00:17:11.609 --> 00:17:15.000
gets us to thinking about what
it is that it means to be human

00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:21.006
and how we differ from these
sort of stick figure monsters.

00:17:21.006 --> 00:17:23.339
The other thing that the
zombies do for us in the zombie

00:17:23.339 --> 00:17:24.990
apocalypse story is--

00:17:24.990 --> 00:17:26.819
and we probably
can figure this out

00:17:26.819 --> 00:17:30.570
because we see this cropping
up at all of these flashpoints

00:17:30.570 --> 00:17:32.790
in human history.

00:17:32.790 --> 00:17:36.560
They help us to come to
grips with our own mortality,

00:17:36.560 --> 00:17:38.060
and they help us
in some way to come

00:17:38.060 --> 00:17:41.180
to grips with the idea of
this sort of relentless set

00:17:41.180 --> 00:17:43.746
of threats rolling toward us.

00:17:43.746 --> 00:17:45.620
And the zombie is
particularly good for this,

00:17:45.620 --> 00:17:49.960
because at least one on one,
you have a pretty good chance.

00:17:49.960 --> 00:17:51.290
Have you noticed that?

00:17:51.290 --> 00:17:54.440
If you have a baseball
bat, crowbar--

00:17:54.440 --> 00:17:57.200
there are things lying around
your house that could turn you

00:17:57.200 --> 00:17:59.090
into a zombie fighter.

00:17:59.090 --> 00:18:01.160
And yes, it would be awful.

00:18:01.160 --> 00:18:03.710
And yes, you would have
to clear out enough space

00:18:03.710 --> 00:18:07.380
to sleep, and get up, and
do the same thing tomorrow,

00:18:07.380 --> 00:18:09.770
but as the novelist and
essayist Chuck Klosterman said,

00:18:09.770 --> 00:18:13.130
that actually is what modern
life feels like to me.

00:18:13.130 --> 00:18:16.880
Waking up to discover
that I have 400 emails

00:18:16.880 --> 00:18:20.199
feels like killing
zombies, because I'm

00:18:20.199 --> 00:18:21.240
going to clear those out.

00:18:21.240 --> 00:18:21.860
I'm going to file them.

00:18:21.860 --> 00:18:23.540
I'm going to respond
to them, and God

00:18:23.540 --> 00:18:27.772
knows tomorrow I'm going
to do the same thing again.

00:18:27.772 --> 00:18:30.230
And so one of the things that
the zombie apocalypse sort of

00:18:30.230 --> 00:18:32.840
gets us to do is to think
about our own lives in a way

00:18:32.840 --> 00:18:35.150
that we can go,
yeah, I can do this.

00:18:35.150 --> 00:18:35.900
I can settle this.

00:18:35.900 --> 00:18:38.320
I can manage this.

00:18:38.320 --> 00:18:41.780
And honestly, 400
emails, or having

00:18:41.780 --> 00:18:45.410
to unload the dishwasher,
or dropping, the kids

00:18:45.410 --> 00:18:47.930
off, or any of those repetitive
tasks that we do over,

00:18:47.930 --> 00:18:50.388
and over, and over again that
seem like they are beating us

00:18:50.388 --> 00:18:54.665
to death are not nearly as
serious as the zombie horde.

00:18:54.665 --> 00:18:56.540
And so one of the things
that many people who

00:18:56.540 --> 00:19:00.470
write about zombies say is, this
is a wonderful monster for us

00:19:00.470 --> 00:19:02.480
because, at the end
of the day, even

00:19:02.480 --> 00:19:04.646
though that it lets us think
about our own problems,

00:19:04.646 --> 00:19:06.980
our own problems don't
measure up to this.

00:19:06.980 --> 00:19:08.900
It may feel like the
end of the world,

00:19:08.900 --> 00:19:12.430
but frankly, it probably
isn't, and that's

00:19:12.430 --> 00:19:14.960
kind of a good thing.

00:19:14.960 --> 00:19:18.767
So let's think about some of
the wisdom ideas that grow out

00:19:18.767 --> 00:19:21.100
of this, because one of the
things that was particularly

00:19:21.100 --> 00:19:22.933
interesting for me in
the writing of "Living

00:19:22.933 --> 00:19:25.480
with the Living Dead,"
was to think about some

00:19:25.480 --> 00:19:31.420
of the particular lessons that
these narratives excel in.

00:19:31.420 --> 00:19:33.680
And so I want to talk a
little bit about community,

00:19:33.680 --> 00:19:36.010
and I want to talk a
little bit about post-9/11,

00:19:36.010 --> 00:19:40.870
post-7/7 ethics, because one
of the things that happens

00:19:40.870 --> 00:19:43.480
in connection with the zombie
apocalypse is that most

00:19:43.480 --> 00:19:45.580
cultural critics
say that it is--

00:19:45.580 --> 00:19:48.370
the popularity of this
story or this trope

00:19:48.370 --> 00:19:50.920
is, in some ways,
a direct response

00:19:50.920 --> 00:19:54.830
to the number of threats that
we perceive at this moment.

00:19:54.830 --> 00:19:57.490
And the sort of
formative thing that we

00:19:57.490 --> 00:20:01.570
can do when we think about
this is we can think about 9/11

00:20:01.570 --> 00:20:03.910
in September of 2001.

00:20:03.910 --> 00:20:06.610
"28 Days Later" came
out a couple of weeks

00:20:06.610 --> 00:20:09.460
after the towers
fell in New York,

00:20:09.460 --> 00:20:13.060
and the zombie
apocalypse has just

00:20:13.060 --> 00:20:17.740
grown in size since that time.

00:20:17.740 --> 00:20:21.730
Between a third and a half of
all zombie movies ever made

00:20:21.730 --> 00:20:25.960
have come out since
9/11, and so when

00:20:25.960 --> 00:20:28.450
we say that there is probably
some sort of connection

00:20:28.450 --> 00:20:31.600
with that, obviously, it's
not scientific, except to say,

00:20:31.600 --> 00:20:32.650
look at this.

00:20:32.650 --> 00:20:35.050
This is one of the biggest
stories in the world,

00:20:35.050 --> 00:20:38.500
and there's got to be a reason
that people are so drawn to it.

00:20:38.500 --> 00:20:40.500
So let's think about a
couple of the things that

00:20:40.500 --> 00:20:43.720
might help account for what
people are getting out of this,

00:20:43.720 --> 00:20:45.369
and I want to start
with community,

00:20:45.369 --> 00:20:47.910
because one of the things that
the zombie apocalypse is about

00:20:47.910 --> 00:20:51.392
is, I think, in some ways,
our current situation.

00:20:51.392 --> 00:20:53.100
How do we live in a
world where there are

00:20:53.100 --> 00:20:55.790
things that we're afraid of?

00:20:55.790 --> 00:20:58.030
Where there are people
that we're afraid of?

00:20:58.030 --> 00:21:02.690
Where we wonder and worry about
what life is going to be like?

00:21:02.690 --> 00:21:06.740
And what do we do in
response to the people

00:21:06.740 --> 00:21:10.160
that we encounter either
locally or outside sort

00:21:10.160 --> 00:21:12.560
of our sphere of influence?

00:21:12.560 --> 00:21:17.600
In the zombie narratives, there
are two major ways that people

00:21:17.600 --> 00:21:19.490
respond to other human beings.

00:21:19.490 --> 00:21:22.400
One is to close
themselves off from them--

00:21:22.400 --> 00:21:25.680
to, in a sort of contemporary
parlance, build walls.

00:21:25.680 --> 00:21:29.010
I will be safe behind
my beautiful wall,

00:21:29.010 --> 00:21:31.169
and that is one of the
approaches that people take,

00:21:31.169 --> 00:21:33.460
and as we'll see when we talk
about ethics in a second,

00:21:33.460 --> 00:21:36.720
it's a natural response to fear.

00:21:36.720 --> 00:21:38.940
I will build this wall,
and behind this wall,

00:21:38.940 --> 00:21:41.370
I will be safe.

00:21:41.370 --> 00:21:43.290
And sort of a corollary
that we could say--

00:21:43.290 --> 00:21:46.830
I'm going to respond with
suspicion and possibly

00:21:46.830 --> 00:21:49.620
with violence to
anyone that I believe

00:21:49.620 --> 00:21:51.740
is going to be a threat.

00:21:51.740 --> 00:21:54.800
So that is one way that
we can approach this.

00:21:54.800 --> 00:21:56.510
And then the other
way is to think about,

00:21:56.510 --> 00:21:59.120
could this person be an ally?

00:21:59.120 --> 00:22:03.410
Could I respond to this
person with compassion?

00:22:03.410 --> 00:22:04.820
Would my life be improved?

00:22:04.820 --> 00:22:09.270
Would my chances of survival
be improved by friendship,

00:22:09.270 --> 00:22:15.710
by compassion, by extending
some sort of relationship?

00:22:15.710 --> 00:22:17.590
And both of those
things are explored

00:22:17.590 --> 00:22:20.280
in the zombie apocalypse story.

00:22:20.280 --> 00:22:23.980
Now, as a person who
sort of leans toward hope

00:22:23.980 --> 00:22:28.380
as opposed to despair, I
like the second one better,

00:22:28.380 --> 00:22:31.050
but I also understand
that first impulse.

00:22:31.050 --> 00:22:34.020
And as somebody who is
American and who watched

00:22:34.020 --> 00:22:37.830
America's response as we
formulated what we think

00:22:37.830 --> 00:22:41.732
of as the war on terror, I
know that that is a response--

00:22:41.732 --> 00:22:44.190
that first response is one that
a lot of people thought was

00:22:44.190 --> 00:22:47.670
a powerful and appropriate
one, but as we think about

00:22:47.670 --> 00:22:51.090
community-- and excuse me for
a second as I mainline some

00:22:51.090 --> 00:22:51.871
caffeine--

00:22:55.930 --> 00:22:58.600
one of the great zombie
apocalypse stories taking

00:22:58.600 --> 00:23:02.140
a look at a community in
the contemporary world

00:23:02.140 --> 00:23:04.810
is "Zombieland," and I
don't know if any of you

00:23:04.810 --> 00:23:06.580
have seen it.

00:23:06.580 --> 00:23:07.599
Yes, one?

00:23:07.599 --> 00:23:08.140
Anybody else?

00:23:10.780 --> 00:23:13.120
Whether or not you like
zombies, you might enjoy it.

00:23:13.120 --> 00:23:14.530
Woody Harrelson is in it--

00:23:14.530 --> 00:23:16.876
Jesse Eisenberg, Emma Stone.

00:23:16.876 --> 00:23:18.250
I mean, it's got
an amazing cast.

00:23:18.250 --> 00:23:18.760
It's smart.

00:23:18.760 --> 00:23:19.540
It's funny.

00:23:19.540 --> 00:23:21.220
It's a little gory
at the beginning,

00:23:21.220 --> 00:23:22.800
and I will just
warn you about that.

00:23:22.800 --> 00:23:26.620
You may want to fast forward,
but if you get to the story

00:23:26.620 --> 00:23:30.010
itself, what it really
is is a character story.

00:23:30.010 --> 00:23:31.930
And this-- by the way,
sort of sidebar this--

00:23:31.930 --> 00:23:33.430
one of the really
interesting things

00:23:33.430 --> 00:23:35.263
about these stories of
the zombie apocalypse

00:23:35.263 --> 00:23:37.980
is that they're not
actually about zombies.

00:23:37.980 --> 00:23:41.160
I had the chance to interview
Angela Kang, the writer

00:23:41.160 --> 00:23:43.590
and executive producer
of "The Walking Dead,"

00:23:43.590 --> 00:23:46.090
and she said, you know, people
think that "The Walking Dead"

00:23:46.090 --> 00:23:46.890
is a zombie show.

00:23:46.890 --> 00:23:48.510
It's not about zombies.

00:23:48.510 --> 00:23:52.500
It's about the human
beings and their response

00:23:52.500 --> 00:23:54.690
to a world that's gone crazy.

00:23:54.690 --> 00:23:57.270
How do people survive
in a world like that?

00:23:57.270 --> 00:23:59.322
That's where the
stories come from,

00:23:59.322 --> 00:24:00.780
and in fact, she
was very explicit.

00:24:00.780 --> 00:24:03.030
She said, you know, the
monsters on "The Walking Dead"

00:24:03.030 --> 00:24:04.170
are not the zombies.

00:24:04.170 --> 00:24:07.610
They're human beings, because
that's the interesting part

00:24:07.610 --> 00:24:09.620
to explore.

00:24:09.620 --> 00:24:12.650
And so what these stories
do is, in the context

00:24:12.650 --> 00:24:14.240
of the survival of
their characters,

00:24:14.240 --> 00:24:15.823
they let us explore
some of these sort

00:24:15.823 --> 00:24:20.120
of universal existential
issues like community.

00:24:20.120 --> 00:24:21.530
Where do I stand?

00:24:21.530 --> 00:24:24.800
How should I fit
into a world where

00:24:24.800 --> 00:24:27.410
there are these sort of
widely different ways

00:24:27.410 --> 00:24:29.690
that I can relate
to other people?

00:24:29.690 --> 00:24:32.427
So at the opening of
"Zombieland," the character

00:24:32.427 --> 00:24:35.010
who's played by Jesse Eisenberg,
who is a student, by the way,

00:24:35.010 --> 00:24:36.800
at the University
of Texas in Austin--

00:24:36.800 --> 00:24:39.800
there's this nice, little, kind
of local connection to it--

00:24:39.800 --> 00:24:43.760
is trying to escape from
Texas, and he is somewhere out

00:24:43.760 --> 00:24:45.010
in rural East Texas.

00:24:45.010 --> 00:24:47.300
And my god, Texas
just goes on for days.

00:24:47.300 --> 00:24:50.120
You probably know that
Texas is the size of France,

00:24:50.120 --> 00:24:53.870
and you could drive
across Texas and still--

00:24:53.870 --> 00:24:55.850
I mean, it would take a day.

00:24:55.850 --> 00:24:57.770
It would take a day and a half.

00:24:57.770 --> 00:25:01.370
And so he is apparently trying
to get out of Texas and back

00:25:01.370 --> 00:25:03.260
to where he thinks
his family might be,

00:25:03.260 --> 00:25:05.806
although it's clear that
he's not very close to them.

00:25:05.806 --> 00:25:07.430
And we start off the
movie, and there's

00:25:07.430 --> 00:25:09.740
this voiceover from
Columbus, and he

00:25:09.740 --> 00:25:12.560
is in a parking lot
in a gas station.

00:25:12.560 --> 00:25:15.772
And he says, that's
me down there.

00:25:15.772 --> 00:25:17.480
And he says, you might
find it surprising

00:25:17.480 --> 00:25:20.300
that I've survived this
long, you know, what

00:25:20.300 --> 00:25:23.750
with my different kind of
quirks and my irritable bowel

00:25:23.750 --> 00:25:27.500
syndrome, but I think
the reason that I've

00:25:27.500 --> 00:25:33.310
made it this far is that I never
really had much use for people.

00:25:33.310 --> 00:25:34.870
Even before people
were zombies, I

00:25:34.870 --> 00:25:37.120
treated them like
they were zombies.

00:25:37.120 --> 00:25:39.370
And that's an important
thing, because we'll come back

00:25:39.370 --> 00:25:41.110
to that in just a second.

00:25:41.110 --> 00:25:43.570
Basically, what he is saying
is he has lived this long

00:25:43.570 --> 00:25:46.630
because he doesn't have to
rely on anybody but himself,

00:25:46.630 --> 00:25:48.019
and he's created a set of rules.

00:25:48.019 --> 00:25:49.810
If you want to check
out the internet meme,

00:25:49.810 --> 00:25:52.540
it would be Zombieland rules.

00:25:52.540 --> 00:25:56.680
And they are rules like
cardio, which is immediately

00:25:56.680 --> 00:25:59.260
illustrated for us when he is
chased by first one, then two,

00:25:59.260 --> 00:26:01.990
and then three zombies
around the parking lot

00:26:01.990 --> 00:26:04.585
as he's trying to fuel his car.

00:26:04.585 --> 00:26:07.210
Another of the rules that would
be pretty important if you were

00:26:07.210 --> 00:26:09.760
trying to live alone in the
world of the zombie apocalypse

00:26:09.760 --> 00:26:12.920
is watch out for bathrooms.

00:26:12.920 --> 00:26:14.510
I mean, that is the
last place where

00:26:14.510 --> 00:26:17.720
you want to be approached
by a zombie, right?

00:26:17.720 --> 00:26:19.370
And then the third
one, which becomes

00:26:19.370 --> 00:26:21.020
important at the
end of the story--

00:26:21.020 --> 00:26:23.180
and it makes sense if
you're thinking about things

00:26:23.180 --> 00:26:26.902
from that initial idea of how we
relate to other human beings--

00:26:26.902 --> 00:26:28.610
but the third rule
that I want to mention

00:26:28.610 --> 00:26:32.360
to you that's explored at
the outset of "Zombieland" is

00:26:32.360 --> 00:26:34.810
don't be a hero.

00:26:37.840 --> 00:26:39.520
Don't be a hero.

00:26:43.330 --> 00:26:45.170
And we know this from
other narratives.

00:26:45.170 --> 00:26:46.586
One of my favorite
American films,

00:26:46.586 --> 00:26:49.390
"Casablanca," the Humphrey
Bogart character, Rick,

00:26:49.390 --> 00:26:52.870
says I stick my
neck out for nobody.

00:26:52.870 --> 00:26:57.090
And that is a way of making
your way in this world, right?

00:26:57.090 --> 00:26:58.980
And it's gotten him this far.

00:26:58.980 --> 00:27:01.330
He's at least
halfway out of Texas,

00:27:01.330 --> 00:27:02.850
and that's halfway
across France.

00:27:05.620 --> 00:27:08.300
Don't be a hero.

00:27:08.300 --> 00:27:10.950
And so when he meets some
other survivors along the way,

00:27:10.950 --> 00:27:12.780
his initial response
to them is not

00:27:12.780 --> 00:27:16.140
that compassionate, welcoming,
hospitality sort of.

00:27:16.140 --> 00:27:20.250
Response it's the sort of
hermeneutic of suspicion.

00:27:20.250 --> 00:27:23.684
I'm going to read everything
you do with the idea

00:27:23.684 --> 00:27:25.350
that you may want to
hurt me or that you

00:27:25.350 --> 00:27:27.902
may want to take what
I have, and that's

00:27:27.902 --> 00:27:30.360
a very typical thing that we
find in the zombie apocalypse,

00:27:30.360 --> 00:27:33.094
as we'll see in a second.

00:27:33.094 --> 00:27:35.010
And so he meets the Woody
Harrelson character,

00:27:35.010 --> 00:27:37.426
and sort of against their best
judgment they kind of drive

00:27:37.426 --> 00:27:38.560
on together.

00:27:38.560 --> 00:27:41.190
And then they meet these
two sisters, who immediately

00:27:41.190 --> 00:27:45.180
reward their trust by stealing
their car, and, in fact,

00:27:45.180 --> 00:27:47.744
steal their car more than
once in this movie, which

00:27:47.744 --> 00:27:50.160
is kind of an interesting
thing, and it sort of reminds us

00:27:50.160 --> 00:27:53.384
that there are guidelines and
a lot of wisdom traditions

00:27:53.384 --> 00:27:55.800
about how we live together,
because human beings, as I was

00:27:55.800 --> 00:27:58.320
telling my son the other
day, disappoint each other

00:27:58.320 --> 00:28:00.880
on a pretty regular basis.

00:28:00.880 --> 00:28:03.120
And so you have to
forgive each other

00:28:03.120 --> 00:28:07.020
if you're going to go on being
in relationship with them,

00:28:07.020 --> 00:28:10.440
but the really important
point of "Zombieland"

00:28:10.440 --> 00:28:12.810
is that we get to the
third act of the movie,

00:28:12.810 --> 00:28:15.870
and Columbus decides
that he is going

00:28:15.870 --> 00:28:18.300
to set aside some
of his usual rules

00:28:18.300 --> 00:28:20.280
because he's started to
develop relationships

00:28:20.280 --> 00:28:20.880
with these people.

00:28:20.880 --> 00:28:22.213
He's started to care about them.

00:28:22.213 --> 00:28:24.840
He realized that
they care about him

00:28:24.840 --> 00:28:27.030
and that life is actually
better-- not just

00:28:27.030 --> 00:28:30.600
pragmatically better in that
you've got another set of eyes

00:28:30.600 --> 00:28:33.960
to watch for zombies,
but better in the sense

00:28:33.960 --> 00:28:36.300
that we were talking about
earlier and the idea of being

00:28:36.300 --> 00:28:39.280
fully realized human beings.

00:28:39.280 --> 00:28:45.370
We are better with each other
than we are by ourselves.

00:28:45.370 --> 00:28:47.770
Desmond Tutu talks
about this concept.

00:28:47.770 --> 00:28:51.040
He calls Ubuntu, which is a
southern African concept that

00:28:51.040 --> 00:28:53.020
is really sort of
alien to Americans

00:28:53.020 --> 00:28:55.960
who have this idea of
individuality and pulling

00:28:55.960 --> 00:28:58.360
yourself up by
your own bootstrap,

00:28:58.360 --> 00:29:00.700
but the idea behind
Ubuntu is that we

00:29:00.700 --> 00:29:02.860
are formed by each other.

00:29:02.860 --> 00:29:07.480
Literally it's translated
I am because we are,

00:29:07.480 --> 00:29:09.770
and it's an idea about
how important community

00:29:09.770 --> 00:29:13.040
can be in making us the people
that we're called to be,

00:29:13.040 --> 00:29:16.490
in supporting us, and
challenging us, and pushing us.

00:29:16.490 --> 00:29:20.870
And what we find in
"Zombieland" is this idea

00:29:20.870 --> 00:29:25.380
that Columbus has actually
become a better person--

00:29:25.380 --> 00:29:29.060
not just a safer person,
but a better person

00:29:29.060 --> 00:29:32.490
because he's been involved
with these people.

00:29:32.490 --> 00:29:34.280
And so he sees these
sisters in danger

00:29:34.280 --> 00:29:36.690
toward the end of
the movie, and he

00:29:36.690 --> 00:29:40.020
changes the "Zombieland" rules.

00:29:40.020 --> 00:29:44.860
Don't be a hero gets
thrown out the window.

00:29:44.860 --> 00:29:50.584
The new rule, he
says, is be a hero.

00:29:50.584 --> 00:29:52.000
And at the end of
the movie, there

00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:53.570
is this wonderful
kind of voiceover

00:29:53.570 --> 00:29:56.090
that parallels the one
at the beginning-- the

00:29:56.090 --> 00:29:58.550
that's me down there by myself.

00:29:58.550 --> 00:30:01.940
He's like, look at that guy
in that truck over there.

00:30:01.940 --> 00:30:04.240
Look at those girls.

00:30:04.240 --> 00:30:09.527
They're the closest thing
I've ever had to family.

00:30:09.527 --> 00:30:11.610
And the last words of the
movie are really lovely,

00:30:11.610 --> 00:30:13.740
because they tie us back
into the whole idea of how

00:30:13.740 --> 00:30:16.102
the zombie apocalypse
can teach us.

00:30:16.102 --> 00:30:18.060
What Columbus says at
the very end of the movie

00:30:18.060 --> 00:30:23.200
and we fade out is, if you
don't have other people,

00:30:23.200 --> 00:30:24.450
you might as well be a zombie.

00:30:27.490 --> 00:30:29.410
And we see this in
other places, as well.

00:30:29.410 --> 00:30:31.750
We can see it in
"Game of Thrones."

00:30:31.750 --> 00:30:33.250
we can see it in
"The Walking Dead."

00:30:33.250 --> 00:30:34.458
We can see it in other films.

00:30:34.458 --> 00:30:36.400
We can see it novels
and graphic novels.

00:30:36.400 --> 00:30:38.470
We can even see it
in such simple things

00:30:38.470 --> 00:30:42.079
as the zombie modules in
first person shooters, where

00:30:42.079 --> 00:30:44.620
you're part of a team and you
can decide whether to resurrect

00:30:44.620 --> 00:30:47.510
somebody or not.

00:30:47.510 --> 00:30:50.330
I've had endless discussions
with my 19 year old son about

00:30:50.330 --> 00:30:52.780
whether that's a good
game tactic or not.

00:30:52.780 --> 00:30:55.280
And I'm like, who cares if
it's a good game tactic?

00:30:55.280 --> 00:30:56.840
Be a good person.

00:30:56.840 --> 00:30:58.310
Go get them up.

00:30:58.310 --> 00:31:00.840
But dad, that
doesn't make sense.

00:31:00.840 --> 00:31:03.232
I don't care.

00:31:03.232 --> 00:31:04.940
We were arguing when
I put him on the bus

00:31:04.940 --> 00:31:07.532
to Brussels a while ago.

00:31:07.532 --> 00:31:09.990
So that's the first thing that
I think is really important.

00:31:09.990 --> 00:31:13.700
The zombie apocalypse allows us
to explore this question of how

00:31:13.700 --> 00:31:15.980
we think about
community in a world

00:31:15.980 --> 00:31:17.600
where we wrestle
with fear and menace

00:31:17.600 --> 00:31:20.150
coming at us from lots
of different directions.

00:31:20.150 --> 00:31:24.680
And again, as we said, those
two responses are there.

00:31:24.680 --> 00:31:27.740
We can see the second
response in some places,

00:31:27.740 --> 00:31:30.590
and it's an exciting and
really energizing response,

00:31:30.590 --> 00:31:33.080
because it's, as we said, this
way that we can think about

00:31:33.080 --> 00:31:37.100
being fully human, but the first
response makes sense to us,

00:31:37.100 --> 00:31:39.950
too, because it's a response
that we've seen lived out

00:31:39.950 --> 00:31:42.450
in our own post-9/11 reality.

00:31:42.450 --> 00:31:45.069
And so in the last couple of
minutes of my time talking

00:31:45.069 --> 00:31:46.610
with you, I want to
talk a little bit

00:31:46.610 --> 00:31:48.850
about some of the ethics
of the zombie apocalypse

00:31:48.850 --> 00:31:50.600
and some of the ways
that it sort of makes

00:31:50.600 --> 00:31:55.100
us reflect on the world that we
live in now and our responses

00:31:55.100 --> 00:31:57.350
to threat and menace.

00:31:57.350 --> 00:32:00.650
One of the most important
tales of the zombie apocalypse

00:32:00.650 --> 00:32:03.470
is not actually a story
with zombies in it.

00:32:03.470 --> 00:32:07.070
There is a novel by the great
American author Cormac McCarthy

00:32:07.070 --> 00:32:09.770
called "The Road,"
and there was a film

00:32:09.770 --> 00:32:11.570
that was made of this, as well.

00:32:11.570 --> 00:32:15.890
And I was taken to task by a
zombie journal for including it

00:32:15.890 --> 00:32:18.200
in my book because they
were angry because there are

00:32:18.200 --> 00:32:21.454
no actual zombies, but if
you have not read the book,

00:32:21.454 --> 00:32:23.120
then I will just sort
of explain to you.

00:32:23.120 --> 00:32:26.220
It's a post apocalyptic
future in which there

00:32:26.220 --> 00:32:30.230
are a few human survivors, and
many of the remaining survivors

00:32:30.230 --> 00:32:33.530
are eating the other
survivors, so it kind of

00:32:33.530 --> 00:32:35.960
feels zombie-ish to me.

00:32:35.960 --> 00:32:39.214
And it's the same kinds of
ethical questions and dilemmas

00:32:39.214 --> 00:32:40.880
that get explored in
this book in a very

00:32:40.880 --> 00:32:43.280
literary and beautiful way.

00:32:43.280 --> 00:32:46.160
The two main characters the
book are a father and a son.

00:32:46.160 --> 00:32:48.110
The man and the boy is
how they're described.

00:32:48.110 --> 00:32:50.960
Their names are
never given, and they

00:32:50.960 --> 00:32:53.690
are trying to get to
the sea for reasons

00:32:53.690 --> 00:32:54.970
that we don't really know.

00:32:54.970 --> 00:32:56.120
There's no food.

00:32:56.120 --> 00:32:57.860
All the vegetation is dead.

00:32:57.860 --> 00:33:00.860
This is a horrible, horrible
world that they're living in.

00:33:00.860 --> 00:33:03.860
And when they encounter
people along the way,

00:33:03.860 --> 00:33:08.330
the father treats each of those
people as a potential threat,

00:33:08.330 --> 00:33:09.950
and so that's that
first reaction

00:33:09.950 --> 00:33:13.040
that we were talking about
to the sort of reaction

00:33:13.040 --> 00:33:17.420
of suspicion and fear.

00:33:17.420 --> 00:33:20.990
And it's certainly
justified, because there

00:33:20.990 --> 00:33:23.390
is a horrific
scene in "The Road"

00:33:23.390 --> 00:33:27.260
where the father and son go down
into a cellar looking for food

00:33:27.260 --> 00:33:28.790
and find a secret trap door.

00:33:28.790 --> 00:33:32.329
And they go down into the trap
door underneath the cellar,

00:33:32.329 --> 00:33:34.370
and they discover the
people living in that house

00:33:34.370 --> 00:33:40.190
are keeping human beings chained
up in that larder for food.

00:33:40.190 --> 00:33:43.355
They are eating them
a limb at a time.

00:33:43.355 --> 00:33:45.230
I mean, it's one of the
most horrible visions

00:33:45.230 --> 00:33:47.790
of hell on earth that
you could ever imagine.

00:33:47.790 --> 00:33:48.950
And they flee that house.

00:33:48.950 --> 00:33:52.220
They just manage to get away
as the owners of the house

00:33:52.220 --> 00:33:56.420
come back, and so it's very
clear that this is a really

00:33:56.420 --> 00:34:01.140
terrible world, and it's OK to
be afraid in a world like this,

00:34:01.140 --> 00:34:04.040
but one of the things that
the story keeps coming back to

00:34:04.040 --> 00:34:09.270
is the son keeps asking his
father, are we the good guys?

00:34:09.270 --> 00:34:11.094
So they have these
conversations,

00:34:11.094 --> 00:34:12.510
and the son asks
the father things

00:34:12.510 --> 00:34:15.690
like, we would never
eat anybody, right?

00:34:15.690 --> 00:34:19.480
No, we would never eat anybody,
and I know that sounds funny,

00:34:19.480 --> 00:34:24.179
but in a sort of metaphorical
way, it's OK for us

00:34:24.179 --> 00:34:25.659
to ask that question.

00:34:25.659 --> 00:34:27.630
We would never eat anybody.

00:34:27.630 --> 00:34:30.420
And there's actually this
sort of ongoing conversation

00:34:30.420 --> 00:34:34.139
that they have about how
they are carrying the light.

00:34:34.139 --> 00:34:35.280
They are the good guys.

00:34:35.280 --> 00:34:37.696
I mean, they've got to stay
alive because they're carrying

00:34:37.696 --> 00:34:42.239
the light, but the little boy
observes that, on their journey

00:34:42.239 --> 00:34:42.960
to the sea--

00:34:42.960 --> 00:34:46.920
they walk past a dog,
and a little boy,

00:34:46.920 --> 00:34:49.620
and an old man who's
been struck by lightning.

00:34:49.620 --> 00:34:52.199
And every time they encounter
somebody on the road

00:34:52.199 --> 00:34:55.440
the son says,
can't we help them?

00:34:55.440 --> 00:35:00.830
And the father
says, no, we can't.

00:35:00.830 --> 00:35:03.310
And those of us who are
parents or those of us who

00:35:03.310 --> 00:35:08.160
are in charge of somebody
understand that impulse,

00:35:08.160 --> 00:35:11.250
because the father is saying
I am responsible for you,

00:35:11.250 --> 00:35:15.390
and if we give this person
food or if we stop and help

00:35:15.390 --> 00:35:20.160
this person and they are a
decoy and we get captured--

00:35:20.160 --> 00:35:23.460
I mean, the chances of
something bad happening

00:35:23.460 --> 00:35:26.040
are too high for
us to be generous.

00:35:28.790 --> 00:35:30.950
And yet the boy keeps
asking with every encounter,

00:35:30.950 --> 00:35:31.910
can't we help them?

00:35:31.910 --> 00:35:33.680
Can't we help them?

00:35:33.680 --> 00:35:36.590
And finally they get toward
the end of the story,

00:35:36.590 --> 00:35:41.300
and I will leave the very last
part of the novel untouched,

00:35:41.300 --> 00:35:45.140
spoiler free, because it is
one of the very few slightly

00:35:45.140 --> 00:35:49.051
hopeful moments in the
oeuvre of Cormac McCarthy,

00:35:49.051 --> 00:35:51.050
and if you're actually
going to read this novel,

00:35:51.050 --> 00:35:53.420
I don't want to
spoil it for you.

00:35:53.420 --> 00:35:55.730
But the boy says
to his father, you

00:35:55.730 --> 00:35:58.550
say that we are the
good guys and that we're

00:35:58.550 --> 00:36:04.610
carrying the light, but we
don't ever do anything good.

00:36:04.610 --> 00:36:06.320
We don't ever help anyone.

00:36:09.195 --> 00:36:10.570
And it's kind of
a shattering out

00:36:10.570 --> 00:36:13.420
of the mouths of
babes kind of moment,

00:36:13.420 --> 00:36:15.040
because for those
of us as readers

00:36:15.040 --> 00:36:17.230
who have identified really
strongly with the father

00:36:17.230 --> 00:36:20.250
and understood the
decisions he makes,

00:36:20.250 --> 00:36:23.610
it suddenly places us in that
stark moment where we have

00:36:23.610 --> 00:36:28.390
to think about, oh, I get that.

00:36:28.390 --> 00:36:32.120
Pragmatically, he has made
really good decisions,

00:36:32.120 --> 00:36:35.650
but what do I do with
what the son is asking?

00:36:35.650 --> 00:36:41.891
How can we be the good guys
if we never do a good thing?

00:36:41.891 --> 00:36:43.390
Now, that does not
mean, by the way,

00:36:43.390 --> 00:36:44.800
that there is a
simple answer to this,

00:36:44.800 --> 00:36:47.091
because that's the thing
about the ethics of the zombie

00:36:47.091 --> 00:36:51.330
apocalypse and the ethics
of the post-9/11 world.

00:36:51.330 --> 00:36:54.300
The decisions are not easy.

00:36:54.300 --> 00:36:56.730
And I said in Oxford
yesterday I think of myself

00:36:56.730 --> 00:37:01.200
as a Christian pacifist, but
I remember a passage of one

00:37:01.200 --> 00:37:02.730
of Bono's interviews
where he said,

00:37:02.730 --> 00:37:05.190
I am a Christian
pacifist, and if somebody

00:37:05.190 --> 00:37:07.260
breaks into my house and
goes after my family,

00:37:07.260 --> 00:37:09.210
I will stop being a
Christian pacifist

00:37:09.210 --> 00:37:12.606
so fast it will
make your head spin,

00:37:12.606 --> 00:37:13.980
because one of
the things that we

00:37:13.980 --> 00:37:16.170
have to wrestle with
in the real world

00:37:16.170 --> 00:37:20.700
is, how do we live out
our ethical beliefs?

00:37:20.700 --> 00:37:24.340
There is a line in Harry
Potter where Dumbledore

00:37:24.340 --> 00:37:27.340
asks whether the
people listening will

00:37:27.340 --> 00:37:29.800
be able to do the
thing that is right

00:37:29.800 --> 00:37:32.844
or the thing that is easy.

00:37:32.844 --> 00:37:34.510
And again, there's
not an easy solution.

00:37:34.510 --> 00:37:36.370
I'm not advocating for
one over the other,

00:37:36.370 --> 00:37:38.800
and I can say that
I would be one

00:37:38.800 --> 00:37:40.480
of those Christian
pacifists who stopped

00:37:40.480 --> 00:37:43.300
being Christian pacifist so
quick it would make your head

00:37:43.300 --> 00:37:47.470
spin, but these stories
do make us think.

00:37:47.470 --> 00:37:49.060
They make us ask questions.

00:37:49.060 --> 00:37:51.280
They make us wonder if
we're doing the right thing

00:37:51.280 --> 00:37:55.050
or even what the
right thing might be.

00:37:55.050 --> 00:38:00.810
And I that's one of the great
services of them for us.

00:38:00.810 --> 00:38:03.349
So let me call sort of
a halt to the formal

00:38:03.349 --> 00:38:04.890
I want to talk to
you about this book

00:38:04.890 --> 00:38:08.460
and what I discovered
section, and I think

00:38:08.460 --> 00:38:11.070
we've got time for
some questions,

00:38:11.070 --> 00:38:12.600
and I hope you will ask some.

00:38:12.600 --> 00:38:14.730
I mean, I can talk a little
bit more if we need to,

00:38:14.730 --> 00:38:16.230
but I would really
love to know what

00:38:16.230 --> 00:38:19.410
you would like to hear about
and if there are questions

00:38:19.410 --> 00:38:21.390
or if there are
particular zombie texts

00:38:21.390 --> 00:38:25.050
that you're drawn
to or wonder about.

00:38:25.050 --> 00:38:26.220
So, anybody?

00:38:26.220 --> 00:38:28.386
Yes, right here in front.

00:38:28.386 --> 00:38:31.130
AUDIENCE: I like this idea that
you've drawn from this picture.

00:38:31.130 --> 00:38:31.970
Thanks.

00:38:31.970 --> 00:38:34.460
I like this idea you've
drawn from this picture

00:38:34.460 --> 00:38:38.480
from a museum like the image of
death you see on so many like--

00:38:38.480 --> 00:38:42.830
inside so many churches and so
many places to the zombies now

00:38:42.830 --> 00:38:45.950
and how it's kind of a guiding
light, in a way, about how

00:38:45.950 --> 00:38:49.580
we can live our lives, but
also the image of death

00:38:49.580 --> 00:38:52.202
as current society
sort of pictures it.

00:38:52.202 --> 00:38:54.410
So I just wonder if you've
given any thought to where

00:38:54.410 --> 00:38:55.610
that might go in the future.

00:38:55.610 --> 00:38:58.940
So we have zombies now just
like the image of death,

00:38:58.940 --> 00:39:02.150
I guess, was so prominent at
one point, which now people

00:39:02.150 --> 00:39:03.105
would just laugh at.

00:39:03.105 --> 00:39:05.480
I wonder if you'd given any
thought to where it could go.

00:39:05.480 --> 00:39:07.646
GREG GARRETT: Well, in the
first chapter that I just

00:39:07.646 --> 00:39:08.900
read to you from--

00:39:08.900 --> 00:39:11.630
I was hoping there were
going to be engineers here,

00:39:11.630 --> 00:39:15.710
because I found a mathematical
study where somebody used

00:39:15.710 --> 00:39:18.950
a model based on epidemiology--
sort of the spread

00:39:18.950 --> 00:39:20.270
of an epidemic--

00:39:20.270 --> 00:39:23.120
to think about how
much longer the zombie

00:39:23.120 --> 00:39:25.550
apocalypse is going
to be a powerful kind

00:39:25.550 --> 00:39:27.440
of pervasive story for us.

00:39:27.440 --> 00:39:30.596
And in the mathematical
model that they set out,

00:39:30.596 --> 00:39:31.970
they were saying
this is probably

00:39:31.970 --> 00:39:33.845
going to be one of our
most prominent stories

00:39:33.845 --> 00:39:35.870
for the next 30 or 40 years.

00:39:35.870 --> 00:39:37.329
Now, beyond that,
it's hard to say.

00:39:37.329 --> 00:39:39.494
One of the things that I
think is really interesting

00:39:39.494 --> 00:39:41.690
is that, as you look at
the different iterations

00:39:41.690 --> 00:39:44.060
in different historical
periods, they

00:39:44.060 --> 00:39:48.270
have found new ways
to use the old images.

00:39:48.270 --> 00:39:50.210
So if we say that,
in some sense,

00:39:50.210 --> 00:39:57.320
our zombies are a rebooting
of capital D Death--

00:39:57.320 --> 00:39:58.310
and I'll be honest.

00:39:58.310 --> 00:40:00.770
There are some pictures,
including this amazing picture

00:40:00.770 --> 00:40:04.790
from Bruegel, where there is
an army of the dead sweeping

00:40:04.790 --> 00:40:07.520
across the landscape, and
it looks like something out

00:40:07.520 --> 00:40:08.600
of "The Walking Dead."

00:40:08.600 --> 00:40:11.150
It just looks like, oh my
god, here they come, and it's

00:40:11.150 --> 00:40:15.200
the end of everything,
but I think probably what

00:40:15.200 --> 00:40:16.940
we're going to see
is, in the future,

00:40:16.940 --> 00:40:20.300
that there will be some new
kind of iteration of this that's

00:40:20.300 --> 00:40:25.770
appropriate for whatever
kinds of storytelling

00:40:25.770 --> 00:40:27.410
they have in that era.

00:40:27.410 --> 00:40:30.740
So 1968 when "Night of
the Living Dead" came out

00:40:30.740 --> 00:40:33.750
was one of the most horrific
years in American history,

00:40:33.750 --> 00:40:36.650
and it sort of makes
sense that, instead

00:40:36.650 --> 00:40:39.620
of being a poster, or
a stained glass image,

00:40:39.620 --> 00:40:43.400
or a bronze statue, it would
be a movie, because that,

00:40:43.400 --> 00:40:48.170
for Americans in 1968,
was the most powerful

00:40:48.170 --> 00:40:52.050
and the most consumed
form of storytelling.

00:40:52.050 --> 00:40:55.790
So I think we'll probably
see new versions of this,

00:40:55.790 --> 00:40:57.740
and we probably don't
know what that's

00:40:57.740 --> 00:40:59.323
going to look like
until we get there,

00:40:59.323 --> 00:41:01.700
but I mean, judging
from the last 600 years,

00:41:01.700 --> 00:41:05.320
there's going to be
some element of this

00:41:05.320 --> 00:41:10.310
in just whatever crazy virtual
reality storytelling we

00:41:10.310 --> 00:41:11.854
have 100 years down the road.

00:41:11.854 --> 00:41:13.710
AUDIENCE: Brought
to you by Google.

00:41:13.710 --> 00:41:17.055
GREG GARRETT: Yeah, brought
to you by Google, exactly.

00:41:17.055 --> 00:41:19.013
AUDIENCE: Sorry, what
was the backdrop to 1968?

00:41:19.013 --> 00:41:20.480
Was that civil rights?

00:41:20.480 --> 00:41:21.980
GREG GARRETT: Yeah, 1968--

00:41:21.980 --> 00:41:24.580
for those of you that are
not American history buffs,

00:41:24.580 --> 00:41:27.950
it's Vietnam War, assassinations
of Martin Luther King

00:41:27.950 --> 00:41:32.840
and Robert Kennedy, changes
in cultural and sexual mores,

00:41:32.840 --> 00:41:35.420
political unrest,
I mean, basically

00:41:35.420 --> 00:41:38.120
the whole sort of census
that we just talked about

00:41:38.120 --> 00:41:40.670
with the Middle Ages and
that we could sort of talk

00:41:40.670 --> 00:41:47.280
about in terms of our modern
sort of set of challenges.

00:41:47.280 --> 00:41:50.270
It's just sort of one
of those crazy things

00:41:50.270 --> 00:41:54.140
where George Romero
didn't know that 1968

00:41:54.140 --> 00:41:56.930
was going to be one of the
worst years in American history

00:41:56.930 --> 00:42:00.320
any more than the makers
of "28 Days Later"

00:42:00.320 --> 00:42:02.420
knew that 9/11 was
going to happen

00:42:02.420 --> 00:42:05.510
or U2 knew that they needed to
make an album that would make

00:42:05.510 --> 00:42:09.320
people feel better
about 9/11 happening,

00:42:09.320 --> 00:42:12.710
but that seems to be the
sort of strange conjunction

00:42:12.710 --> 00:42:15.740
that we find, that we say
that artists kind of tap

00:42:15.740 --> 00:42:18.800
in, in some way, to the
zeitgeist of a particular time

00:42:18.800 --> 00:42:22.400
and maybe are even ahead of
their time in anticipating.

00:42:22.400 --> 00:42:25.400
And it's kind of remarkable
when you think about them.

00:42:28.630 --> 00:42:33.020
AUDIENCE: I was just going to
ask-- the zombies, obviously,

00:42:33.020 --> 00:42:35.060
they are people who've died.

00:42:35.060 --> 00:42:38.194
They come back to life, but they
don't just come back to life

00:42:38.194 --> 00:42:39.860
and just start walking
around aimlessly.

00:42:39.860 --> 00:42:43.600
They come back to life and
then turn on the humans

00:42:43.600 --> 00:42:45.810
that they've been
with and oftentimes

00:42:45.810 --> 00:42:49.280
in a lot of recent
popular stuff they

00:42:49.280 --> 00:42:50.750
tend to turn on
the people who are

00:42:50.750 --> 00:42:53.540
closest to them first of all.

00:42:53.540 --> 00:42:56.930
Do you think that that is
just to emphasize the fear

00:42:56.930 --> 00:43:00.080
and therefore sort of
compound these themes

00:43:00.080 --> 00:43:01.675
that you were talking
about earlier,

00:43:01.675 --> 00:43:04.050
or do you think there might
be something more deep seated

00:43:04.050 --> 00:43:04.610
associated?

00:43:04.610 --> 00:43:06.890
GREG GARRETT: I think that's
a nice reading, actually.

00:43:06.890 --> 00:43:09.920
The remake of "Dawn of
the Dead," which is--

00:43:09.920 --> 00:43:14.420
the original one appeared in
the '80s, and this other one is

00:43:14.420 --> 00:43:18.207
post-9/11, but the remake--

00:43:18.207 --> 00:43:20.540
at the beginning of the film,
one of the main characters

00:43:20.540 --> 00:43:23.480
is attacked by the little
girl who lives across the hall

00:43:23.480 --> 00:43:27.050
and by her boyfriend, both of
whom have just become zombies.

00:43:27.050 --> 00:43:32.210
And so I think a part of
it may be that sort of fear

00:43:32.210 --> 00:43:34.570
of those who are closest to us.

00:43:34.570 --> 00:43:37.820
And if you go back to the 1968
"Night of the Living Dead,"

00:43:37.820 --> 00:43:41.300
maybe the most horrific
image from that film--

00:43:41.300 --> 00:43:44.030
there's a little girl
who turns into a zombie,

00:43:44.030 --> 00:43:44.990
kills her father--

00:43:44.990 --> 00:43:49.430
or eats her father, kills
her mother, and "Variety,"

00:43:49.430 --> 00:43:54.600
the great sort of trade
magazine of American film,

00:43:54.600 --> 00:43:57.230
said this is the most
reprehensible movie

00:43:57.230 --> 00:43:59.050
making that has ever been.

00:43:59.050 --> 00:44:01.460
The producers and
director of this film

00:44:01.460 --> 00:44:03.920
should be ashamed of themselves
for what they've done.

00:44:03.920 --> 00:44:06.070
I mean, it was shocking.

00:44:06.070 --> 00:44:08.390
It's still shocking
today, because we

00:44:08.390 --> 00:44:10.450
think the people
that we're closest to

00:44:10.450 --> 00:44:13.520
are the people with whom
we should feel safest,

00:44:13.520 --> 00:44:17.190
but a lot of times in the zombie
stories, as you point out,

00:44:17.190 --> 00:44:21.860
they are the first
people to be turned on.

00:44:21.860 --> 00:44:23.630
And I guess what
that does-- if we

00:44:23.630 --> 00:44:27.050
want to think about taking I
am afraid of Syrian refugees,

00:44:27.050 --> 00:44:29.600
or I am afraid of the
opposing political party,

00:44:29.600 --> 00:44:33.590
or I am afraid of walking out
my door and being blown up,

00:44:33.590 --> 00:44:36.300
but it also brings that
down to a domestic level.

00:44:36.300 --> 00:44:39.530
And a lot of horror
films do that, as well.

00:44:39.530 --> 00:44:41.960
So there's often a
societal level of fear

00:44:41.960 --> 00:44:45.380
that's dealt with in horror
films and a very personal kind

00:44:45.380 --> 00:44:47.890
of thing, which is, I think,
one of the things that

00:44:47.890 --> 00:44:49.820
does make it so scary.

00:44:49.820 --> 00:44:51.433
I mean, that's a
great observation.

00:45:00.130 --> 00:45:01.417
AUDIENCE: Thanks.

00:45:01.417 --> 00:45:03.250
You mentioned before
that "The Walking Dead"

00:45:03.250 --> 00:45:07.360
is one of the most popular
shows around, and at its heart,

00:45:07.360 --> 00:45:10.000
it's quite a cynical
show in terms of how it

00:45:10.000 --> 00:45:12.826
deals with humans and zombies.

00:45:12.826 --> 00:45:14.200
And in recent
years, there's been

00:45:14.200 --> 00:45:18.310
an influx of new material
that sort of humanizes zombies

00:45:18.310 --> 00:45:21.540
in a different way between
"The Girl With All the Gifts,"

00:45:21.540 --> 00:45:25.330
and "Warm Bodies,
"iZombie," and so on.

00:45:25.330 --> 00:45:28.540
To what do you attribute the
success of "The Walking Dead,"

00:45:28.540 --> 00:45:30.910
whereas these sort
of softer shows

00:45:30.910 --> 00:45:32.890
struggle to build or
maintain an audience?

00:45:32.890 --> 00:45:33.400
GREG GARRETT: I know.

00:45:33.400 --> 00:45:34.880
I mean, that's a really
interesting question.

00:45:34.880 --> 00:45:36.879
I think part of it is
that "The Walking Dead" is

00:45:36.879 --> 00:45:39.520
sort of straight down the
middle of the fairway in terms

00:45:39.520 --> 00:45:40.870
of the zombie narrative.

00:45:40.870 --> 00:45:45.580
And a show like "iZombie,"
as interesting and really

00:45:45.580 --> 00:45:48.430
human as it can be,
for whatever reason,

00:45:48.430 --> 00:45:52.590
doesn't have the same kind of
maybe mythic quality to it.

00:45:52.590 --> 00:45:54.490
And I think also
probably it lacks, just

00:45:54.490 --> 00:45:58.870
in terms of narrative, that
really compelling survival

00:45:58.870 --> 00:46:02.680
story that we find in "Walking
Dead," or "28 Days Later,"

00:46:02.680 --> 00:46:05.260
or any of the sort
of-- are these people

00:46:05.260 --> 00:46:07.870
that we've come to care
about going to last

00:46:07.870 --> 00:46:09.560
to the end of the story?

00:46:09.560 --> 00:46:13.060
So I think maybe that's
it in narrative terms.

00:46:13.060 --> 00:46:16.180
I wonder if those stories
where we humanize the zombies

00:46:16.180 --> 00:46:19.060
confuse us a little bit, too,
because we were saying earlier

00:46:19.060 --> 00:46:21.370
that it's kind of nice
to be able to look

00:46:21.370 --> 00:46:23.540
and kind of draw
some distinctions,

00:46:23.540 --> 00:46:27.610
but I know that many of the
stories where zombies are given

00:46:27.610 --> 00:46:31.910
agency and intelligence
are really difficult,

00:46:31.910 --> 00:46:34.057
because they're kind
of challenging for us.

00:46:34.057 --> 00:46:35.140
And I think particularly--

00:46:35.140 --> 00:46:36.910
I hope that some of
you will have a chance

00:46:36.910 --> 00:46:38.200
to encounter this--

00:46:38.200 --> 00:46:40.870
there is a best
selling comic series

00:46:40.870 --> 00:46:43.950
in the States called
"Marvel Zombies,"

00:46:43.950 --> 00:46:46.300
and in this series
of graphic novels,

00:46:46.300 --> 00:46:49.210
those iconic Marvel
characters like Spider-Man,

00:46:49.210 --> 00:46:53.980
and Iron Man, and all of the
other sort of iconic heroes

00:46:53.980 --> 00:47:00.280
are afflicted by a zombie virus,
and they become these consuming

00:47:00.280 --> 00:47:01.780
monsters.

00:47:01.780 --> 00:47:04.425
And for most of them, it's just
like, OK, they sort of give

00:47:04.425 --> 00:47:05.800
themselves over
to the dark side,

00:47:05.800 --> 00:47:08.133
but a couple of them, including
the Spider-Man character

00:47:08.133 --> 00:47:11.320
in this series, still have
enough kind of sentience to go,

00:47:11.320 --> 00:47:12.250
this is horrible.

00:47:12.250 --> 00:47:15.310
I can't believe
what we've become.

00:47:15.310 --> 00:47:17.850
And when I think about
all of the zombie stories

00:47:17.850 --> 00:47:20.820
that I read, or
looked at, or watched,

00:47:20.820 --> 00:47:22.860
the "Marvel Zombies"
story is one of the ones

00:47:22.860 --> 00:47:23.943
that keeps me up at night.

00:47:23.943 --> 00:47:26.130
And I think part of
it is just that it's

00:47:26.130 --> 00:47:28.680
kind of nice to sort of
feel good guy/bad guy,

00:47:28.680 --> 00:47:33.640
and not have to deal with that
really powerful gray area,

00:47:33.640 --> 00:47:35.020
but that's a lovely question.

00:47:35.020 --> 00:47:38.260
Thank you.

00:47:38.260 --> 00:47:41.150
AUDIENCE: Do you
touch in the book

00:47:41.150 --> 00:47:43.375
on the influence of
Michael Jackson and John

00:47:43.375 --> 00:47:46.589
Landis [INAUDIBLE]?

00:47:46.589 --> 00:47:48.880
GREG GARRETT: Not an awful
lot, except to sort of think

00:47:48.880 --> 00:47:53.869
about that as a
really good example,

00:47:53.869 --> 00:47:55.910
because what we're talking
about here, of course,

00:47:55.910 --> 00:47:58.660
is the "Thriller" video,
which, at the time it was made,

00:47:58.660 --> 00:48:00.790
was the most expensive
music video ever made.

00:48:00.790 --> 00:48:03.140
And it's a long sort of epic.

00:48:03.140 --> 00:48:05.290
AUDIENCE: It was the first
of its kind, actually.

00:48:05.290 --> 00:48:06.081
GREG GARRETT: Yeah.

00:48:06.081 --> 00:48:07.059
Yeah, absolutely.

00:48:07.059 --> 00:48:09.100
And I think what's sort
of interesting about that

00:48:09.100 --> 00:48:12.460
is that it was clear that,
for John Landis and Michael

00:48:12.460 --> 00:48:14.200
Jackson, they knew
that people would

00:48:14.200 --> 00:48:16.210
be familiar enough
with this story

00:48:16.210 --> 00:48:22.360
that they didn't have to do a
whole lot to sort of explain

00:48:22.360 --> 00:48:23.170
it.

00:48:23.170 --> 00:48:26.290
It's just like, OK,
this is a music video,

00:48:26.290 --> 00:48:28.780
and there are zombies,
and we kind of

00:48:28.780 --> 00:48:33.990
know what this all means because
we've seen this story before.

00:48:33.990 --> 00:48:35.950
And so I don't talk an
awful lot about that,

00:48:35.950 --> 00:48:37.060
but I think one
of the fun things

00:48:37.060 --> 00:48:38.518
about that is just
sort of thinking

00:48:38.518 --> 00:48:43.900
about that in terms of the kind
of popularity of the narrative.

00:48:43.900 --> 00:48:44.440
Good.

00:48:44.440 --> 00:48:46.390
Other questions?

00:48:46.390 --> 00:48:47.705
AUDIENCE: I have a question.

00:48:47.705 --> 00:48:49.330
When you were writing
the book, did you

00:48:49.330 --> 00:48:54.060
come across other sort of
creatures, monsters that just

00:48:54.060 --> 00:48:56.412
appeared as you were
researching zombies, and how

00:48:56.412 --> 00:48:57.370
did you deal with that?

00:48:57.370 --> 00:48:59.460
Did you think, oh,
this is another book,

00:48:59.460 --> 00:49:03.070
or I'll deal with
vampires later?

00:49:03.070 --> 00:49:06.280
And do you think that there are
different times and places that

00:49:06.280 --> 00:49:08.740
suit different types
of monsters better?

00:49:08.740 --> 00:49:10.990
So I think, thinking
about vampire stories,

00:49:10.990 --> 00:49:13.083
they tend to be
more love stories.

00:49:13.083 --> 00:49:15.849
Zombies don't touch so
much on love stories.

00:49:15.849 --> 00:49:17.890
GREG GARRETT: That actually
is a lovely question.

00:49:17.890 --> 00:49:21.842
This book is a sequel to my
first book for Oxford, which

00:49:21.842 --> 00:49:23.800
is a book called
"Entertaining Judgment," which

00:49:23.800 --> 00:49:26.710
is about narratives
of life after death,

00:49:26.710 --> 00:49:29.740
and there was a chapter in
that book on the undead.

00:49:29.740 --> 00:49:32.020
And it got bigger, and bigger,
and bigger, and bigger.

00:49:32.020 --> 00:49:33.500
It was 100 pages.

00:49:33.500 --> 00:49:36.760
It was past 100 pages
for a 300 page book,

00:49:36.760 --> 00:49:39.730
and it became very clear
that this was something

00:49:39.730 --> 00:49:42.340
that I couldn't really deal
with in the scope of a book

00:49:42.340 --> 00:49:44.740
and which I also wanted
to talk about people's

00:49:44.740 --> 00:49:48.610
conceptions of what
happens to us when we die.

00:49:48.610 --> 00:49:55.870
So vampires and ghosts are maybe
the other two really pervasive

00:49:55.870 --> 00:49:59.920
forms of the undead, and they do
kind of reflect different hopes

00:49:59.920 --> 00:50:01.420
and fears.

00:50:01.420 --> 00:50:03.730
And the vampire story,
as you were saying,

00:50:03.730 --> 00:50:06.040
is often tied to a love story.

00:50:06.040 --> 00:50:10.510
And the vampire is, at
least in some appearances,

00:50:10.510 --> 00:50:13.750
it looks like the things
that we seem to want most--

00:50:13.750 --> 00:50:16.000
eternal life, eternal youth--

00:50:16.000 --> 00:50:20.950
but in most of the sort of
classic Bram Stoker version

00:50:20.950 --> 00:50:24.040
vampire stories, there
is a very real cost

00:50:24.040 --> 00:50:28.130
to be paid for those
really cool things.

00:50:28.130 --> 00:50:31.720
So when you see the
representation of Dracula,

00:50:31.720 --> 00:50:33.970
say, in a down moment
when nobody's looking

00:50:33.970 --> 00:50:37.060
and you realize that he's
this hideous old man,

00:50:37.060 --> 00:50:39.970
or when you think
about what you have

00:50:39.970 --> 00:50:43.560
to do to earn eternal
life and eternal youth,

00:50:43.560 --> 00:50:48.130
and you've got to be
a monster devouring,

00:50:48.130 --> 00:50:52.880
drinking blood for the rest
of your eternal life, that's

00:50:52.880 --> 00:50:55.450
super scary.

00:50:55.450 --> 00:50:57.970
The ghost thing is kind of fun,
because in a lot of stories,

00:50:57.970 --> 00:51:02.140
it ties into the kind of
mega narrative of purgatory.

00:51:02.140 --> 00:51:04.690
And in many of our
stories of ghosts,

00:51:04.690 --> 00:51:06.804
it's about I have
this sort of phase

00:51:06.804 --> 00:51:08.470
that I've got to go
through or something

00:51:08.470 --> 00:51:10.390
that I've got to
accomplish before I

00:51:10.390 --> 00:51:12.620
move on to what's next.

00:51:12.620 --> 00:51:16.960
So there's the Patrick
Swayze/Demi Moore film "Ghost"

00:51:16.960 --> 00:51:19.990
in which, once he's done the
thing that he's there to do,

00:51:19.990 --> 00:51:21.070
he can move on.

00:51:21.070 --> 00:51:23.950
And for many people,
"The Sixth Sense"

00:51:23.950 --> 00:51:26.150
is one of the great ghost
stories of all time,

00:51:26.150 --> 00:51:28.810
and it's really sort of
straight up purgatory.

00:51:28.810 --> 00:51:31.630
It's like, I've got this time
that I've got to do this thing,

00:51:31.630 --> 00:51:35.950
and when it's done, I'm going
to go on to whatever's next.

00:51:35.950 --> 00:51:39.040
So I think the ghost
story a lot of times

00:51:39.040 --> 00:51:41.560
can be a really
human story for us,

00:51:41.560 --> 00:51:44.260
because we all have this idea
that there are phases that we

00:51:44.260 --> 00:51:45.910
go through in our
lives-- what I found

00:51:45.910 --> 00:51:48.400
about purgatory in the
last book was that it's

00:51:48.400 --> 00:51:50.230
kind of the narrative
that we come back to

00:51:50.230 --> 00:51:52.600
over and over again.

00:51:52.600 --> 00:51:56.200
Something terrible happens in
the first act of every story,

00:51:56.200 --> 00:51:58.810
and it gets more complicated,
and it gets resolved,

00:51:58.810 --> 00:52:00.700
and the story ends.

00:52:00.700 --> 00:52:03.280
And so that purgatory
sort of meta narrative

00:52:03.280 --> 00:52:07.630
is actually kind of the
pattern for every great story.

00:52:07.630 --> 00:52:11.470
And some of those ghost stories
are just really good examples

00:52:11.470 --> 00:52:14.050
of that because there's the
supernatural after death

00:52:14.050 --> 00:52:17.080
element of it that ties it
to the purgatory story even

00:52:17.080 --> 00:52:17.580
stronger.

00:52:23.801 --> 00:52:25.300
AUDIENCE: Thank you
very much, Greg.

00:52:25.300 --> 00:52:26.420
That was brilliant.

00:52:26.420 --> 00:52:27.795
GREG GARRETT: You
are so welcome.

00:52:27.795 --> 00:52:30.600
[APPLAUSE]
