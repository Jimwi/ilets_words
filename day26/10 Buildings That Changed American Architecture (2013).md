00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.950
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:02.950 --> 00:00:07.083
How did these 10
buildings change America?

00:00:07.083 --> 00:00:09.100
This Frank Lloyd
Wright house might

00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:12.250
have inspired the
design for your house.

00:00:12.250 --> 00:00:14.150
This New York
skyscraper just may

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:16.500
have been the model for
your office building.

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:18.666
And copies of this
Boston landmark

00:00:18.666 --> 00:00:21.550
are probably all around you.

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:22.783
I'm Geoffrey Baer.

00:00:22.783 --> 00:00:25.250
In this show, I'll be
crisscrossing the country

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:26.966
to visit 10 buildings
that changed

00:00:26.966 --> 00:00:30.416
the way we all live,
work, and play.

00:00:30.416 --> 00:00:34.133
Houses, skyscrapers, a
factory, and an airport.

00:00:34.133 --> 00:00:35.700
Even a shopping mall.

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:37.016
Just take a look.

00:00:37.016 --> 00:00:40.433
Each of these buildings was
revolutionary in its time,

00:00:40.433 --> 00:00:42.816
and then went on to
be a trendsetter.

00:00:42.816 --> 00:00:46.350
This building is not
like all those knockoffs.

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:48.833
We'll go inside these
seminal structures

00:00:48.833 --> 00:00:51.116
to see what makes
them extraordinary.

00:00:51.116 --> 00:00:54.316
The most complicated piece
to build is right there.

00:00:54.316 --> 00:00:57.500
We'll meet the daring architects
and adventuresome clients

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:59.250
who brought the
buildings to life.

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:00.750
If you're going to
build a building,

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:03.400
then you do the best
building that you can.

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:07.566
And we'll discover the shocking,
funny, and even sad stories

00:01:07.566 --> 00:01:09.866
of how these
buildings came to be.

00:01:09.866 --> 00:01:11.766
By the time this
show is finished,

00:01:11.766 --> 00:01:13.566
you'll look at
buildings all around you

00:01:13.566 --> 00:01:15.833
in a totally different way.

00:01:15.833 --> 00:01:20.016
Because they just may have been
inspired by these 10 buildings

00:01:20.016 --> 00:01:21.383
that changed America.

00:01:31.616 --> 00:01:36.200
From Washington, DC,
to Madison, Wisconsin,

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:40.100
and all over America,
government buildings

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:43.350
often look like Greek
and Roman temples.

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:46.300
So where did this
tradition begin?

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:48.950
The answer is in
Richmond, Virginia,

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:51.116
where we start our
journey through time

00:01:51.116 --> 00:01:52.750
with the oldest of
our 10 buildings.

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:59.116
When Thomas Jefferson first
laid eyes on this building,

00:01:59.116 --> 00:02:00.416
he wasn't happy.

00:02:00.416 --> 00:02:02.433
He is not pleased.

00:02:02.433 --> 00:02:04.950
The founding father and
self-taught architect

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:07.433
had designed the
Virginia State Capitol

00:02:07.433 --> 00:02:09.883
while living 4,000 miles away.

00:02:09.883 --> 00:02:12.300
Jefferson is
contacted in France.

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:13.866
But when he got
back to Richmond,

00:02:13.866 --> 00:02:15.983
he found his building
had been enlarged,

00:02:15.983 --> 00:02:18.200
the offices were
moved to the basement,

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:21.400
and his grand front
steps were eliminated.

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:25.350
He comes back and he realizes
there are no front steps.

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:26.933
This was always
intended, that there

00:02:26.933 --> 00:02:29.000
would be these
magnificent front steps.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:30.650
That you would
come up this hill.

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:33.533
There would be this
temple on the hilltop.

00:02:33.533 --> 00:02:36.616
A decade after Thomas Jefferson
penned the Declaration

00:02:36.616 --> 00:02:39.050
of Independence, this
building was sort of

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:42.450
like his declaration of
architectural independence

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:44.933
from Britain.

00:02:44.933 --> 00:02:47.616
You see, he never really liked
the Colonial architecture

00:02:47.616 --> 00:02:49.466
of Virginia.

00:02:49.466 --> 00:02:53.166
As an architect, it offended
Jefferson's sense of style.

00:02:53.166 --> 00:02:56.700
And as a revolutionary, it
clashed with his politics.

00:02:56.700 --> 00:03:00.816
This was, after all, Georgian
architecture, a style

00:03:00.816 --> 00:03:04.800
imported from Britain
and named for its kings.

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:06.616
Even the name,
Georgian architecture.

00:03:06.616 --> 00:03:08.116
It was horrible.

00:03:08.116 --> 00:03:11.783
Jefferson hated kings and the
Declaration of Independence

00:03:11.783 --> 00:03:15.916
is essentially his Dear
John letter to George III.

00:03:15.916 --> 00:03:19.333
Jefferson was invited to
create a new face for Virginia

00:03:19.333 --> 00:03:22.500
while he was serving as
America's Minister to France.

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:24.816
But he didn't find his
architectural inspirational

00:03:24.816 --> 00:03:27.483
in the court of King Louis XVI.

00:03:27.483 --> 00:03:29.433
Instead, Jefferson
looked back to

00:03:29.433 --> 00:03:31.900
the great classical
buildings of Rome,

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:34.666
which he knew so well from
his architecture books.

00:03:34.666 --> 00:03:35.700
He liked the clean lines.

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:37.250
He liked the symmetry.

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:39.966
And this was his statement
about the new nation being

00:03:39.966 --> 00:03:42.500
a part of the Western world,
but not being beholden

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:43.866
to Great Britain.

00:03:43.866 --> 00:03:47.183
But rather than simply borrow
ideas from the ancients,

00:03:47.183 --> 00:03:50.416
Thomas Jefferson decided
to do something unheard of.

00:03:50.416 --> 00:03:54.683
His state capitol would be
a copy of an actual Roman

00:03:54.683 --> 00:03:58.100
temple, the Maison Carree
in the south of France.

00:03:58.100 --> 00:04:00.750
Jefferson writes
somewhat lasciviously

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:04.366
about his first face-to-face
encounter with the temple.

00:04:04.366 --> 00:04:08.566
"Here I am, gazing whole
hours at the Maison Carree,

00:04:08.566 --> 00:04:10.700
like a lover at his mistress.

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:13.033
And the reason why you
picks the Maison Carree,

00:04:13.033 --> 00:04:17.116
a square building, is
to embody ancient ideals

00:04:17.116 --> 00:04:19.283
of pure geometry.

00:04:19.283 --> 00:04:23.216
The Maison Carree is a
one-room windowless temple, not

00:04:23.216 --> 00:04:25.683
an ideal vessel for
state government.

00:04:25.683 --> 00:04:28.550
So with the help of French
architect Charles-Louis

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:32.466
Clerisseau, Jefferson made
a few practical changes.

00:04:32.466 --> 00:04:36.316
While the Maison Carree sported
fancy Corinthian columns,

00:04:36.316 --> 00:04:37.750
he thought the
workmen in Virginia

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:40.550
could only handle
simpler, ionic ones.

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:45.566
Because the ionic order
are much easier to carve.

00:04:45.566 --> 00:04:47.250
And where, in a
Roman temple, there

00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:49.266
might have been a
statue of a god,

00:04:49.266 --> 00:04:53.383
Jefferson planned for a statue
of America's first president.

00:04:53.383 --> 00:04:55.833
It looks remarkably
different from the image

00:04:55.833 --> 00:04:59.016
of George Washington
we all know.

00:04:59.016 --> 00:05:01.266
I don't think that's
the same likeness.

00:05:01.266 --> 00:05:04.250
In fact, this is considered
the most accurate likeness

00:05:04.250 --> 00:05:06.216
we have Washington.

00:05:06.216 --> 00:05:08.916
It was based on an
actual mold of his face.

00:05:08.916 --> 00:05:12.466
He is not presented as a king.

00:05:12.466 --> 00:05:15.883
Notice that there is a
missing button on the coat.

00:05:15.883 --> 00:05:17.716
There's a slight
swelling to the belly--

00:05:17.716 --> 00:05:18.233
[LAUGHTER]

00:05:18.233 --> 00:05:19.600
--one might say there.

00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:22.400
Jefferson may have been
an ocean away in France,

00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:24.900
but he still tried to
micromanage construction

00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:26.233
of the capitol.

00:05:26.233 --> 00:05:29.116
He shipped this scale
model back to Virginia,

00:05:29.116 --> 00:05:31.900
which remarkably survives today.

00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:35.150
Plus, these obsessively
detailed drawings.

00:05:35.150 --> 00:05:38.983
This was an obsessive individual
with many different area.

00:05:38.983 --> 00:05:39.483
[LAUGHTER]

00:05:40.016 --> 00:05:43.050
He sometimes would
draw up his buildings

00:05:43.050 --> 00:05:46.550
with measurements down to
one one-hundredth of an inch.

00:05:46.550 --> 00:05:49.716
Now, can you imagine a
workman looking at that?

00:05:49.716 --> 00:05:53.633
It's likely that some of
those workmen were slaves.

00:05:53.633 --> 00:05:55.850
Jefferson suggested
that slaves work

00:05:55.850 --> 00:05:59.166
under the direction of
an expert stone-cutter.

00:05:59.166 --> 00:06:00.650
This is similar
to the arrangement

00:06:00.650 --> 00:06:03.083
he used to build his
home, Monticello.

00:06:03.083 --> 00:06:05.366
So this is something that he
would have been very, very

00:06:05.366 --> 00:06:08.366
familiar with from
his own experiences.

00:06:08.366 --> 00:06:11.100
But Thomas Jefferson's
attempts to oversee the project

00:06:11.100 --> 00:06:13.316
from afar fell apart.

00:06:13.316 --> 00:06:15.950
His plans took months
to reach Richmond.

00:06:15.950 --> 00:06:18.666
In the meantime,
legislatures grew impatient

00:06:18.666 --> 00:06:22.850
and the builder broke ground on
an entirely different design.

00:06:22.850 --> 00:06:25.066
Once the plans do get
over here, they've

00:06:25.066 --> 00:06:26.383
already started the building.

00:06:26.383 --> 00:06:28.500
They've already got
a foundation there.

00:06:28.500 --> 00:06:31.316
And that resulted in some
of those troublesome changes

00:06:31.316 --> 00:06:34.866
to Jefferson's design, like
leaving off his grand front

00:06:34.866 --> 00:06:38.616
steps, which wouldn't be
added until after his death.

00:06:38.616 --> 00:06:40.616
Still, Jefferson's
building would

00:06:40.616 --> 00:06:43.400
change American architecture.

00:06:43.400 --> 00:06:46.566
The Virginia State Capitol
inspired American architects

00:06:46.566 --> 00:06:50.100
to use the classical temple
form as the official face

00:06:50.100 --> 00:06:51.866
of this new nation.

00:06:51.866 --> 00:06:55.250
This was the first
republic of the modern era

00:06:55.250 --> 00:06:58.966
to turn away from
monarchy permanently.

00:06:58.966 --> 00:07:03.200
And this was a radical, it
was new, it was dangerous.

00:07:03.200 --> 00:07:07.866
And they announced all of this
with Greco-Roman architecture.

00:07:15.316 --> 00:07:17.133
Wherever you live
in America, you've

00:07:17.133 --> 00:07:21.150
probably seen buildings that
look like this Boston landmark.

00:07:21.150 --> 00:07:24.050
Churches, city halls,
and post offices

00:07:24.050 --> 00:07:27.933
with heavy walls of rough
faced stone, round arches,

00:07:27.933 --> 00:07:30.133
and massive towers.

00:07:30.133 --> 00:07:33.833
This style is called
Richardsonian Romanesque,

00:07:33.833 --> 00:07:37.766
and it was born right
here at Trinity Church.

00:07:37.766 --> 00:07:41.566
The architect, much like his
building, was mountainous.

00:07:41.566 --> 00:07:44.266
He weighed, in his
prime-- if that

00:07:44.266 --> 00:07:47.100
was what we could call
it-- over 300 pounds.

00:07:47.100 --> 00:07:50.666
H. H. Richardson was a
celebrity in the 1880s who

00:07:50.666 --> 00:07:53.350
famously dressed in a
Medieval monk's robe

00:07:53.350 --> 00:07:55.700
and lived a very short life.

00:07:55.700 --> 00:07:59.200
He got his chance to change the
face of American architecture

00:07:59.200 --> 00:08:02.300
when he was just
33-- this invitation

00:08:02.300 --> 00:08:05.500
to compete for the job of
designing Trinity Church.

00:08:05.500 --> 00:08:07.966
Richardson flipped
the invitation over

00:08:07.966 --> 00:08:10.333
and sketched this
design on the back.

00:08:10.333 --> 00:08:13.950
This little sketch is really
the embryo of this church.

00:08:13.950 --> 00:08:17.216
It's like the conception
of a baby in the womb.

00:08:17.216 --> 00:08:21.350
Richardson made his visionary
sketch with one man in mind--

00:08:21.350 --> 00:08:24.816
Phillips Brooks was the
rector of Trinity Church.

00:08:24.816 --> 00:08:27.816
Today, he's best remembered
as the writer of the Christmas

00:08:27.816 --> 00:08:31.400
song "O Little Town of
Bethlehem," but in hi time

00:08:31.400 --> 00:08:34.316
he was known as a
spellbinding preacher who

00:08:34.316 --> 00:08:36.500
drew enormous crowds.

00:08:36.500 --> 00:08:40.000
The church is an
envelope for his voice.

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:43.600
Richardson designed Trinity
as a compact cross, which

00:08:43.600 --> 00:08:48.416
would draw more than 1,400
parishioners around rooks

00:08:48.416 --> 00:08:52.150
in a sanctuary adorned by some
of the great decorative artists

00:08:52.150 --> 00:08:53.583
of the day.

00:08:53.583 --> 00:08:57.316
It's a space that draws you in.

00:08:57.316 --> 00:09:00.200
You walk in and you
immediately feel

00:09:00.200 --> 00:09:02.333
that you're part
of a congregation.

00:09:02.333 --> 00:09:05.150
The other key to Richardson's
influential design

00:09:05.150 --> 00:09:07.550
was something of
a happy accident.

00:09:07.550 --> 00:09:09.766
Richardson originally
drew up Trinity

00:09:09.766 --> 00:09:13.350
with a tall, spindly tower,
but the building's engineers

00:09:13.350 --> 00:09:16.883
knew that idea was
literally on shaky ground.

00:09:16.883 --> 00:09:17.850
The engineers said, no.

00:09:17.850 --> 00:09:19.066
You can't do that.

00:09:19.066 --> 00:09:24.033
You see, this Boston's Back Bay,
a man-made piece of real estate

00:09:24.033 --> 00:09:27.166
that had been created by filling
in an old marsh with gravel

00:09:27.166 --> 00:09:28.400
and sand.

00:09:28.400 --> 00:09:31.650
The engineers knew the
unstable ground here just

00:09:31.650 --> 00:09:34.200
couldn't support
such a tall tower.

00:09:34.200 --> 00:09:36.500
So Richardson was
forced to adopt

00:09:36.500 --> 00:09:39.133
what would become Trinity's
defining feature--

00:09:39.133 --> 00:09:42.200
a broad, earthbound tower.

00:09:42.200 --> 00:09:45.200
It's held up by
four piers, which

00:09:45.200 --> 00:09:47.716
run down through the
corners of the sanctuary

00:09:47.716 --> 00:09:50.200
where they won't block
views of the preacher.

00:09:50.200 --> 00:09:53.650
These piers are supported
by huge granite footings

00:09:53.650 --> 00:09:58.566
below the church, which rests on
4,500 wood pilings, essentially

00:09:58.566 --> 00:10:02.300
tree trunks, that were driven
into the gravelly ground.

00:10:02.300 --> 00:10:04.866
And they push each other
so that they're stable.

00:10:04.866 --> 00:10:07.650
The broad tower
and boxy sanctuary

00:10:07.650 --> 00:10:10.966
came together to make
that mountainous form,

00:10:10.966 --> 00:10:13.100
which Richardson
married with his take

00:10:13.100 --> 00:10:17.066
on the muscular Romanesque
style of Medieval Europe.

00:10:17.066 --> 00:10:21.016
The result was something
entirely new-- Richardsonian

00:10:21.016 --> 00:10:22.100
Romanesque.

00:10:22.100 --> 00:10:23.816
It's a fantastic
kind of architecture.

00:10:23.816 --> 00:10:27.950
It's very massive with
these fantastic arches

00:10:27.950 --> 00:10:30.766
and this articulated
masonry that really looks

00:10:30.766 --> 00:10:34.366
as if it was chiseled right
out of rock on the site.

00:10:34.366 --> 00:10:37.666
It's a style with Old
World roots transformed

00:10:37.666 --> 00:10:41.283
into something fresh
and distinctly American.

00:10:41.283 --> 00:10:44.350
This grew out of a golden
age after the Civil War,

00:10:44.350 --> 00:10:47.050
when the nation's painters,
writers, and architects

00:10:47.050 --> 00:10:51.033
were all enjoying a so-called
American Renaissance.

00:10:51.033 --> 00:10:53.050
Richardson's work
as an architect

00:10:53.050 --> 00:10:57.466
reflected the sense of
optimism and exuberance

00:10:57.466 --> 00:10:59.933
about the American future.

00:10:59.933 --> 00:11:03.716
Richardson would die at
age 47, just nine years

00:11:03.716 --> 00:11:05.416
after completing Trinity.

00:11:05.416 --> 00:11:08.800
But his Richardsonian
Romanesque lived on.

00:11:08.800 --> 00:11:11.000
This style that
was born in Boston

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:14.566
was adopted by other
architects across America.

00:11:14.566 --> 00:11:17.600
Richardsonian Romanesque
took America by storm.

00:11:17.600 --> 00:11:18.333
It's everywhere.

00:11:18.333 --> 00:11:20.550
And it really goes to building
type to building type.

00:11:20.550 --> 00:11:21.583
It can be a church.

00:11:21.583 --> 00:11:23.366
It can be a library.

00:11:23.366 --> 00:11:26.216
These were institutions
that were building a nation.

00:11:26.216 --> 00:11:28.000
They all wanted to make
that same message--

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:29.383
that they were there to stay.

00:11:29.383 --> 00:11:33.566
And I would suggest that
it was its solidity.

00:11:33.566 --> 00:11:36.700
Its sense of having
been there a long time

00:11:36.700 --> 00:11:40.066
and likely to be there a
long time in the future.

00:11:47.650 --> 00:11:49.100
It might seem an obvious.

00:11:49.100 --> 00:11:52.350
Skyscrapers should look tall.

00:11:52.350 --> 00:11:56.416
But they never did until
this Saint Louis skyscraper

00:11:56.416 --> 00:11:59.550
reached toward the
heavens in 1891.

00:11:59.550 --> 00:12:03.033
The thing about the Wainwright
that's so extraordinary

00:12:03.033 --> 00:12:06.616
is it's the first building
that revels in the height.

00:12:06.616 --> 00:12:09.616
Not just that it can
go up the ten stories,

00:12:09.616 --> 00:12:13.183
but that it can do
that in a lyrical way.

00:12:13.183 --> 00:12:16.200
Louis Sullivan claimed to
have designed the Wainwright

00:12:16.200 --> 00:12:18.666
building in just three minutes.

00:12:18.666 --> 00:12:22.200
But in reality, he was building
on a decade of discoveries

00:12:22.200 --> 00:12:23.116
by other architects.

00:12:29.566 --> 00:12:32.816
The skyscraper was
born in the 1880s, when

00:12:32.816 --> 00:12:35.266
growing American
corporations were competing

00:12:35.266 --> 00:12:39.416
for prime downtown office
space in New York and Chicago.

00:12:39.416 --> 00:12:42.916
That drove real estate
prices through the roof.

00:12:42.916 --> 00:12:44.966
So the clients
and the architects

00:12:44.966 --> 00:12:48.566
want to figure out how to make
buildings that are taller.

00:12:48.566 --> 00:12:51.683
Architects answered the
call with new technologies,

00:12:51.683 --> 00:12:54.733
most importantly something
called skeleton frame

00:12:54.733 --> 00:12:56.416
construction.

00:12:56.416 --> 00:12:57.966
Instead of holding
up their buildings

00:12:57.966 --> 00:13:01.016
with thick masonry walls
of brick and stone,

00:13:01.016 --> 00:13:03.816
architects found a new way
to support tall buildings

00:13:03.816 --> 00:13:07.916
with thin metal frames and
the walls were mostly there

00:13:07.916 --> 00:13:11.516
to keep people
inside warm and dry.

00:13:11.516 --> 00:13:14.166
Another invention that make
the skyscraper possible

00:13:14.166 --> 00:13:15.866
was the passenger elevator.

00:13:15.866 --> 00:13:19.866
After all, who wants to
work in a ten story walk-up?

00:13:19.866 --> 00:13:21.916
Ten, please.

00:13:21.916 --> 00:13:24.200
So architects had
all the technology

00:13:24.200 --> 00:13:26.566
they needed to build
tall, but they still

00:13:26.566 --> 00:13:30.000
hadn't figured out what tall
buildings should look like.

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:33.500
So a lot of tall buildings look
like short buildings just made

00:13:33.500 --> 00:13:34.316
bigger.

00:13:34.316 --> 00:13:38.333
Or, like, in some cases even,
two or three short buildings

00:13:38.333 --> 00:13:40.316
piled on top of each other.

00:13:40.316 --> 00:13:43.183
Louis Sullivan felt this
new American invention

00:13:43.183 --> 00:13:47.016
known as the skyscraper
called for a new approach.

00:13:47.016 --> 00:13:50.150
"The skyscraper," he wrote,
"must be every inch a proud

00:13:50.150 --> 00:13:52.416
and soaring thing."

00:13:52.416 --> 00:13:56.733
Height was not just a fact, but
it was also an aesthetic idea.

00:13:56.733 --> 00:14:00.066
And yet when Sullivan sat
down to design this skyscraper

00:14:00.066 --> 00:14:03.500
for beer brewer Ellis Wainwright
and his mother Catherine,

00:14:03.500 --> 00:14:06.366
the architect was
reportedly stumped.

00:14:06.366 --> 00:14:10.200
So he went for a walk
to clear his head.

00:14:10.200 --> 00:14:12.650
The fresh air must've
done him some good,

00:14:12.650 --> 00:14:15.400
because as Sullivan walked
down this Chicago street,

00:14:15.400 --> 00:14:18.350
the design suddenly came to him.

00:14:18.350 --> 00:14:22.166
He rushed back inside and fired
off his famous three minute

00:14:22.166 --> 00:14:23.166
sketch.

00:14:23.166 --> 00:14:25.266
Sullivan threw the
sketch down on the table

00:14:25.266 --> 00:14:27.316
of his young draftsman,
Frank Lloyd Wright.

00:14:27.316 --> 00:14:29.733
And the Wainwright
Building in Saint Louis--

00:14:29.733 --> 00:14:32.316
More than 60 years later,
Wright recalled the moment

00:14:32.316 --> 00:14:34.500
when the Wainwright
Building was born.

00:14:34.500 --> 00:14:38.850
He said, Wright,
this thing is tall.

00:14:38.850 --> 00:14:40.516
What's the matter
with a tall building?

00:14:40.516 --> 00:14:41.533
And there it was.

00:14:41.533 --> 00:14:43.016
Tall.

00:14:43.016 --> 00:14:45.566
So how did Sullivan
make the skyscraper

00:14:45.566 --> 00:14:49.300
soar despite the fact that
it's only ten stories tall?

00:14:49.300 --> 00:14:51.283
Well, for starters, he
divided the building

00:14:51.283 --> 00:14:55.450
into three parts, what's
known as a tripartite design.

00:14:55.450 --> 00:14:57.866
First, there's the
two-story base.

00:14:57.866 --> 00:15:01.850
Two stories visually
made it look solid.

00:15:01.850 --> 00:15:06.366
But it also gave it that kind
of comfortable human scale.

00:15:06.366 --> 00:15:10.416
Then, above the base,
you here have floor

00:15:10.416 --> 00:15:13.933
upon floor of identical offices.

00:15:13.933 --> 00:15:16.166
This second part is
where Sullivan really

00:15:16.166 --> 00:15:18.200
draws your eye upward.

00:15:18.200 --> 00:15:20.516
The horizontal
elements, or spandrels,

00:15:20.516 --> 00:15:23.766
are recessed while the
vertical piers project

00:15:23.766 --> 00:15:26.666
without interruption
for seven stories.

00:15:26.666 --> 00:15:30.100
Almost until it reaches
the top of the building.

00:15:30.100 --> 00:15:33.800
But then, a building
has to end somewhere.

00:15:33.800 --> 00:15:35.850
That's the third
party of the building.

00:15:35.850 --> 00:15:39.483
And so then, these
vertical lines,

00:15:39.483 --> 00:15:43.766
as they reach the very top,
suddenly burst into ornament.

00:15:43.766 --> 00:15:46.583
The terracotta ornament
doesn't feature

00:15:46.583 --> 00:15:49.316
the columns of ancient
Greece and Rome.

00:15:49.316 --> 00:15:52.816
Instead, Sullivan
looks to nature.

00:15:52.816 --> 00:15:54.850
All the while,
Sullivan doesn't let

00:15:54.850 --> 00:15:57.500
us forget the technology
that made skyscrapers

00:15:57.500 --> 00:15:59.716
possible in the first place.

00:15:59.716 --> 00:16:02.400
While earlier skyscrapers
almost seemed ashamed

00:16:02.400 --> 00:16:05.300
of their steel frames,
the Wainwright Building

00:16:05.300 --> 00:16:07.450
emphasizes its skeleton.

00:16:07.450 --> 00:16:09.900
The steel frame's the
essence of the building.

00:16:09.900 --> 00:16:11.050
It's what makes it stand.

00:16:11.050 --> 00:16:12.566
It's symbolic of the time.

00:16:12.566 --> 00:16:15.233
It's symbolic of the technology.

00:16:15.233 --> 00:16:16.800
The Wainwright
Building set the tone

00:16:16.800 --> 00:16:20.483
for the next century of
skyscraper construction.

00:16:20.483 --> 00:16:24.283
Skyscrapers would continue
to celebrate their height,

00:16:24.283 --> 00:16:27.850
and they would continue to
show off their steel frames.

00:16:27.850 --> 00:16:30.950
But ultimately, Sullivan felt
the best form of flattery

00:16:30.950 --> 00:16:34.566
was not imitation,
but individualism.

00:16:34.566 --> 00:16:37.416
Part of what Sullivan felt
was important about the United

00:16:37.416 --> 00:16:40.716
States and America was the
power of the individual

00:16:40.716 --> 00:16:45.383
to express themselves for
the benefit of everybody.

00:16:45.383 --> 00:16:48.850
And if you have each person
taking their own talents

00:16:48.850 --> 00:16:51.866
and bringing buildings
vibrantly alive,

00:16:51.866 --> 00:16:55.833
you are creating an
American architecture.

00:16:55.833 --> 00:16:58.800
We're visiting 10 buildings
that changed America

00:16:58.800 --> 00:17:00.700
in chronological
order, and we've

00:17:00.700 --> 00:17:04.550
come to our fourth building.

00:17:04.550 --> 00:17:06.816
It's architect
called it a source

00:17:06.816 --> 00:17:09.900
of worldwide
architectural inspiration.

00:17:09.900 --> 00:17:14.066
Humility wasn't Frank
Lloyd Wright's strong suit.

00:17:14.066 --> 00:17:17.516
You see, early in life I to
choose between honest arrogance

00:17:17.516 --> 00:17:21.816
and hypocritical humility.

00:17:21.816 --> 00:17:24.033
I chose honest arrogance.

00:17:24.033 --> 00:17:27.166
The Robie House really
was a radical departure

00:17:27.166 --> 00:17:29.966
from your typical middle-class
house at the time, which

00:17:29.966 --> 00:17:32.616
tended to look like a tall box.

00:17:32.616 --> 00:17:34.766
Ever since he left
Louis Sullivan's office,

00:17:34.766 --> 00:17:37.050
Frank Lloyd Wright had
been gradually thinking

00:17:37.050 --> 00:17:41.366
outside the box in a series of
designs leading up to Robie.

00:17:41.366 --> 00:17:44.766
Wright was evolving
from a sort of tighter,

00:17:44.766 --> 00:17:49.400
more formal gabled house
to getting-- the gable

00:17:49.400 --> 00:17:51.833
is getting lower
and more and more

00:17:51.833 --> 00:17:53.050
like this and finally-- ooh.

00:17:53.050 --> 00:17:55.166
Finally, it just
becomes like this.

00:17:55.166 --> 00:17:58.250
These became known
as Prairie Houses,

00:17:58.250 --> 00:18:01.316
not just because they were
located on the flat lands

00:18:01.316 --> 00:18:05.100
Midwest but because they
seemed to belong here.

00:18:05.100 --> 00:18:07.900
It's a part of its environment.

00:18:07.900 --> 00:18:12.550
And it graces its environment
rather than disgraces it.

00:18:12.550 --> 00:18:14.916
These daring homes
appealed to clients

00:18:14.916 --> 00:18:17.016
who weren't afraid
to take risks,

00:18:17.016 --> 00:18:19.600
like Frederick and Laura Robie.

00:18:19.600 --> 00:18:22.200
Frederick was a 28-year-old
bicycle manufacturer

00:18:22.200 --> 00:18:26.400
who had just ventured into the
brave new world of automobile

00:18:26.400 --> 00:18:27.433
supplies.

00:18:27.433 --> 00:18:31.350
He was the quintessential
young rebellious guy.

00:18:31.350 --> 00:18:35.933
He designs a car that's part
car and part motorcycle.

00:18:35.933 --> 00:18:38.833
Wright shared Robie's
passion for the automobile.

00:18:38.833 --> 00:18:42.983
The result, he included an
attached three-car garage

00:18:42.983 --> 00:18:45.083
in 1910.

00:18:45.083 --> 00:18:48.883
You're coming out of the age
of the stable and the horses.

00:18:48.883 --> 00:18:50.433
Not for this house.

00:18:50.433 --> 00:18:52.966
This Prairie House wasn't
built on the prairie,

00:18:52.966 --> 00:18:56.200
but in the city, right next
to the University of Chicago.

00:18:56.200 --> 00:18:59.150
So Robie said he was
concerned about privacy.

00:18:59.150 --> 00:19:02.866
Robie wanted a building
where he could see out,

00:19:02.866 --> 00:19:04.883
but people couldn't see in.

00:19:04.883 --> 00:19:09.516
And he had a house with a lot
of glass, but just take a look.

00:19:09.516 --> 00:19:12.100
Wright hid the inside
with art glass windows

00:19:12.100 --> 00:19:13.600
and a projecting balcony.

00:19:13.600 --> 00:19:15.033
Can you see in?

00:19:15.033 --> 00:19:15.533
No.

00:19:15.533 --> 00:19:16.016
Take a look at the--

00:19:16.016 --> 00:19:16.850
Not really.

00:19:16.850 --> 00:19:19.066
Today, the house is
open to the public,

00:19:19.066 --> 00:19:21.466
if you can dins the door.

00:19:21.466 --> 00:19:24.050
Wright recessed the entrance.

00:19:24.050 --> 00:19:26.766
Then you come into a
dark, confined reception

00:19:26.766 --> 00:19:30.500
area, which leads to
a narrow stairway.

00:19:30.500 --> 00:19:32.466
But as you go up
the stairs, you turn

00:19:32.466 --> 00:19:36.500
and ascend toward the
light, eventually emerging

00:19:36.500 --> 00:19:39.800
into a spectacular bright space.

00:19:39.800 --> 00:19:43.283
So what is the point of this
whole journey, this procession

00:19:43.283 --> 00:19:45.833
that Frank Lloyd Wright
has just taken us on?

00:19:45.833 --> 00:19:48.600
Well, it's a thing called drama.

00:19:48.600 --> 00:19:51.616
Going through a Wright building
is playing with your senses,

00:19:51.616 --> 00:19:53.900
it's playing with your emotions.

00:19:53.900 --> 00:19:56.216
As you move through
the house, one room

00:19:56.216 --> 00:19:59.700
flows seamlessly into the
next, uninterrupted by walls

00:19:59.700 --> 00:20:01.000
or doors.

00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:04.300
You're in one continuous space.

00:20:04.300 --> 00:20:07.983
This revolutionary
open plan is completely

00:20:07.983 --> 00:20:10.750
different from the typical
house of the time, which

00:20:10.750 --> 00:20:14.400
was divided into
`discreet`, box-like rooms.

00:20:14.400 --> 00:20:16.950
It's literally breaking the box.

00:20:16.950 --> 00:20:20.300
And where old-fashioned
houses had small windows

00:20:20.300 --> 00:20:22.883
punched into the walls
and covered with drapes,

00:20:22.883 --> 00:20:27.950
the Robie House had continuous
bands of art glass windows.

00:20:27.950 --> 00:20:30.250
The light surrounds you.

00:20:30.250 --> 00:20:32.383
The exterior surrounds you.

00:20:32.383 --> 00:20:35.383
And yet, despite all the
modern features of this house,

00:20:35.383 --> 00:20:38.050
Frank Lloyd Wright also
gave the Robie family

00:20:38.050 --> 00:20:40.933
a very traditional
gathering place.

00:20:40.933 --> 00:20:43.950
And he builds fireplaces
for the rest of his career

00:20:43.950 --> 00:20:49.000
because he's not trying to
destroy domesticity or comfort.

00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:53.133
He sincerely wanted these
to be places for families.

00:20:53.133 --> 00:20:57.016
But even as he was promoting
traditional family values,

00:20:57.016 --> 00:20:59.450
Frank Lloyd Wright was
involved in an affair

00:20:59.450 --> 00:21:01.666
with the wife of a client.

00:21:01.666 --> 00:21:04.233
While the Robie House was
still under construction,

00:21:04.233 --> 00:21:06.766
Wright and his mistress
left their families

00:21:06.766 --> 00:21:08.216
and fled to Europe.

00:21:08.216 --> 00:21:12.000
Which made huge
headlines in the paper.

00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:15.816
The Robie House wasn't good
for Robie's marriage either.

00:21:15.816 --> 00:21:20.283
A year after moving in, Laura
and the two kids moved out.

00:21:20.283 --> 00:21:22.450
The house was put up for sale.

00:21:22.450 --> 00:21:27.616
Robie, his great dream house,
he wasn't here barely a year.

00:21:27.616 --> 00:21:30.383
But Frank Lloyd Wright would
return to the Robie House

00:21:30.383 --> 00:21:34.000
when it was threatened
with demolition in 1957.

00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:36.033
The 89 year old
architect had gone on

00:21:36.033 --> 00:21:39.516
to design some of America's
most famous buildings,

00:21:39.516 --> 00:21:43.433
but he felt compelled to defend
this earlier work, which he not

00:21:43.433 --> 00:21:48.200
sold humbly called a cornerstone
of American architecture.

00:21:48.200 --> 00:21:51.750
By then, it was clear just
how influential Frank Lloyd

00:21:51.750 --> 00:21:53.716
Wright's ideas had become.

00:21:53.716 --> 00:21:56.500
Builders had been cranking
out suburban homes that

00:21:56.500 --> 00:21:58.966
took a page from Wright's book.

00:21:58.966 --> 00:22:01.666
What we would call today
the ranch style house.

00:22:01.666 --> 00:22:06.416
Low slung, horizontal,
overhanging eaves,

00:22:06.416 --> 00:22:10.166
low pitched roofs, and windows
gathered together in strips.

00:22:10.166 --> 00:22:11.933
Where had we seen that before?

00:22:11.933 --> 00:22:12.650
I remember.

00:22:12.650 --> 00:22:13.500
Frank Lloyd Wright.

00:22:21.216 --> 00:22:24.250
When Henry Ford told the
architect Albert Kahn

00:22:24.250 --> 00:22:26.500
that this is what he
wanted him to design,

00:22:26.500 --> 00:22:29.100
Kahn thought he was crazy.

00:22:29.100 --> 00:22:30.716
Kahn was not the
first one to think

00:22:30.716 --> 00:22:32.000
that Henry Ford was crazy.

00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:33.150
[LAUGHTER]

00:22:33.150 --> 00:22:36.233
Kahn couldn't imagine
why anyone needed so much

00:22:36.233 --> 00:22:39.050
uninterrupted space
under one roof.

00:22:39.050 --> 00:22:43.100
But Ford would need it to
introduce his moving assembly

00:22:43.100 --> 00:22:43.600
line.

00:22:43.600 --> 00:22:46.700
Remember, Henry Ford was
a visionary and a dreamer.

00:22:46.700 --> 00:22:49.816
And he saw things
that no one else saw.

00:22:49.816 --> 00:22:52.850
This concrete framed
factory was light years

00:22:52.850 --> 00:22:56.000
ahead of Ford's previous plant.

00:22:56.000 --> 00:22:57.750
The Piquette Plant was
typical of the time

00:22:57.750 --> 00:23:01.083
with it's thick brick
wall and narrow windows.

00:23:01.083 --> 00:23:06.016
It was dimly lit and the space
was broken up by timber posts.

00:23:06.016 --> 00:23:09.033
Henry Ford was using this
old-fashioned factory

00:23:09.033 --> 00:23:12.116
to build a very modern product.

00:23:12.116 --> 00:23:15.166
His Model T had a
user-friendly design

00:23:15.166 --> 00:23:18.800
that allowed just about anyone
to drive and maintain it.

00:23:18.800 --> 00:23:21.333
So he just couldn't make
them fast enough, right?

00:23:21.333 --> 00:23:22.016
Exactly.

00:23:22.016 --> 00:23:25.250
He had to get out of there
into larger quarters.

00:23:25.250 --> 00:23:27.766
Albert Kahn was the
perfect architect

00:23:27.766 --> 00:23:30.416
to design a factory
for Henry Ford.

00:23:30.416 --> 00:23:33.383
Kahn, after all, was the guy
behind the earlier Packard

00:23:33.383 --> 00:23:35.716
Building Number 10.

00:23:35.716 --> 00:23:39.550
Today it's abandoned, but
when it was built in 1905,

00:23:39.550 --> 00:23:43.200
this was one of the first
so-called daylight factories.

00:23:43.200 --> 00:23:46.400
They had huge windows
and wide open floor plans

00:23:46.400 --> 00:23:49.733
thanks to their reinforced
concrete frames.

00:23:49.733 --> 00:23:54.216
Kahn made it possible for the
kind of vast open space that

00:23:54.216 --> 00:23:56.150
is flooded with light.

00:23:56.150 --> 00:23:59.283
This is what Henry Ford
wanted, but he and Albert Kahn

00:23:59.283 --> 00:24:01.666
would make an unlikely pair.

00:24:01.666 --> 00:24:04.200
Kahn was Jewish,
the son of a rabbi.

00:24:04.200 --> 00:24:07.966
Ford famously published
The International Jew,

00:24:07.966 --> 00:24:11.916
which suggested that Jews were
plotting to control the world.

00:24:11.916 --> 00:24:13.700
Do you know if Kahn
ever brought it up?

00:24:13.700 --> 00:24:16.700
Kahn never brought up the issue.

00:24:16.700 --> 00:24:19.816
He really said by implication
it wouldn't do any good

00:24:19.816 --> 00:24:22.650
and all it would do would
be to damage my business

00:24:22.650 --> 00:24:24.550
relation with him.

00:24:24.550 --> 00:24:26.816
Despite their
differences, Kahn and Ford

00:24:26.816 --> 00:24:30.900
teamed up to change the face of
American industry just outside

00:24:30.900 --> 00:24:32.600
of Detroit.

00:24:32.600 --> 00:24:35.366
Highland Park's
broad walls of glass

00:24:35.366 --> 00:24:37.783
supplied plenty of
light and fresh air

00:24:37.783 --> 00:24:40.450
to the factory floor,
which was good for workers

00:24:40.450 --> 00:24:42.450
and Ford's bottom line.

00:24:42.450 --> 00:24:44.566
It improved workers' comfort.

00:24:44.566 --> 00:24:46.016
And therefore
productivity, right?

00:24:46.016 --> 00:24:46.866
And therefore productivity.

00:24:46.866 --> 00:24:47.483
[LAUGHTER]

00:24:47.483 --> 00:24:48.116
Yes.

00:24:48.116 --> 00:24:50.450
The sheer enormity
of the complex

00:24:50.450 --> 00:24:52.850
not only allowed Ford to
make most of the Model T

00:24:52.850 --> 00:24:55.566
in one place, it
also gave the company

00:24:55.566 --> 00:25:00.200
the space to experiment with
a new way of building cars.

00:25:00.200 --> 00:25:02.566
Before the assembly
line, each Model T

00:25:02.566 --> 00:25:05.066
had been put together
on wooden saw horses

00:25:05.066 --> 00:25:08.916
by teams of assemblers who all
moved from one car to the next

00:25:08.916 --> 00:25:12.566
and all the parts had to
be dragged to each car

00:25:12.566 --> 00:25:15.950
by workers known as
pushers and shovers.

00:25:15.950 --> 00:25:18.116
Who would spend a
lot of time going

00:25:18.116 --> 00:25:21.066
to other parts of the factory
to bring parts for the one car

00:25:21.066 --> 00:25:21.950
they were working on.

00:25:21.950 --> 00:25:22.450
Ah.

00:25:22.450 --> 00:25:26.100
But the vast, uninterrupted
spaces of Highland Park

00:25:26.100 --> 00:25:29.716
made it possible to move
the car through the plant

00:25:29.716 --> 00:25:32.366
and to a long line
of workers, each

00:25:32.366 --> 00:25:34.900
with a single part
and a simple task

00:25:34.900 --> 00:25:37.466
to perform over and over again.

00:25:37.466 --> 00:25:41.650
It saved enormous amount of
wasted motions and it brought

00:25:41.650 --> 00:25:45.766
an enormous reduction in the
cost of making Model T's.

00:25:45.766 --> 00:25:48.683
But Henry Ford still
wasn't satisfied.

00:25:48.683 --> 00:25:52.850
He felt that the four and six
story spaces at Highland Park

00:25:52.850 --> 00:25:56.133
wasted time and energy
moving parts up and down.

00:25:56.133 --> 00:26:00.616
So remarkably, just five years
after opening Highland Park,

00:26:00.616 --> 00:26:04.266
Ford asked Albert Kahn
to design an entirely new

00:26:04.266 --> 00:26:06.200
single-story plant.

00:26:06.200 --> 00:26:10.016
Henry Ford was not `bashful`
about dropping something

00:26:10.016 --> 00:26:12.566
he thought was outdated
and moving ahead

00:26:12.566 --> 00:26:14.100
with something new.

00:26:14.100 --> 00:26:17.183
Over the next 30 years,
as Henry Ford constantly

00:26:17.183 --> 00:26:20.666
improved his production process,
he would call on Albert Kahn

00:26:20.666 --> 00:26:24.333
to design more than
1,000 factory buildings.

00:26:24.333 --> 00:26:26.666
And like Highland Park
and every American factory

00:26:26.666 --> 00:26:28.800
that came after
it, these buildings

00:26:28.800 --> 00:26:33.000
would have wide open spaces
that were filled with light.

00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:36.216
Ford and Kahn were very
much an unlikely duo.

00:26:36.216 --> 00:26:41.533
And yet Kahn's plan
for the Ford plant

00:26:41.533 --> 00:26:46.666
set the pattern for American
industrial architecture

00:26:46.666 --> 00:26:47.916
of the 20th century.

00:26:55.900 --> 00:26:57.966
You may not know his
name, but you definitely

00:26:57.966 --> 00:27:00.016
know his creation.

00:27:00.016 --> 00:27:04.200
Victor Gruen designed the
first modern indoor mall.

00:27:04.200 --> 00:27:08.100
Victor Gruen considered
this a Utopian experiment.

00:27:08.100 --> 00:27:10.900
That's because the architect
of Southdale Center

00:27:10.900 --> 00:27:15.366
was a Socialist, and this was
his new vision for suburbia.

00:27:15.366 --> 00:27:17.383
He wanted to get people
out of their cars.

00:27:17.383 --> 00:27:18.933
He was worried
that everyone would

00:27:18.933 --> 00:27:21.116
go from their private
house, their private car,

00:27:21.116 --> 00:27:23.400
to their private office
and back and never get

00:27:23.400 --> 00:27:26.316
to know their neighbors,
never have any interaction.

00:27:26.316 --> 00:27:28.166
So that was the
idea of the mall.

00:27:28.166 --> 00:27:30.783
The vibrant community
Victor Gruen

00:27:30.783 --> 00:27:33.066
created in this
Minnesota mall was

00:27:33.066 --> 00:27:36.566
inspired by the bustling
street life Vienna, Austria,

00:27:36.566 --> 00:27:38.216
where he grew up.

00:27:38.216 --> 00:27:40.816
He had studied architecture
at the Vienna Academy

00:27:40.816 --> 00:27:44.500
of Fine Arts, the same school
that had rejected an inspiring

00:27:44.500 --> 00:27:48.166
artist named Adolf
Hitler 10 years earlier.

00:27:48.166 --> 00:27:50.583
When Hitler's interests
turned more sinister,

00:27:50.583 --> 00:27:53.916
Victor Gruen, who was
Jewish, fled to America.

00:27:53.916 --> 00:27:57.950
It is a new concept fitting
to a particular situation.

00:27:57.950 --> 00:27:59.833
Gruen soon made a
name for himself

00:27:59.833 --> 00:28:02.916
in New York designing
spectacular storefronts

00:28:02.916 --> 00:28:04.450
across the city.

00:28:04.450 --> 00:28:07.900
But he recognized the retail
action in post-war America

00:28:07.900 --> 00:28:09.466
was shifting to the suburbs.

00:28:09.466 --> 00:28:12.516
And he didn't like he saw.

00:28:12.516 --> 00:28:16.166
Victor Gruen was dismayed by
the unsightly commercial strips

00:28:16.166 --> 00:28:20.000
sprawling for miles on end,
what he called the greatest

00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:24.200
collection of vulgarity
ever collected by mankind.

00:28:24.200 --> 00:28:26.683
So he thought, if
we don't intervene,

00:28:26.683 --> 00:28:30.166
we're just going to have
large tracts of development

00:28:30.166 --> 00:28:31.716
with no center.

00:28:31.716 --> 00:28:36.050
Gruen got a chance to
remake suburbia in 1952 when

00:28:36.050 --> 00:28:39.583
the Dayton Company hired him
to design an indoor shopping

00:28:39.583 --> 00:28:41.916
mall in a Minneapolis suburb.

00:28:41.916 --> 00:28:45.050
While a small neighborhood
mall had been enclosed before,

00:28:45.050 --> 00:28:47.783
Southdale is where
Victor Gruen introduced

00:28:47.783 --> 00:28:50.483
the formula for the
regional indoor shopping

00:28:50.483 --> 00:28:54.833
mall, a formula that has Gruen's
idealistic vision written

00:28:54.833 --> 00:28:55.916
all over it.

00:28:55.916 --> 00:28:58.250
Look at this big,
blank wall here.

00:28:58.250 --> 00:28:59.683
What's the purpose of that?

00:28:59.683 --> 00:29:02.366
Well, Victor Gruen called
this the introverted type.

00:29:02.366 --> 00:29:04.383
And what he really
wanted to do was

00:29:04.383 --> 00:29:07.550
to take the typical suburban
shopping center, which

00:29:07.550 --> 00:29:10.833
faced out to the
street, and flip that.

00:29:10.833 --> 00:29:13.883
This way, Gruen could take
all that sprawling commercial

00:29:13.883 --> 00:29:17.666
clutter he hated and hide
it in a central facility

00:29:17.666 --> 00:29:19.566
with a plain exterior.

00:29:19.566 --> 00:29:23.550
So that the stores faced inward
into an air conditioned space.

00:29:23.550 --> 00:29:26.566
Inside, it was a
shopper's paradise.

00:29:26.566 --> 00:29:29.583
72 stores under one roof.

00:29:29.583 --> 00:29:32.550
But this wasn't just
a place to buy things.

00:29:32.550 --> 00:29:36.700
At its center was the Garden
Court of Perpetual Spring,

00:29:36.700 --> 00:29:40.183
which featured a goldfish
pond and an aviary, sculptures

00:29:40.183 --> 00:29:42.233
and a sidewalk cafe.

00:29:42.233 --> 00:29:45.250
There was even a small
zoo in the basement.

00:29:45.250 --> 00:29:48.466
At Southdale suburbanites,
could get out of their cars

00:29:48.466 --> 00:29:51.200
and enjoy all the
benefits of a downtown

00:29:51.200 --> 00:29:53.783
without all the
traffic and dirt.

00:29:53.783 --> 00:29:57.700
So he really envisioned
malls as community centers

00:29:57.700 --> 00:30:01.266
rather than as places that
you simply go to shop.

00:30:01.266 --> 00:30:04.616
This urban-like setting
was also good for business.

00:30:04.616 --> 00:30:07.683
The experience was
so dazzling and fun,

00:30:07.683 --> 00:30:11.416
customers stayed longer
and shopped more.

00:30:11.416 --> 00:30:13.716
The windows were
placed high above

00:30:13.716 --> 00:30:15.550
so shoppers wouldn't
be distracted

00:30:15.550 --> 00:30:18.016
by what was going on
in the outside world.

00:30:18.016 --> 00:30:19.400
A little bit like a casino.

00:30:19.400 --> 00:30:23.066
They didn't want people
to actually look outside.

00:30:23.066 --> 00:30:28.366
The Socialist architect had
created a Capitalist cash cow.

00:30:28.366 --> 00:30:32.416
On the day Southdale opened,
75,000 curiosity seekers

00:30:32.416 --> 00:30:35.166
came out to see what
Life Magazine dubbed

00:30:35.166 --> 00:30:38.816
the splashiest
shopping center in US.

00:30:38.816 --> 00:30:41.250
Though it did have at
least one detractor,

00:30:41.250 --> 00:30:43.633
Frank Lloyd Wright
came for a tour

00:30:43.633 --> 00:30:46.966
and said the Garden Court had
all the evils of the village

00:30:46.966 --> 00:30:49.550
street and none of its charm.

00:30:49.550 --> 00:30:51.700
You've tried to bring
downtown out here.

00:30:51.700 --> 00:30:54.833
You should have left
downtown downtown.

00:30:54.833 --> 00:30:57.233
Over time, Victor
Gruen himself grew

00:30:57.233 --> 00:31:00.033
disillusioned with
his grand experiment.

00:31:00.033 --> 00:31:02.983
You see, he had envisioned
the shopping center as just

00:31:02.983 --> 00:31:06.000
one piece of a larger
planned community,

00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:09.550
which was supposed to include
houses, apartments, offices,

00:31:09.550 --> 00:31:11.116
and schools.

00:31:11.116 --> 00:31:13.883
Gruen hoped this would be
a compact and well-ordered

00:31:13.883 --> 00:31:16.650
alternative to
sprawl and blight.

00:31:16.650 --> 00:31:19.000
Now that all didn't
come to pass.

00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:21.816
And so, in many ways
the most important part

00:31:21.816 --> 00:31:24.850
of Gruen's vision
hasn't been realized.

00:31:24.850 --> 00:31:27.633
Instead, Southdale
became an isolated island

00:31:27.633 --> 00:31:30.550
of retail in a sea of parking.

00:31:30.550 --> 00:31:33.100
And this is what large
swaths of suburban America

00:31:33.100 --> 00:31:34.350
came to look like.

00:31:34.350 --> 00:31:37.566
Southdale was
imitated far and wide.

00:31:37.566 --> 00:31:41.900
Gruen called these copycat
malls bastard developments.

00:31:41.900 --> 00:31:44.266
They lacked his
larger social vision

00:31:44.266 --> 00:31:47.066
and instead attracted
more of the sprawl

00:31:47.066 --> 00:31:50.216
he tried so
desperately to fight.

00:31:50.216 --> 00:31:53.816
And I think that that's the--
kind of the tragedy of it.

00:31:53.816 --> 00:31:59.200
We didn't understand the depth
and breadth of his vision.

00:32:05.950 --> 00:32:09.216
It's been so widely
imitated that today it

00:32:09.216 --> 00:32:11.250
almost looks ordinary.

00:32:11.250 --> 00:32:14.350
This building is not
like all those knockoffs.

00:32:14.350 --> 00:32:19.766
In 1958, this sleek glass
skyscraper was groundbreaking.

00:32:19.766 --> 00:32:24.216
When it went up, the
entire world noticed.

00:32:24.216 --> 00:32:26.333
It was built by the
Seagram Corporation

00:32:26.333 --> 00:32:28.483
as its US headquarters.

00:32:28.483 --> 00:32:31.866
The corporate giant ended up
with an avant garde building

00:32:31.866 --> 00:32:35.766
because it let a young art
student choose the architect.

00:32:35.766 --> 00:32:37.700
To me it wasn't a
corporate headquarters.

00:32:37.700 --> 00:32:40.616
It was a skyscraper in New York.

00:32:40.616 --> 00:32:42.833
Phyllis Lambert was
just 27 when she

00:32:42.833 --> 00:32:45.600
learned that her father, Seagram
president Samuel Bronfman,

00:32:45.600 --> 00:32:49.366
would build his headquarters
on New York's posh Park Avenue.

00:32:49.366 --> 00:32:51.866
I wouldn't have known anything
about corporate headquarters,

00:32:51.866 --> 00:32:53.250
I can assure you that.

00:32:53.250 --> 00:32:55.666
But she did know
about architecture,

00:32:55.666 --> 00:32:57.800
and when Lambert saw
the original design

00:32:57.800 --> 00:33:00.400
for the building,
she was appalled.

00:33:00.400 --> 00:33:02.966
To this day, it's hard
for her to even look

00:33:02.966 --> 00:33:05.300
at a picture of it.

00:33:05.300 --> 00:33:06.083
Ew.

00:33:06.083 --> 00:33:07.950
It is so upsetting
to even look at it.

00:33:07.950 --> 00:33:10.966
My stomach sort of
goes-- I wrote my father

00:33:10.966 --> 00:33:13.200
a long, long letter.

00:33:13.200 --> 00:33:19.200
And the letter starts
off, no, no, no.

00:33:19.200 --> 00:33:21.750
While the original design
would have looked right at home

00:33:21.750 --> 00:33:23.783
in pre-war America--

00:33:23.783 --> 00:33:24.350
No.

00:33:24.350 --> 00:33:28.450
--Phyllis Lambert knew
we had entered a new age.

00:33:28.450 --> 00:33:30.500
Architects were
building skyscrapers

00:33:30.500 --> 00:33:33.700
without all the brick
and stone and decorations

00:33:33.700 --> 00:33:36.233
that had covered steel
frame buildings since Louis

00:33:36.233 --> 00:33:37.783
Sullivan's time.

00:33:37.783 --> 00:33:40.433
Instead, they were
letting naked steel

00:33:40.433 --> 00:33:44.050
and transparent glass
speak for themselves.

00:33:44.050 --> 00:33:46.116
If you're going to
build a building,

00:33:46.116 --> 00:33:49.066
then you do the best building
as you can at the time.

00:33:49.066 --> 00:33:51.783
You do the best of
your civilization.

00:33:51.783 --> 00:33:55.150
Samuel Bronfman was convinced
his daughter would choose

00:33:55.150 --> 00:33:57.900
the right architect
for this new age.

00:33:57.900 --> 00:34:00.800
So Lambert set out
across the country,

00:34:00.800 --> 00:34:03.850
meeting some of the great
designers of the day.

00:34:03.850 --> 00:34:06.200
She says that most of
them compared themselves

00:34:06.200 --> 00:34:09.666
to the German-born
architect Mies van der Rohe.

00:34:09.666 --> 00:34:13.183
And when she met the man
himself, she understood why.

00:34:13.183 --> 00:34:16.250
He was so much more generous
than all the other people.

00:34:16.250 --> 00:34:18.916
There was a kind of
presence about that man.

00:34:18.916 --> 00:34:21.800
But what ultimately
sold her was Mies' work.

00:34:21.800 --> 00:34:23.916
He had envisioned
glass skyscrapers

00:34:23.916 --> 00:34:27.666
all the way back in the
early 1920s in Germany.

00:34:27.666 --> 00:34:31.816
Mies was part of a generation of
European modernistic architects

00:34:31.816 --> 00:34:35.116
who used the latest
technology to confront the war

00:34:35.116 --> 00:34:37.766
and inequity that had
plagued the continent.

00:34:37.766 --> 00:34:41.283
They came out of World
War I. And they understood

00:34:41.283 --> 00:34:45.750
what caused World War I, this
intense insane nationalism.

00:34:45.750 --> 00:34:48.916
And Mies van der
Rohe and his gang

00:34:48.916 --> 00:34:53.183
wanted to create a new
international architectural

00:34:53.183 --> 00:34:54.400
language.

00:34:54.400 --> 00:34:58.450
This international style became
popular with corporate America

00:34:58.450 --> 00:35:00.700
for less idealistic reasons.

00:35:00.700 --> 00:35:03.550
It made a company look
cutting edge and efficiency,

00:35:03.550 --> 00:35:05.583
plus it could be cheap.

00:35:05.583 --> 00:35:08.183
It was very inexpensive
to build that way.

00:35:08.183 --> 00:35:10.066
It's repetitive form.

00:35:10.066 --> 00:35:13.216
But when Mies van der Rohe
met with Samuel Bronfman,

00:35:13.216 --> 00:35:16.066
he quickly learned that
saving money was not

00:35:16.066 --> 00:35:18.383
on the agenda for
the Seagram Building.

00:35:18.383 --> 00:35:22.000
Mies said to my father, what
kind of materials do you like?

00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:24.550
And my father said
he liked bronze.

00:35:24.550 --> 00:35:28.950
So Mies covered the
entire building in bronze.

00:35:28.950 --> 00:35:32.450
And because he used
bronze, he could

00:35:32.450 --> 00:35:35.766
create a finesse of details.

00:35:35.766 --> 00:35:39.100
Mies said God is in
the details, and it's

00:35:39.100 --> 00:35:41.700
the details that set
this building apart,

00:35:41.700 --> 00:35:44.566
some designed by
architect Philip Johnson.

00:35:44.566 --> 00:35:48.600
The materials include pale
travertine, pink granite,

00:35:48.600 --> 00:35:50.883
and Verd Antique marble.

00:35:50.883 --> 00:35:55.583
This building is so
subtle and yet so complex.

00:35:55.583 --> 00:35:57.700
At first glance, it
might seem as if you're

00:35:57.700 --> 00:35:59.883
seeing the bare bones
of the building,

00:35:59.883 --> 00:36:02.050
but this is actually
an illusion.

00:36:02.050 --> 00:36:04.766
Mies placed I beams on
the outside of building,

00:36:04.766 --> 00:36:06.550
which serve little function.

00:36:06.550 --> 00:36:08.266
It's a decorative facade.

00:36:08.266 --> 00:36:11.000
And the actual structure,
the steel framing,

00:36:11.000 --> 00:36:13.000
is tucked behind it.

00:36:13.000 --> 00:36:13.616
I see them.

00:36:13.616 --> 00:36:17.000
They're columns behind
the glass windows.

00:36:17.000 --> 00:36:19.916
But the most striking
and expensive feature

00:36:19.916 --> 00:36:24.400
of this building is the huge
empty space in front of it.

00:36:24.400 --> 00:36:27.000
This was Mies'
surprising solution

00:36:27.000 --> 00:36:30.033
New York's strict zoning
code, which had long

00:36:30.033 --> 00:36:33.250
prevented skyscrapers from
rising like sheer cliffs that

00:36:33.250 --> 00:36:36.200
block out the city's
light and air.

00:36:36.200 --> 00:36:38.716
Other architects had
responded to these rules

00:36:38.716 --> 00:36:41.300
with setback skyscrapers,
which gradually

00:36:41.300 --> 00:36:43.150
receded from the street.

00:36:43.150 --> 00:36:45.083
Well, Mies van der
Rohe didn't want

00:36:45.083 --> 00:36:47.216
to design a setback building.

00:36:47.216 --> 00:36:51.100
Instead, he left a pricey
piece of New York real estate

00:36:51.100 --> 00:36:54.066
open as a kind of
gift to the city.

00:36:54.066 --> 00:36:55.616
That really shocked New York.

00:36:55.616 --> 00:36:57.416
You know how you
shock New Yorkers?

00:36:57.416 --> 00:36:58.766
It's not with vulgarisms.

00:36:58.766 --> 00:36:59.800
Just be polite to them.

00:36:59.800 --> 00:37:00.516
[LAUGHTER]

00:37:00.516 --> 00:37:01.916
And they don't get it.

00:37:01.916 --> 00:37:04.133
But architects and
developers clearly

00:37:04.133 --> 00:37:06.366
did get it because
the nation soon

00:37:06.366 --> 00:37:11.200
saw a proliferation of modernist
buildings set on broad plazas.

00:37:11.200 --> 00:37:13.266
Everyone said, oh,
that's so nice.

00:37:13.266 --> 00:37:14.766
The Seagram Building
has that plaza.

00:37:14.766 --> 00:37:15.833
Everyone loves it.

00:37:15.833 --> 00:37:17.583
Let's have plazas everywhere.

00:37:17.583 --> 00:37:19.450
And, gee, funny thing.

00:37:19.450 --> 00:37:21.050
None of them were as good.

00:37:21.050 --> 00:37:23.550
And in fact, a lot of
them were really horrible.

00:37:23.550 --> 00:37:28.250
They were awful, ugly,
concrete prison yards.

00:37:28.250 --> 00:37:31.300
And the skyscrapers
themselves could never quite

00:37:31.300 --> 00:37:34.500
recreate the magic of
the Seagram Building.

00:37:34.500 --> 00:37:36.716
It looks easy to copy.

00:37:36.716 --> 00:37:39.316
I can just do one
floor and stack them up

00:37:39.316 --> 00:37:41.650
and every single one of them
is the same from there on.

00:37:41.650 --> 00:37:43.133
How hard can this be?

00:37:43.133 --> 00:37:46.816
Well, how hard is it to get
your proportions correct?

00:37:46.816 --> 00:37:50.050
How hard it is to choose
the right materials?

00:37:50.050 --> 00:37:53.033
How hard is it to make
the proper relationship

00:37:53.033 --> 00:37:55.300
between a building and its site?

00:37:55.300 --> 00:37:58.416
You're damn right that's
a tough building to make.

00:37:58.416 --> 00:38:00.183
We are visiting
10 buildings that

00:38:00.183 --> 00:38:02.983
changed America in
chronological order,

00:38:02.983 --> 00:38:05.016
and we've arrived
at our eighth stop.

00:38:11.816 --> 00:38:15.150
Today it's almost
hard to believe,

00:38:15.150 --> 00:38:17.783
but there was a time
when getting on a plane

00:38:17.783 --> 00:38:21.100
was a joyful experience.

00:38:21.100 --> 00:38:25.000
And few airports captured
the magic of early jet travel

00:38:25.000 --> 00:38:26.833
like this one.

00:38:26.833 --> 00:38:30.150
In the 1960s, air travel was
still a very special thing.

00:38:30.150 --> 00:38:32.166
Suddenly people
could fly nonstop

00:38:32.166 --> 00:38:35.150
across the ocean, all
these glamorous spots.

00:38:35.150 --> 00:38:36.700
And Eero Saarinen,
the architect,

00:38:36.700 --> 00:38:40.666
successfully captures that sense
of excitement and anticipation.

00:38:40.666 --> 00:38:43.200
Dulles has all the
sculptural stylishness

00:38:43.200 --> 00:38:45.950
Eero Saarinen was known for.

00:38:45.950 --> 00:38:49.700
In an era often remembered for
its understated glass boxes,

00:38:49.700 --> 00:38:54.100
Saarinen offered a more
expressive brand of modernism.

00:38:54.100 --> 00:38:56.716
He understood the
kind of spectacle

00:38:56.716 --> 00:39:00.116
that architecture could
be and the theatricality

00:39:00.116 --> 00:39:03.750
that was suppressed in
the more rational avant

00:39:03.750 --> 00:39:05.716
garde modern architecture.

00:39:05.716 --> 00:39:07.666
Saarinen was
finishing his design

00:39:07.666 --> 00:39:11.366
for a new TWA Terminal in
New York when he got the call

00:39:11.366 --> 00:39:14.566
to design Dulles
outside Washington, DC.

00:39:14.566 --> 00:39:16.616
But this wasn't
just any airport.

00:39:16.616 --> 00:39:18.716
Dulles would be
the first airport

00:39:18.716 --> 00:39:22.516
in the world built
expressly for jets.

00:39:22.516 --> 00:39:25.533
Saarinen said, this is a
different kind of transit.

00:39:25.533 --> 00:39:29.650
We are transporting ourselves
in a new machine and a new era

00:39:29.650 --> 00:39:31.450
and we have to represent that.

00:39:31.450 --> 00:39:35.550
Saarinen decided to take a
highly scientific approach.

00:39:35.550 --> 00:39:38.083
He started by sending
teams of researchers

00:39:38.083 --> 00:39:41.700
out to American airports,
armed with stopwatches.

00:39:41.700 --> 00:39:43.966
How fast do people move
from point A to point B?

00:39:43.966 --> 00:39:46.450
What are their patterns of
transit within a building?

00:39:46.450 --> 00:39:48.400
Why are they going from A to B?

00:39:48.400 --> 00:39:50.066
Saarinen found that
people had to do

00:39:50.066 --> 00:39:52.833
a lot of walking to
get to their planes.

00:39:52.833 --> 00:39:55.100
That's because these
airports had originally

00:39:55.100 --> 00:39:59.100
been designed to serve smaller
propeller-driven planes,

00:39:59.100 --> 00:40:02.950
and now they were adapting to
the oversized needs of jets

00:40:02.950 --> 00:40:06.966
by cobbling together an endless
expanse of terminal fingers,

00:40:06.966 --> 00:40:11.450
lounges, and new
telescoping gang planks.

00:40:11.450 --> 00:40:13.433
Saarinen was really
eager to try to avoid

00:40:13.433 --> 00:40:15.400
those fingers, those
tentacles, coming out

00:40:15.400 --> 00:40:16.983
of airport terminals
that were already

00:40:16.983 --> 00:40:19.083
starting to create such a mess.

00:40:19.083 --> 00:40:23.166
So at Dulles, Saarinen designed
a single narrow terminal

00:40:23.166 --> 00:40:26.716
where passengers only
had to walk 150 feet.

00:40:26.716 --> 00:40:30.683
Then, a contraption called
mobile lounge would whisk them

00:40:30.683 --> 00:40:32.150
away to their plane.

00:40:32.150 --> 00:40:35.500
So 150 feet, and then
you were ready to relax

00:40:35.500 --> 00:40:37.633
and get ready to travel.

00:40:37.633 --> 00:40:40.216
A half century later,
some of the mobile lounges

00:40:40.216 --> 00:40:42.166
are still in use.

00:40:42.166 --> 00:40:45.716
These were designed to
work like actual lounges.

00:40:45.716 --> 00:40:48.516
You could relax in here
with a cigarette and a drink

00:40:48.516 --> 00:40:51.916
while the lounge took
you to your plane.

00:40:51.916 --> 00:40:55.166
Saarinen wanted this to look
like a 20th century gateway

00:40:55.166 --> 00:40:59.083
to the nation's capital, so
he combined the curviness

00:40:59.083 --> 00:41:02.900
of the jet age with the
classicism of Washington, DC.

00:41:02.900 --> 00:41:05.666
I think it's easy to see this
front part of the building

00:41:05.666 --> 00:41:08.633
as an abstraction of
a classical temple.

00:41:08.633 --> 00:41:09.450
With the columns.

00:41:09.450 --> 00:41:10.816
With the columns, the colonnade.

00:41:10.816 --> 00:41:13.550
Sort of in keeping with
the official architecture

00:41:13.550 --> 00:41:15.083
of Washington, DC.

00:41:15.083 --> 00:41:18.533
The columns hold up the
swooping concrete roof

00:41:18.533 --> 00:41:21.883
in a way the ancient Greeks
never could have imagined.

00:41:21.883 --> 00:41:24.233
Instead of resting
on top of them,

00:41:24.233 --> 00:41:28.333
the roof hangs from them
like a giant hammock.

00:41:28.333 --> 00:41:31.766
The solid concrete appears
to float above the undulating

00:41:31.766 --> 00:41:33.100
glass walls.

00:41:33.100 --> 00:41:35.350
It doesn't look like anything
you've ever seen before.

00:41:35.350 --> 00:41:39.100
You don't know what
makes it stand up.

00:41:39.100 --> 00:41:40.866
It's a big concrete
building that

00:41:40.866 --> 00:41:43.416
looks as light as a
handkerchief in the wind.

00:41:43.416 --> 00:41:46.366
It looks like it's going to
just blow away at any minute.

00:41:46.366 --> 00:41:47.916
It won't hurt you
when that happens.

00:41:47.916 --> 00:41:50.816
It'll just kind of float off
and land in some other airport

00:41:50.816 --> 00:41:52.200
somewhere else.

00:41:52.200 --> 00:41:55.550
Eero Saarinen never got to
see the completed airport.

00:41:55.550 --> 00:41:57.716
He died suddenly
from a brain tumor

00:41:57.716 --> 00:42:00.200
when Dulles was still
under construction.

00:42:00.200 --> 00:42:01.916
But the weightless
form he created

00:42:01.916 --> 00:42:05.750
here left a permanent mark
on the world's architecture.

00:42:05.750 --> 00:42:09.400
Some airport architects seem
to have overtly copied Dulles'

00:42:09.400 --> 00:42:10.900
swooping shapes.

00:42:10.900 --> 00:42:14.316
Others have simply been inspired
by Saarinen's broader vision

00:42:14.316 --> 00:42:18.350
for what an airport should be--
a well ordered and welcoming

00:42:18.350 --> 00:42:20.216
gateway to a city.

00:42:20.216 --> 00:42:23.333
Especially nowadays, when
travel can be so stressful,

00:42:23.333 --> 00:42:25.683
to have a sense that
everything is going to work.

00:42:25.683 --> 00:42:27.933
That you're going to know
where you're supposed to go.

00:42:27.933 --> 00:42:29.533
That it will be a
pleasant experience

00:42:29.533 --> 00:42:30.750
to move through the building.

00:42:30.750 --> 00:42:33.150
All of those things are very
much the architect's job.

00:42:41.116 --> 00:42:44.700
It's been called the
first postmodern building.

00:42:44.700 --> 00:42:48.900
Its architect thumbed his nose
at modernism's strict rules.

00:42:48.900 --> 00:42:49.400
Why?

00:42:49.400 --> 00:42:50.250
What was wrong with them?

00:42:50.250 --> 00:42:50.500
What--

00:42:50.500 --> 00:42:50.916
I don't know.

00:42:50.916 --> 00:42:52.250
Just that I'm kind of a pervert.

00:42:52.250 --> 00:42:54.816
[LAUGHTER]

00:42:54.816 --> 00:42:58.150
Modernist buildings had
entire walls of windows.

00:42:58.150 --> 00:43:01.200
But you never have a
wall with a window in it.

00:43:01.200 --> 00:43:04.366
Modernists frowned upon
frivolous decoration.

00:43:04.366 --> 00:43:08.550
And this house has the kind
of wood elements on it.

00:43:08.550 --> 00:43:10.866
And he heard modern
architect Marcel Breuer

00:43:10.866 --> 00:43:13.683
say you should never
paint a house green.

00:43:13.683 --> 00:43:16.500
And so I immediately
said, I'm going home

00:43:16.500 --> 00:43:18.316
and painting that house green.

00:43:18.316 --> 00:43:22.200
Robert Venturi sparked a big
debate with this little house

00:43:22.200 --> 00:43:23.850
on the edge of
Philadelphia, which

00:43:23.850 --> 00:43:26.066
he designed for
his elderly mother.

00:43:26.066 --> 00:43:28.166
Like her son, Vanna
Venturi wasn't

00:43:28.166 --> 00:43:30.383
afraid to go against the grain.

00:43:30.383 --> 00:43:34.650
She was this combination
of Socialist and pacifist.

00:43:34.650 --> 00:43:36.700
And she refused to send
you to public school.

00:43:36.700 --> 00:43:37.250
That's right.

00:43:37.250 --> 00:43:39.416
Because she was afraid I'd
have to pledge allegiance

00:43:39.416 --> 00:43:40.383
to the flag.

00:43:40.383 --> 00:43:42.933
In other words, she
was an ideal client

00:43:42.933 --> 00:43:46.250
for a house that would challenge
the modernist establishment.

00:43:46.250 --> 00:43:49.616
She just sort of
left it up to me.

00:43:49.616 --> 00:43:52.216
Robert Venturi's
problem with modernists

00:43:52.216 --> 00:43:54.716
was that they tried to
meet the complicated needs

00:43:54.716 --> 00:43:58.800
of our society with grand
schemes and rigid rules.

00:43:58.800 --> 00:44:02.916
The result, he felt, was
bland architecture that people

00:44:02.916 --> 00:44:04.583
had trouble connecting with.

00:44:04.583 --> 00:44:09.083
Mies van der Rohe famously
declared, less is more.

00:44:09.083 --> 00:44:12.700
Venturi shot back,
less is a bore.

00:44:12.700 --> 00:44:16.050
He said, why should we
be reducing architecture

00:44:16.050 --> 00:44:20.116
to this pure simple
minimalist object?

00:44:20.116 --> 00:44:23.450
But Robert Venturi's
manifesto against modernism

00:44:23.450 --> 00:44:25.233
didn't come easily.

00:44:25.233 --> 00:44:29.633
For four years, he designed
and redesigned the house.

00:44:29.633 --> 00:44:32.466
He started designing
it when we met.

00:44:32.466 --> 00:44:34.850
I met him in 1960.

00:44:34.850 --> 00:44:37.116
His future wife and
collaborator found

00:44:37.116 --> 00:44:40.650
he was always disappearing
to work on his mom's house.

00:44:40.650 --> 00:44:42.400
Then every now and
then I wouldn't see him

00:44:42.400 --> 00:44:43.566
for about a month.

00:44:43.566 --> 00:44:44.866
And I thought, look.

00:44:44.866 --> 00:44:47.250
This is a very
interesting person.

00:44:47.250 --> 00:44:51.466
In particular, he labored over
the unusually tall chimney,

00:44:51.466 --> 00:44:54.650
which he says was an
obscene gesture directed

00:44:54.650 --> 00:44:56.116
at the establishment.

00:44:56.116 --> 00:44:58.816
The chimney was
a bit doing this.

00:44:58.816 --> 00:45:01.383
The completed house
looks vaguely familiar,

00:45:01.383 --> 00:45:03.766
even if you've never
seen it before.

00:45:03.766 --> 00:45:07.083
That's because Venturi
borrowed familiar elements that

00:45:07.083 --> 00:45:10.100
have been used by home
builders throughout history.

00:45:10.100 --> 00:45:14.416
Instead of an abstract
modernist box this house--

00:45:14.416 --> 00:45:17.350
Looks like a child's drawing.

00:45:17.350 --> 00:45:19.783
I think that's a
nice thing to say.

00:45:19.783 --> 00:45:20.950
An appropriate thing to say.

00:45:20.950 --> 00:45:23.900
Because I wanted it to be
a kind of fundamental--

00:45:23.900 --> 00:45:24.400
Generic.

00:45:24.400 --> 00:45:27.316
Symbolic, generic house.

00:45:27.316 --> 00:45:28.966
But as you get
closer, you discover

00:45:28.966 --> 00:45:32.000
that what looks like a
huge chimney from afar

00:45:32.000 --> 00:45:36.183
can't possibly be real
because it has windows.

00:45:36.183 --> 00:45:39.383
Through them, you see
stairs, not smoke.

00:45:39.383 --> 00:45:41.816
And what appears
to be a gable roof

00:45:41.816 --> 00:45:44.466
has the real roof
hiding behind it,

00:45:44.466 --> 00:45:46.166
along with the real chimney.

00:45:46.166 --> 00:45:48.566
So what you're saying is this
is really a facade, right?

00:45:48.566 --> 00:45:48.950
Yeah.

00:45:48.950 --> 00:45:49.450
It's like--

00:45:49.450 --> 00:45:50.583
It's very much as facade.

00:45:50.583 --> 00:45:51.433
Like a billboard.

00:45:51.433 --> 00:45:51.516
It's like a billboard.

00:45:51.516 --> 00:45:53.300
It's like a billboard,
that's right.

00:45:53.300 --> 00:45:56.100
Walking in the door, you
discover the real house

00:45:56.100 --> 00:45:57.416
behind the billboard.

00:45:57.416 --> 00:45:59.250
Can you explain to me
what's going on here?

00:45:59.250 --> 00:45:59.750
Why--

00:45:59.750 --> 00:46:02.316
In the living room,
an oversized fireplace

00:46:02.316 --> 00:46:04.933
jockeys for position
with a stairway.

00:46:04.933 --> 00:46:07.483
The stairs, at first,
widen, but then

00:46:07.483 --> 00:46:11.550
they narrow to squeeze
around the real chimney.

00:46:11.550 --> 00:46:13.233
It's an illogical step.

00:46:13.233 --> 00:46:14.533
You said it's illogical?

00:46:14.533 --> 00:46:17.916
It's an illogical step because
it gets wider as you go up.

00:46:17.916 --> 00:46:22.766
Really, this clashing of
things is the emotional center

00:46:22.766 --> 00:46:25.100
of this building.

00:46:25.100 --> 00:46:32.550
And then there's this stairway
that leads to nowhere.

00:46:32.550 --> 00:46:34.883
The idea here is
that while modernists

00:46:34.883 --> 00:46:38.150
fought so hard to
create order, this house

00:46:38.150 --> 00:46:41.200
recognizes awkwardness
and confusion.

00:46:41.200 --> 00:46:44.500
It embraces complexity
and contradiction.

00:46:44.500 --> 00:46:48.350
That, by the way, was the title
of Venturi's influential book.

00:46:48.350 --> 00:46:50.183
So Venturi might
say, it's important

00:46:50.183 --> 00:46:51.866
for there to be
that contradiction,

00:46:51.866 --> 00:46:54.450
that the building should always
come around and surprise.

00:46:54.450 --> 00:46:58.216
And that the idea that an
architect has the capacity

00:46:58.216 --> 00:47:02.583
to come up with a perfect
ideal form is a flawed idea.

00:47:02.583 --> 00:47:05.066
And the architecture
world took notice.

00:47:05.066 --> 00:47:07.300
Not long after Vanna
Venturi moved in,

00:47:07.300 --> 00:47:11.916
visitors started showing up on
her doorstep by the busload.

00:47:11.916 --> 00:47:14.366
I think she enjoyed it.

00:47:14.366 --> 00:47:17.616
She could sit and give a
seminar man at this table.

00:47:17.616 --> 00:47:19.950
And telling stories
about her son

00:47:19.950 --> 00:47:22.650
when he was a little boy
and all that nonsense.

00:47:22.650 --> 00:47:25.366
Soon, Mrs. Venturi's
little house

00:47:25.366 --> 00:47:29.683
became a source of inspiration
for thousands of architects.

00:47:29.683 --> 00:47:32.383
Postmodernism, as
it became known,

00:47:32.383 --> 00:47:34.850
started showing up
everywhere from skyscrapers

00:47:34.850 --> 00:47:36.450
to strip malls.

00:47:36.450 --> 00:47:38.316
Many real estate
developers simply

00:47:38.316 --> 00:47:41.816
saw it as a cheap and easy
way to brand their buildings

00:47:41.816 --> 00:47:43.916
by slapping
historical references

00:47:43.916 --> 00:47:46.216
on a billboard-like facade.

00:47:46.216 --> 00:47:50.250
And so just as the
world is plastered

00:47:50.250 --> 00:47:53.966
with examples of bad modern
architecture, well, guess what?

00:47:53.966 --> 00:47:57.616
There are thousands of examples
of postmodern architecture

00:47:57.616 --> 00:47:59.383
that's just as bad.

00:47:59.383 --> 00:48:02.483
God awful wedding cake
imitation of history

00:48:02.483 --> 00:48:04.233
made to look quasi historical.

00:48:04.233 --> 00:48:07.600
Or worse, abstracted
into some kind

00:48:07.600 --> 00:48:11.200
of cartoon version of history.

00:48:11.200 --> 00:48:15.000
I wasn't trying
to be postmodern.

00:48:15.000 --> 00:48:20.616
Starting a movement was never
on Robert Venturi's agenda.

00:48:20.616 --> 00:48:23.050
Don't trust an architect who's
trying to start a movement.

00:48:23.050 --> 00:48:23.933
[LAUGHTER]

00:48:33.016 --> 00:48:34.800
When Walt Disney's
widow announced

00:48:34.800 --> 00:48:37.500
that she would help pay
for a new classical music

00:48:37.500 --> 00:48:40.250
hall for Los Angeles,
many expected

00:48:40.250 --> 00:48:42.966
a conservative building.

00:48:42.966 --> 00:48:46.350
The architect says the Disney
family's own lawyer requested

00:48:46.350 --> 00:48:50.200
traditional touches
like brass handrails.

00:48:50.200 --> 00:48:52.500
So I put more breath
handrails in--

00:48:52.500 --> 00:48:53.100
[LAUGHTER]

00:48:53.100 --> 00:48:56.600
--than was necessary
for that guy.

00:48:56.600 --> 00:48:57.966
And I brought him
over here and I

00:48:57.966 --> 00:49:00.683
said, is that enough
brass handrails for you?

00:49:00.683 --> 00:49:04.966
Today, Frank Gehry is arguably
America's most acclaimed living

00:49:04.966 --> 00:49:08.800
architect, known for building
splashy cultural institutions

00:49:08.800 --> 00:49:10.400
around the world.

00:49:10.400 --> 00:49:13.850
But back in 1988, he was a
long shot in the competition

00:49:13.850 --> 00:49:17.250
to design this concert
hall in his own hometown.

00:49:17.250 --> 00:49:19.250
It was the least
likeliest thing that I

00:49:19.250 --> 00:49:21.283
thought would ever
happen to me in my life.

00:49:21.283 --> 00:49:25.066
You see, at the time Gehry was
known for his funky low budget

00:49:25.066 --> 00:49:27.350
buildings made with
the kinds of materials

00:49:27.350 --> 00:49:31.450
you'd never find in a classical
music hall, like plywood,

00:49:31.450 --> 00:49:34.650
raw sheet metal, and
chain link fence.

00:49:34.650 --> 00:49:38.450
Nobody had ever trusted him
with a large public building

00:49:38.450 --> 00:49:40.716
or a large budget before.

00:49:40.716 --> 00:49:42.583
So when Gehry entered
the competition

00:49:42.583 --> 00:49:45.050
to design the Walt
Disney Concert Hall,

00:49:45.050 --> 00:49:48.433
he says that Disney family
lawyer had a word with him.

00:49:48.433 --> 00:49:51.316
He informed me that
under no circumstances

00:49:51.316 --> 00:49:54.700
would Walt Disney's name be on
any building that I designed.

00:49:54.700 --> 00:49:56.900
Undeterred, he
entered with a design

00:49:56.900 --> 00:50:00.166
that was inspired by the
populist spirit of Walt Disney

00:50:00.166 --> 00:50:01.633
himself.

00:50:01.633 --> 00:50:03.716
While a classical music
venue could end up

00:50:03.716 --> 00:50:06.250
feeling `stuffy`
and elitist, Gehry

00:50:06.250 --> 00:50:09.750
wanted this one to be
inviting and accessible.

00:50:09.750 --> 00:50:12.683
I always thought Walt
Disney stood for creativity.

00:50:12.683 --> 00:50:17.283
I never thought that I was going
to make Mickey Mouse and things

00:50:17.283 --> 00:50:18.066
all over the place.

00:50:18.066 --> 00:50:18.950
[LAUGHTER]

00:50:18.950 --> 00:50:22.950
It was that design that
caught Mrs. Disney's eye.

00:50:22.950 --> 00:50:24.750
Frank Gehry got the job.

00:50:24.750 --> 00:50:26.066
I couldn't believe it.

00:50:26.066 --> 00:50:28.950
But because of a long string
of financial and political

00:50:28.950 --> 00:50:31.983
problems, it would
be another 15 years

00:50:31.983 --> 00:50:34.033
before he could
finish the building.

00:50:34.033 --> 00:50:36.933
Gehry used the time to
take his winning entry

00:50:36.933 --> 00:50:40.966
and extensively redesign
it from the inside out.

00:50:40.966 --> 00:50:44.266
My notion was that
there's a box.

00:50:44.266 --> 00:50:46.333
Working with an
acoustical consultant,

00:50:46.333 --> 00:50:48.583
Gehry found that
a box shaped hall

00:50:48.583 --> 00:50:50.266
would produce the best sound.

00:50:50.266 --> 00:50:51.366
Like that.

00:50:51.366 --> 00:50:53.966
But within the confines
of that container,

00:50:53.966 --> 00:50:57.316
he wanted to figure out how to
create an intimate relationship

00:50:57.316 --> 00:50:59.716
between the audience
and the orchestra.

00:50:59.716 --> 00:51:02.200
Instead of seeing the
back of people's heads,

00:51:02.200 --> 00:51:03.666
you're looking at faces.

00:51:03.666 --> 00:51:06.466
The faces of the audience,
the faces of the orchestra.

00:51:06.466 --> 00:51:07.700
That's what he wanted.

00:51:07.700 --> 00:51:09.800
But the acoustician says,
it's got to be a box.

00:51:09.800 --> 00:51:12.616
So he's wriggling
within the box.

00:51:12.616 --> 00:51:15.816
Gehry's solution was to build
this sculptural saddle-shaped

00:51:15.816 --> 00:51:19.133
seating in which the
audience completely

00:51:19.133 --> 00:51:20.516
envelops the orchestra.

00:51:24.350 --> 00:51:28.433
That feeling does change
the way the orchestra plays.

00:51:28.433 --> 00:51:29.433
Because they feel it.

00:51:29.433 --> 00:51:30.066
They feel this.

00:51:30.066 --> 00:51:31.016
They feel the intimacy.

00:51:31.016 --> 00:51:33.200
And when they play better,
these guys respond better

00:51:33.200 --> 00:51:34.316
and these guys play better.

00:51:34.316 --> 00:51:35.916
Go it's a-- that.

00:51:35.916 --> 00:51:38.800
The billowing shapes are
echoed on the outside

00:51:38.800 --> 00:51:40.716
in stainless steel.

00:51:40.716 --> 00:51:43.866
They're inspired by
Gehry's love of sailing.

00:51:43.866 --> 00:51:46.966
These sails form a
rampant around building,

00:51:46.966 --> 00:51:50.100
which masks it's more
mundane inner workings.

00:51:50.100 --> 00:51:51.516
Well, the building's a box.

00:51:51.516 --> 00:51:52.016
Yeah.

00:51:52.016 --> 00:51:56.416
And I put their toilets
and elevators on each side.

00:51:56.416 --> 00:52:01.116
But the outside of the building,
you don't necessarily see that.

00:52:01.116 --> 00:52:03.683
Well, look at-- see that
wall-- those two walls.

00:52:03.683 --> 00:52:04.433
Uh huh.

00:52:04.433 --> 00:52:06.216
They're against the box.

00:52:06.216 --> 00:52:10.616
And all I did was
tweak the corner.

00:52:10.616 --> 00:52:15.466
And so once I did that, then the
next level down I did the same.

00:52:15.466 --> 00:52:17.350
In other places,
the architect says

00:52:17.350 --> 00:52:20.183
the shapes relate to the
building's neighbors,

00:52:20.183 --> 00:52:23.966
including the old music
hall across the street.

00:52:23.966 --> 00:52:26.700
That happened by accident.

00:52:26.700 --> 00:52:29.233
This building's
highly complex forms

00:52:29.233 --> 00:52:32.233
couldn't have been made in
the era before computers.

00:52:32.233 --> 00:52:35.400
Frank Gehry's office has
transformed the architecture

00:52:35.400 --> 00:52:38.166
business with its use of
software that was originally

00:52:38.166 --> 00:52:40.800
created to design fighter jets.

00:52:40.800 --> 00:52:43.800
There's a whole lot of
technology running around

00:52:43.800 --> 00:52:47.450
in what seems like
whimsical shape-making.

00:52:47.450 --> 00:52:50.066
Frank Gehry's unique
forms are rarely

00:52:50.066 --> 00:52:54.100
imitated by other architects,
but his pioneering technology

00:52:54.100 --> 00:52:56.533
and daring spirit
have offered us

00:52:56.533 --> 00:53:00.133
a new model for how to create
successful public buildings

00:53:00.133 --> 00:53:03.183
using adventuresome
architecture.

00:53:03.183 --> 00:53:06.083
I think Frank Gehry has
changed architecture.

00:53:06.083 --> 00:53:08.566
Disney Hall liberates
the spirits of everybody

00:53:08.566 --> 00:53:09.633
who walks by it.

00:53:09.633 --> 00:53:11.983
And I think, in
the same way, this

00:53:11.983 --> 00:53:15.483
has liberated
architects to be bold.

00:53:15.483 --> 00:53:19.750
Frank Gehry is part of a
bold American tradition.

00:53:19.750 --> 00:53:21.933
In this young country,
some architects

00:53:21.933 --> 00:53:26.066
have felt free to cast aside the
entrenched artistic traditions

00:53:26.066 --> 00:53:27.866
of the Old World.

00:53:27.866 --> 00:53:31.950
In America, architects have
been able to brazenly redefine

00:53:31.950 --> 00:53:34.966
what buildings should look
like, whether by reaching

00:53:34.966 --> 00:53:38.983
into the past to breathe
new life into old forms,

00:53:38.983 --> 00:53:42.750
by using the latest technology
to change the way we live,

00:53:42.750 --> 00:53:46.933
or by inventing forms
we've never seen before.

00:53:46.933 --> 00:53:49.466
They've shown that American
architecture isn't so much

00:53:49.466 --> 00:53:55.000
a single style as it is an
endless process of reinvention.

00:53:55.000 --> 00:53:56.766
There isn't a thing
you point at and say,

00:53:56.766 --> 00:53:59.916
ah, that's American
architecture.

00:53:59.916 --> 00:54:01.666
We beg, borrow, and steal.

00:54:01.666 --> 00:54:02.766
We reshape.

00:54:02.766 --> 00:54:05.066
And we create
interesting architecture,

00:54:05.066 --> 00:54:08.050
whether that's the wholly
original person of a Frank

00:54:08.050 --> 00:54:12.000
Lloyd Wright, the importation
of a Mies van der Rohe,

00:54:12.000 --> 00:54:14.950
or the complete
futurism of a new firm,

00:54:14.950 --> 00:54:17.650
we really relish, as
a nation, that sort

00:54:17.650 --> 00:54:18.700
of architectural ferment.

00:54:18.700 --> 00:54:19.600
We really do.

00:54:22.900 --> 00:54:26.533
[MUSIC PLAYING]
