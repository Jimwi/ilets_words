00:00:12.873 --> 00:00:15.135
I'm going to start
by telling you about an email

00:00:15.159 --> 00:00:16.968
that I saw in my inbox recently.

00:00:17.342 --> 00:00:20.167
Now, I have a pretty unusual inbox

00:00:20.191 --> 00:00:21.627
because I'm a therapist

00:00:21.651 --> 00:00:25.095
and I write an advice column
called "Dear Therapist,"

00:00:25.119 --> 00:00:27.563
so you can imagine what's in there.

00:00:27.587 --> 00:00:31.818
I mean, I've read thousands
of very personal letters

00:00:31.842 --> 00:00:34.108
from strangers all over the world.

00:00:34.555 --> 00:00:36.848
And these letters range
from heartbreak and loss,

00:00:36.872 --> 00:00:39.222
to spats with parents or siblings.

00:00:39.246 --> 00:00:41.647
I keep them in a folder on my laptop,

00:00:41.671 --> 00:00:44.404
and I've named it
"The Problems of Living."

00:00:44.428 --> 00:00:47.833
So, I get this email,
I get lots of emails just like this,

00:00:47.857 --> 00:00:50.215
and I want to bring you
into my world for a second

00:00:50.239 --> 00:00:52.468
and read you one of these letters.

00:00:52.492 --> 00:00:54.026
And here's how it goes.

00:00:58.698 --> 00:01:00.475
"Dear Therapist,

00:01:00.499 --> 00:01:01.936
I've been married for 10 years

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:04.642
and things were good
until a couple of years ago.

00:01:04.666 --> 00:01:07.437
That's when my husband
stopped wanting to have sex as much,

00:01:07.461 --> 00:01:09.310
and now we barely have sex at all."

00:01:09.334 --> 00:01:11.349
I'm sure you guys were not expecting this.

00:01:11.373 --> 00:01:12.374
(Laughter)

00:01:12.398 --> 00:01:15.637
"Well, last night I discovered
that for the past few months,

00:01:15.661 --> 00:01:18.202
he's been secretly having
long, late-night phone calls

00:01:18.226 --> 00:01:19.992
with a woman at his office.

00:01:20.016 --> 00:01:22.472
I googled her, and she's gorgeous.

00:01:22.496 --> 00:01:24.290
I can't believe this is happening.

00:01:24.314 --> 00:01:26.988
My father had an affair
with a coworker when I was young

00:01:27.012 --> 00:01:29.115
and it broke our family apart.

00:01:29.139 --> 00:01:31.504
Needless to say, I'm devastated.

00:01:31.528 --> 00:01:32.865
If I stay in this marriage,

00:01:32.889 --> 00:01:35.000
I'll never be able
to trust my husband again.

00:01:35.024 --> 00:01:37.413
But I don't want to put our kids
through a divorce,

00:01:37.437 --> 00:01:39.278
stepmom situation, etc.

00:01:39.302 --> 00:01:40.502
What should I do?"

00:01:42.743 --> 00:01:45.901
Well, what do you think she should do?

00:01:46.727 --> 00:01:47.965
If you got this letter,

00:01:47.989 --> 00:01:51.457
you might be thinking
about how painful infidelity is.

00:01:51.802 --> 00:01:54.937
Or maybe about how especially
painful it is here

00:01:54.961 --> 00:01:57.627
because of her experience
growing up with her father.

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:00.902
And like me, you'd probably
have some empathy for this woman,

00:02:00.926 --> 00:02:02.338
and you might even have some,

00:02:02.362 --> 00:02:03.806
how should I put this nicely,

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:07.084
let's just call them "not-so-positive"
feelings for her husband.

00:02:07.108 --> 00:02:10.064
Now, those are the kinds of things
that go through my mind too,

00:02:10.088 --> 00:02:12.096
when I'm reading
these letters in my inbox.

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:15.199
But I have to be really careful
when I respond to these letters

00:02:15.223 --> 00:02:19.198
because I know that every letter I get
is actually just a story

00:02:19.222 --> 00:02:21.150
written by a specific author.

00:02:21.174 --> 00:02:24.222
And that another version
of this story also exists.

00:02:24.246 --> 00:02:25.666
It always does.

00:02:26.166 --> 00:02:27.326
And I know this

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:29.602
because if I've learned
anything as a therapist,

00:02:29.626 --> 00:02:32.957
it's that we are all unreliable
narrators of our own lives.

00:02:33.306 --> 00:02:34.456
I am.

00:02:34.973 --> 00:02:36.123
You are.

00:02:36.497 --> 00:02:38.730
And so is everyone you know.

00:02:38.754 --> 00:02:40.714
Which I probably shouldn't have told you

00:02:40.738 --> 00:02:43.222
because now you're not
going to believe my TED Talk.

00:02:43.246 --> 00:02:45.611
Look, I don't mean
that we purposely mislead.

00:02:45.635 --> 00:02:48.747
Most of what people tell me
is absolutely true,

00:02:48.771 --> 00:02:51.032
just from their current points of view.

00:02:51.056 --> 00:02:53.484
Depending on what
they emphasize or minimize,

00:02:53.508 --> 00:02:55.417
what they leave in, what they leave out,

00:02:55.441 --> 00:02:57.457
what they see and want me to see,

00:02:57.481 --> 00:03:00.155
they tell their stories
in a particular way.

00:03:00.179 --> 00:03:03.418
The psychologist Jerome Bruner
described this beautifully -- he said,

00:03:03.442 --> 00:03:07.601
"To tell a story is, inescapably,
to take a moral stance."

00:03:07.966 --> 00:03:10.601
All of us walk around
with stories about our lives.

00:03:10.625 --> 00:03:13.061
Why choices were made,
why things went wrong,

00:03:13.085 --> 00:03:14.958
why we treated someone a certain way --

00:03:14.982 --> 00:03:16.975
because obviously, they deserved it --

00:03:16.999 --> 00:03:18.937
why someone treated us a certain way --

00:03:18.961 --> 00:03:20.699
even though, obviously, we didn't.

00:03:20.723 --> 00:03:23.675
Stories are the way
we make sense of our lives.

00:03:23.699 --> 00:03:26.389
But what happens when the stories we tell

00:03:26.413 --> 00:03:29.936
are misleading or incomplete
or just wrong?

00:03:30.929 --> 00:03:32.609
Well, instead of providing clarity,

00:03:32.633 --> 00:03:34.491
these stories keep us stuck.

00:03:34.515 --> 00:03:37.737
We assume that our circumstances
shape our stories.

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:40.263
But what I found time and again in my work

00:03:40.287 --> 00:03:42.238
is that the exact opposite happens.

00:03:42.262 --> 00:03:45.857
The way we narrate our lives
shapes what they become.

00:03:46.989 --> 00:03:48.568
That's the danger of our stories,

00:03:48.592 --> 00:03:50.274
because they can really mess us up,

00:03:50.298 --> 00:03:51.544
but it's also their power.

00:03:51.568 --> 00:03:54.552
Because what it means
is that if we can change our stories,

00:03:54.576 --> 00:03:56.631
then we can change our lives.

00:03:56.655 --> 00:03:58.552
And today, I want to show you how.

00:03:59.624 --> 00:04:01.457
Now, I told you I'm a therapist,

00:04:01.481 --> 00:04:04.354
and I really am, I'm not being
an unreliable narrator.

00:04:04.378 --> 00:04:06.584
But if I'm, let's say, on an airplane,

00:04:06.608 --> 00:04:08.489
and someone asks what I do,

00:04:08.513 --> 00:04:10.637
I usually say I'm an editor.

00:04:11.017 --> 00:04:13.589
And I say that partly
because if I say I'm a therapist,

00:04:13.613 --> 00:04:16.597
I always get some awkward response, like,

00:04:16.621 --> 00:04:18.296
"Oh, a therapist.

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:20.468
Are you going to psychoanalyze me?"

00:04:20.492 --> 00:04:22.056
And I'm thinking, "A : no,

00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:24.484
and B: why would I do that here?

00:04:24.508 --> 00:04:26.008
If I said I was a gynecologist,

00:04:26.032 --> 00:04:28.699
would you ask if I were
about to give you a pelvic exam?"

00:04:28.723 --> 00:04:30.698
(Laughter)

00:04:31.207 --> 00:04:33.469
But the main reason I say I'm an editor

00:04:33.493 --> 00:04:35.017
is because it's true.

00:04:35.041 --> 00:04:37.722
Now, it's the job of all therapists
to help people edit,

00:04:37.746 --> 00:04:40.856
but what's interesting
about my specific role as Dear Therapist

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:43.571
is that when I edit,
I'm not just editing for one person.

00:04:43.595 --> 00:04:46.269
I'm trying to teach a whole group
of readers how to edit,

00:04:46.293 --> 00:04:48.301
using one letter each week as the example.

00:04:48.325 --> 00:04:49.968
So I'm thinking about things like,

00:04:49.992 --> 00:04:51.770
"What material is extraneous?"

00:04:51.794 --> 00:04:55.040
"Is the protagonist moving forward
or going in circles,

00:04:55.064 --> 00:04:58.207
are the supporting characters important
or are they a distraction?"

00:04:58.231 --> 00:05:00.364
"Do the plot points reveal a theme?"

00:05:00.699 --> 00:05:02.254
And what I've noticed

00:05:02.278 --> 00:05:06.278
is that most people's stories
tend to circle around two key themes.

00:05:06.302 --> 00:05:07.778
The first is freedom,

00:05:07.802 --> 00:05:09.579
and the second is change.

00:05:09.603 --> 00:05:10.833
And when I edit,

00:05:10.857 --> 00:05:12.949
those are the themes that I start with.

00:05:12.973 --> 00:05:15.671
So, let's take a look
at freedom for a second.

00:05:15.695 --> 00:05:18.449
Our stories about freedom go like this:

00:05:18.473 --> 00:05:20.338
we believe, in general,

00:05:20.362 --> 00:05:23.750
that we have an enormous
amount of freedom.

00:05:24.317 --> 00:05:26.397
Except when it comes
to the problem at hand,

00:05:26.421 --> 00:05:28.921
in which case, suddenly,
we feel like we have none.

00:05:28.945 --> 00:05:31.603
Many of our stories
are about feeling trapped, right?

00:05:31.627 --> 00:05:34.102
We feel imprisoned
by our families, our jobs,

00:05:34.126 --> 00:05:36.238
our relationships, our pasts.

00:05:36.599 --> 00:05:40.266
Sometimes, we even imprison ourselves
with a narrative of self-flagellation --

00:05:40.290 --> 00:05:42.179
I know you guys all know these stories.

00:05:42.203 --> 00:05:44.452
The "everyone's life
is better than mine" story,

00:05:44.476 --> 00:05:45.722
courtesy of social media.

00:05:45.746 --> 00:05:48.318
The "I'm an impostor" story,
the "I'm unlovable" story,

00:05:48.342 --> 00:05:50.540
the "nothing will ever
work out for me" story.

00:05:50.564 --> 00:05:53.101
The "when I say, 'Hey, Siri, '
and she doesn't answer,

00:05:53.125 --> 00:05:54.642
that means she hates me" story.

00:05:54.666 --> 00:05:56.727
I see you, see, I'm not the only one.

00:05:57.532 --> 00:05:59.437
The woman who wrote me that letter,

00:05:59.461 --> 00:06:01.349
she also feels trapped.

00:06:01.373 --> 00:06:04.222
If she stays with her husband,
she'll never trust him again,

00:06:04.246 --> 00:06:06.651
but if she leaves,
her children will suffer.

00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:09.920
Now, there's a cartoon
that I think is a perfect example

00:06:09.944 --> 00:06:12.468
of what's really going on
in these stories.

00:06:12.492 --> 00:06:14.898
The cartoon shows a prisoner
shaking the bars,

00:06:14.922 --> 00:06:16.944
desperately trying to get out.

00:06:16.968 --> 00:06:19.159
But on the right and the left, it's open.

00:06:19.183 --> 00:06:20.944
No bars.

00:06:20.968 --> 00:06:23.174
The prisoner isn't in jail.

00:06:23.977 --> 00:06:25.152
That's most of us.

00:06:25.176 --> 00:06:26.779
We feel completely trapped,

00:06:26.803 --> 00:06:28.898
stuck in our emotional jail cells.

00:06:28.922 --> 00:06:31.041
But we don't walk
around the bars to freedom

00:06:31.065 --> 00:06:33.199
because we know there's a catch.

00:06:33.223 --> 00:06:35.489
Freedom comes with responsibility.

00:06:35.802 --> 00:06:39.651
And if we take responsibility
for our role in the story,

00:06:39.675 --> 00:06:41.794
we might just have to change.

00:06:41.818 --> 00:06:45.056
And that's the other common theme
that I see in our stories: change.

00:06:45.080 --> 00:06:46.556
Those stories sound like this:

00:06:46.580 --> 00:06:48.786
a person says, "I want to change."

00:06:48.810 --> 00:06:50.777
But what they really mean is,

00:06:50.801 --> 00:06:54.024
"I want another character
in the story to change."

00:06:54.476 --> 00:06:56.206
Therapists describe this dilemma as:

00:06:56.230 --> 00:06:58.738
"If the queen had balls,
she'd be the king."

00:06:58.762 --> 00:06:59.921
I mean --

00:06:59.945 --> 00:07:00.945
(Laughter)

00:07:00.969 --> 00:07:02.873
It makes no sense, right?

00:07:03.923 --> 00:07:05.907
Why wouldn't we want the protagonist,

00:07:05.931 --> 00:07:08.336
who's the hero of the story, to change?

00:07:08.360 --> 00:07:09.987
Well, it might be because change,

00:07:10.011 --> 00:07:11.741
even really positive change,

00:07:11.765 --> 00:07:14.357
involves a surprising amount of loss.

00:07:14.381 --> 00:07:15.992
Loss of the familiar.

00:07:16.016 --> 00:07:19.349
Even if the familiar is unpleasant
or utterly miserable,

00:07:19.373 --> 00:07:21.857
at least we know the characters
and setting and plot,

00:07:21.881 --> 00:07:24.294
right down to the recurring
dialogue in this story.

00:07:24.318 --> 00:07:25.636
"You never do the laundry!"

00:07:25.660 --> 00:07:26.873
"I did it last time!"

00:07:26.897 --> 00:07:28.061
"Oh, yeah? When?"

00:07:28.085 --> 00:07:29.816
There's something oddly comforting

00:07:29.840 --> 00:07:32.190
about knowing exactly
how the story is going to go

00:07:32.214 --> 00:07:33.666
every single time.

00:07:34.170 --> 00:07:37.686
To write a new chapter
is to venture into the unknown.

00:07:37.710 --> 00:07:39.916
It's to stare at a blank page.

00:07:39.940 --> 00:07:41.503
And as any writer will tell you,

00:07:41.527 --> 00:07:44.098
there's nothing more terrifying
than a blank page.

00:07:44.476 --> 00:07:45.913
But here's the thing.

00:07:45.937 --> 00:07:47.960
Once we edit our story,

00:07:47.984 --> 00:07:51.118
the next chapter
becomes much easier to write.

00:07:51.459 --> 00:07:54.753
We talk so much in our culture
about getting to know ourselves.

00:07:54.777 --> 00:07:58.364
But part of getting to know yourself
is to unknow yourself.

00:07:58.388 --> 00:08:01.976
To let go of the one version of the story
you've been telling yourself

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:03.826
so that you can live your life,

00:08:03.850 --> 00:08:06.246
and not the story
that you've been telling yourself

00:08:06.270 --> 00:08:07.420
about your life.

00:08:07.897 --> 00:08:10.733
And that's how we walk around those bars.

00:08:11.297 --> 00:08:14.638
So I want to go back to the letter
from the woman, about the affair.

00:08:14.662 --> 00:08:16.773
She asked me what she should do.

00:08:16.797 --> 00:08:19.246
Now, I have this word
taped up in my office:

00:08:19.270 --> 00:08:21.254
ultracrepidarianism.

00:08:21.278 --> 00:08:25.873
The habit of giving advice or opinions
outside of one's knowledge or competence.

00:08:25.897 --> 00:08:27.175
It's a great word, right?

00:08:27.199 --> 00:08:29.160
You can use it in all different contexts,

00:08:29.184 --> 00:08:31.595
I'm sure you will be using it
after this TED Talk.

00:08:31.619 --> 00:08:34.530
I use it because it reminds me
that as a therapist,

00:08:34.554 --> 00:08:36.936
I can help people to sort out
what they want to do,

00:08:36.960 --> 00:08:39.428
but I can't make
their life choices for them.

00:08:39.754 --> 00:08:42.373
Only you can write your story,

00:08:42.397 --> 00:08:44.500
and all you need are some tools.

00:08:44.524 --> 00:08:45.815
So what I want to do

00:08:45.839 --> 00:08:48.632
is I want to edit this woman's letter
together, right here,

00:08:48.656 --> 00:08:51.688
as a way to show
how we can all revise our stories.

00:08:51.998 --> 00:08:54.172
And I want to start by asking you

00:08:54.196 --> 00:08:57.632
to think of a story
that you're telling yourself right now

00:08:57.656 --> 00:08:59.777
that might not be serving you well.

00:08:59.801 --> 00:09:02.865
It might be about a circumstance
you're experiencing,

00:09:02.889 --> 00:09:05.317
it might be about a person in your life,

00:09:05.341 --> 00:09:07.309
it might even be about yourself.

00:09:07.793 --> 00:09:10.725
And I want you to look
at the supporting characters.

00:09:10.749 --> 00:09:12.574
Who are the people who are helping you

00:09:12.598 --> 00:09:15.677
to uphold the wrong version of this story?

00:09:16.202 --> 00:09:18.615
For instance, if the woman
who wrote me that letter

00:09:18.639 --> 00:09:20.162
told her friends what happened,

00:09:20.186 --> 00:09:23.191
they would probably offer her
what's called "idiot compassion."

00:09:23.215 --> 00:09:25.715
Now, in idiot compassion,
we go along with the story,

00:09:25.739 --> 00:09:28.095
we say, "You're right, that's so unfair,"

00:09:28.119 --> 00:09:31.230
when a friend tells us that he didn't
get the promotion he wanted,

00:09:31.254 --> 00:09:34.025
even though we know this has happened
several times before

00:09:34.049 --> 00:09:36.097
because he doesn't really
put in the effort,

00:09:36.121 --> 00:09:38.188
and he probably
also steals office supplies.

00:09:38.212 --> 00:09:39.212
(Laughter)

00:09:39.236 --> 00:09:41.782
We say, "Yeah, you're right, he's a jerk,"

00:09:41.806 --> 00:09:44.803
when a friend tells us
that her boyfriend broke up with her,

00:09:44.827 --> 00:09:47.033
even though we know
that there are certain ways

00:09:47.057 --> 00:09:48.841
she tends to behave in relationships,

00:09:48.865 --> 00:09:51.691
like the incessant texting
or the going through his drawers,

00:09:51.715 --> 00:09:53.405
that tend to lead to this outcome.

00:09:53.429 --> 00:09:55.079
We see the problem, it's like,

00:09:55.103 --> 00:09:57.508
if a fight breaks out
in every bar you're going to,

00:09:57.532 --> 00:09:58.683
it might be you.

00:09:58.707 --> 00:10:00.968
(Laughter)

00:10:00.992 --> 00:10:04.691
In order to be good editors,
we need to offer wise compassion,

00:10:04.715 --> 00:10:07.216
not just to our friends, but to ourselves.

00:10:07.240 --> 00:10:10.193
This is what's called --
I think the technical term might be --

00:10:10.217 --> 00:10:12.684
"delivering compassionate truth bombs."

00:10:13.024 --> 00:10:14.953
And these truth bombs are compassionate,

00:10:14.977 --> 00:10:17.856
because they help us to see
what we've left out of the story.

00:10:17.880 --> 00:10:19.040
The truth is,

00:10:19.064 --> 00:10:21.786
we don't know if this woman's husband
is having an affair,

00:10:21.810 --> 00:10:24.558
or why their sex life
changed two years ago,

00:10:24.582 --> 00:10:27.709
or what those late-night
phone calls are really about.

00:10:27.733 --> 00:10:29.844
And it might be
that because of her history,

00:10:29.868 --> 00:10:32.479
she's writing a singular
story of betrayal,

00:10:32.503 --> 00:10:34.405
but there's probably something else

00:10:34.429 --> 00:10:37.373
that she's not willing
to let me, in her letter,

00:10:37.397 --> 00:10:39.397
or maybe even herself, to see.

00:10:40.143 --> 00:10:42.452
It's like that guy
who's taking a Rorschach test.

00:10:42.476 --> 00:10:44.326
You all know what Rorschach tests are?

00:10:44.350 --> 00:10:47.334
A psychologist shows you some ink blots,
they look like that,

00:10:47.358 --> 00:10:49.844
and asks, "What do you see?"

00:10:50.287 --> 00:10:52.763
So the guy looks
at his ink blot and he says,

00:10:52.787 --> 00:10:56.304
"Well, I definitely don't see blood."

00:10:57.675 --> 00:10:59.334
And the examiner says,

00:10:59.358 --> 00:11:02.812
"Alright, tell me what else
you definitely don't see."

00:11:03.622 --> 00:11:05.932
In writing, this is called point of view.

00:11:05.956 --> 00:11:08.709
What is the narrator not willing to see?

00:11:08.733 --> 00:11:11.709
So, I want to read you one more letter.

00:11:12.797 --> 00:11:15.042
And it goes like this.

00:11:16.860 --> 00:11:18.503
"Dear Therapist,

00:11:19.701 --> 00:11:21.597
I need help with my wife.

00:11:21.621 --> 00:11:23.525
Lately, everything I do irritates her,

00:11:23.549 --> 00:11:26.621
even small things, like the noise
I make when I chew.

00:11:27.214 --> 00:11:28.397
At breakfast,

00:11:28.421 --> 00:11:31.731
I noticed that she even tries
to secretly put extra milk in my granola

00:11:31.755 --> 00:11:33.041
so it won't be as crunchy."

00:11:33.065 --> 00:11:34.445
(Laughter)

00:11:34.469 --> 00:11:38.580
"I feel like she became critical of me
after my father died two years ago.

00:11:38.604 --> 00:11:39.882
I was very close with him,

00:11:39.906 --> 00:11:41.794
and her father left when she was young,

00:11:41.818 --> 00:11:44.381
so she couldn't relate
to what I was going through.

00:11:44.405 --> 00:11:47.238
There's a friend at work
whose father died a few months ago,

00:11:47.262 --> 00:11:48.952
and who understands my grief.

00:11:48.976 --> 00:11:52.064
I wish I could talk to my wife
like I talk to my friend,

00:11:52.088 --> 00:11:54.818
but I feel like she barely
tolerates me now.

00:11:54.842 --> 00:11:56.708
How can I get my wife back?"

00:11:57.318 --> 00:11:58.468
OK.

00:11:58.961 --> 00:12:01.326
So, what you probably picked up on

00:12:01.350 --> 00:12:04.278
is that this is the same story
I read you earlier,

00:12:04.302 --> 00:12:06.873
just told from another
narrator's point of view.

00:12:06.897 --> 00:12:09.294
Her story was about
a husband who's cheating,

00:12:09.318 --> 00:12:12.666
his story is about a wife
who can't understand his grief.

00:12:13.159 --> 00:12:16.477
But what's remarkable,
is that for all of their differences,

00:12:16.501 --> 00:12:20.405
what both of these stories are about
is a longing for connection.

00:12:20.825 --> 00:12:23.206
And if we can get out
of the first-person narration

00:12:23.230 --> 00:12:25.952
and write the story
from another character's perspective,

00:12:25.976 --> 00:12:28.849
suddenly that other character
becomes much more sympathetic,

00:12:28.873 --> 00:12:30.674
and the plot opens up.

00:12:31.342 --> 00:12:34.143
That's the hardest step
in the editing process,

00:12:34.167 --> 00:12:36.434
but it's also where change begins.

00:12:36.786 --> 00:12:40.326
What would happen
if you looked at your story

00:12:40.350 --> 00:12:43.238
and wrote it from another
person's point of view?

00:12:43.667 --> 00:12:47.127
What would you see now
from this wider perspective?

00:12:47.991 --> 00:12:50.230
That's why, when I see people
who are depressed,

00:12:50.254 --> 00:12:51.405
I sometimes say,

00:12:51.429 --> 00:12:54.548
"You are not the best person
to talk to you about you right now,"

00:12:54.572 --> 00:12:57.646
because depression distorts our stories
in a very particular way.

00:12:57.670 --> 00:12:59.226
It narrows our perspectives.

00:12:59.250 --> 00:13:02.583
The same is true when we feel
lonely or hurt or rejected.

00:13:02.607 --> 00:13:04.226
We create all kinds of stories,

00:13:04.250 --> 00:13:06.029
distorted through a very narrow lens

00:13:06.053 --> 00:13:08.370
that we don't even know
we're looking through.

00:13:08.680 --> 00:13:12.434
And then, we've effectively become
our own fake-news broadcasters.

00:13:13.482 --> 00:13:15.348
I have a confession to make.

00:13:15.998 --> 00:13:19.016
I wrote the husband's version
of the letter I read you.

00:13:19.040 --> 00:13:20.865
You have no idea how much time I spent

00:13:20.889 --> 00:13:23.326
debating between granola
and pita chips, by the way.

00:13:23.350 --> 00:13:26.488
I wrote it based on all
of the alternative narratives

00:13:26.512 --> 00:13:27.956
that I've seen over the years,

00:13:27.980 --> 00:13:31.699
not just in my therapy practice,
but also in my column.

00:13:31.723 --> 00:13:32.960
When it's happened

00:13:32.984 --> 00:13:35.230
that two people involved
in the same situation

00:13:35.254 --> 00:13:37.730
have written to me,
unbeknownst to the other,

00:13:37.754 --> 00:13:39.746
and I have two versions of the same story

00:13:39.770 --> 00:13:41.103
sitting in my inbox.

00:13:41.546 --> 00:13:43.234
That really has happened.

00:13:43.901 --> 00:13:46.828
I don't know what the other version
of this woman's letter is,

00:13:46.852 --> 00:13:48.321
but I do know this:

00:13:48.345 --> 00:13:49.678
she has to write it.

00:13:50.082 --> 00:13:52.127
Because with a courageous edit,

00:13:52.151 --> 00:13:55.953
she'll write a much more nuanced version
of her letter that she wrote to me.

00:13:55.977 --> 00:13:58.603
Even if her husband
is having an affair of any kind --

00:13:58.627 --> 00:14:00.357
and maybe he is --

00:14:00.381 --> 00:14:03.444
she doesn't need to know
what the plot is yet.

00:14:04.096 --> 00:14:06.984
Because just by virtue of doing an edit,

00:14:07.008 --> 00:14:10.320
she'll have so many more possibilities
for what the plot can become.

00:14:11.277 --> 00:14:14.832
Now, sometimes it happens
that I see people who are really stuck,

00:14:14.856 --> 00:14:17.784
and they're really invested
in their stuckness.

00:14:18.126 --> 00:14:20.702
We call them help-rejecting complainers.

00:14:20.726 --> 00:14:22.400
I'm sure you know people like this.

00:14:22.424 --> 00:14:25.480
They're the people who,
when you try to offer them a suggestion,

00:14:25.504 --> 00:14:30.353
they reject it with, "Yeah, no,
that will never work, because ..."

00:14:30.801 --> 00:14:34.119
"Yeah, no, that's impossible,
because I can't do that."

00:14:34.143 --> 00:14:38.349
"Yeah, I really want more friends,
but people are just so annoying."

00:14:38.373 --> 00:14:40.421
(Laughter)

00:14:40.445 --> 00:14:42.222
What they're really rejecting

00:14:42.246 --> 00:14:45.646
is an edit to their story
of misery and stuckness.

00:14:46.300 --> 00:14:49.514
And so, with these people,
I usually take a different approach.

00:14:49.538 --> 00:14:52.197
And what I do is I say something else.

00:14:52.221 --> 00:14:54.228
I say to them,

00:14:54.252 --> 00:14:56.148
"We're all going to die."

00:14:56.834 --> 00:14:59.603
I bet you're really glad
I'm not your therapist right now.

00:15:00.056 --> 00:15:01.405
Because they look back at me

00:15:01.429 --> 00:15:03.500
the way you're looking back
at me right now,

00:15:03.524 --> 00:15:05.183
with this look of utter confusion.

00:15:05.207 --> 00:15:07.302
But then I explain that there's a story

00:15:07.326 --> 00:15:10.103
that gets written
about all of us, eventually.

00:15:10.127 --> 00:15:11.727
It's called an obituary.

00:15:12.603 --> 00:15:17.016
And I say that instead of being
authors of our own unhappiness,

00:15:17.040 --> 00:15:20.325
we get to shape these stories
while we're still alive.

00:15:21.016 --> 00:15:23.643
We get to be the hero
and not the victim in our stories,

00:15:23.667 --> 00:15:26.572
we get to choose what goes on the page
that lives in our minds

00:15:26.596 --> 00:15:28.263
and shapes our realities.

00:15:29.096 --> 00:15:32.959
I tell them that life is about deciding
which stories to listen to

00:15:32.983 --> 00:15:34.665
and which ones need an edit.

00:15:34.689 --> 00:15:37.705
And that it's worth the effort
to go through a revision

00:15:37.729 --> 00:15:40.895
because there's nothing more important
to the quality of our lives

00:15:40.919 --> 00:15:43.103
than the stories
we tell ourselves about them.

00:15:43.127 --> 00:15:46.468
I say that when it comes
to the stories of our lives,

00:15:46.492 --> 00:15:50.373
we should be aiming for our own
personal Pulitzer Prize.

00:15:50.397 --> 00:15:53.266
Now, most of us aren't
help-rejecting complainers,

00:15:53.290 --> 00:15:55.643
or at least we don't believe we are.

00:15:55.667 --> 00:15:58.294
But it's a role
that is so easy to slip into

00:15:58.318 --> 00:16:01.529
when we feel anxious
or angry or vulnerable.

00:16:01.553 --> 00:16:04.116
So the next time
you're struggling with something,

00:16:04.140 --> 00:16:05.569
remember,

00:16:05.593 --> 00:16:07.116
we're all going to die.

00:16:07.140 --> 00:16:08.569
(Laughter)

00:16:08.593 --> 00:16:11.101
And then pull out your editing tools

00:16:11.125 --> 00:16:12.744
and ask yourself:

00:16:12.768 --> 00:16:15.720
what do I want my story to be?

00:16:16.929 --> 00:16:20.335
And then, go write your masterpiece.

00:16:20.716 --> 00:16:21.875
Thank you.

00:16:21.899 --> 00:16:24.526
(Applause)
