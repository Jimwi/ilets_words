Reviewer: Ellen Maloney

00:00:09.043 --> 00:00:11.145
Thank you very much for your attention.

00:00:11.145 --> 00:00:14.785
As the sign says, my name is Kyle Eschen.

00:00:14.785 --> 00:00:16.246
I'm a magician.

00:00:16.246 --> 00:00:19.453
Magic has been my hobby
for a number of years now.

00:00:19.453 --> 00:00:24.393
Some people have other hobbies
like stamp collecting or friendship.

00:00:24.408 --> 00:00:27.248
(Laughter)

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:29.109
Mine is magic.

00:00:29.109 --> 00:00:33.474
I will start with a cheap visual stunt
to grab your attention,

00:00:33.474 --> 00:00:37.714
and cover the fact that my act
is devoid of any intellectual content.

00:00:38.384 --> 00:00:41.680
Rivet your focus onto the handkerchief.

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:46.542
Now some of the more astute
among you may have realized

00:00:46.542 --> 00:00:49.029
that a transformation has taken place.

00:00:49.029 --> 00:00:50.831
(Laughter)

00:00:50.831 --> 00:00:51.953
It starts off...

00:00:51.953 --> 00:00:54.737
(Applause)

00:00:56.397 --> 00:01:00.098
It starts off silk,
yet it emerges a rayon blend.

00:01:00.098 --> 00:01:02.508
(Laughter)

00:01:02.508 --> 00:01:05.672
I am what you might call
a `sleight`-of-hand magician,

00:01:05.672 --> 00:01:10.668
which means I manipulate small objects
like handkerchiefs or playing cards.

00:01:11.118 --> 00:01:12.723
Sometimes when people hear this,

00:01:12.723 --> 00:01:14.781
they tell me that if I practice hard,

00:01:14.781 --> 00:01:18.468
I'll work my way up
to more elaborate stage productions

00:01:18.468 --> 00:01:22.269
with large objects, large boxes, animals.

00:01:23.039 --> 00:01:25.429
And to me, that's like
telling a violinist,

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:29.749
if she practices hard, someday
she will be able to play the cello.

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:32.769
(Laughter)

00:01:32.769 --> 00:01:35.869
(Cheers) (Applause)

00:01:38.955 --> 00:01:41.050
It's an understandable thing
to say though,

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:44.790
because people are not exposed
to magic in the same way

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:47.051
that they're exposed to music.

00:01:47.051 --> 00:01:51.491
Therefore, I am very happy to talk
to you here today at TEDxVienna

00:01:51.491 --> 00:01:54.572
about my enthusiasm for this art form.

00:01:54.572 --> 00:01:59.290
I am interested in magic
because I am fascinated with psychology.

00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:03.181
I love to learn about how people
make inferences about the world;

00:02:03.181 --> 00:02:07.885
how they draw conclusions
and find patterns and information.

00:02:07.885 --> 00:02:12.253
In particular, I'm interested
in all that can go wrong:

00:02:12.253 --> 00:02:14.453
how an individual can be led astray

00:02:14.453 --> 00:02:17.958
when certain cognitive
vulnerabilities are exploited,

00:02:17.958 --> 00:02:19.682
and I think that magic

00:02:19.682 --> 00:02:23.792
is a great way to explore these themes
in a borderline ethical fashion.

00:02:23.792 --> 00:02:25.982
(Laughter)

00:02:26.792 --> 00:02:30.301
So to do so, I will do two tricks tonight.

00:02:30.941 --> 00:02:36.828
The first is frankly horrible,
it brings shame upon my family,

00:02:36.828 --> 00:02:38.508
(Laughter)

00:02:38.508 --> 00:02:42.227
and pushes the word "asinine"
to new frontiers.

00:02:42.907 --> 00:02:43.895
I use it, however,

00:02:43.895 --> 00:02:45.896
because it illustrates a problem

00:02:45.896 --> 00:02:47.989
that I think is inherent
in a lot of magic,

00:02:47.989 --> 00:02:50.156
and I want to contrast it
to the second trick,

00:02:50.156 --> 00:02:54.040
which is better in that it brings
less shame upon my family.

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:55.937
(Laughter)

00:02:55.937 --> 00:03:00.332
It's the oldest trick in magic
at over 2000 years old,

00:03:00.332 --> 00:03:04.732
and it's primary method are some
psychological techniques,

00:03:05.752 --> 00:03:09.350
cultivated by countless magicians
over the centuries.

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:13.948
So it embodies everything
that I love about magic.

00:03:13.948 --> 00:03:18.914
But first, the asinine trick
which requires some props on this table,

00:03:18.914 --> 00:03:23.594
I will fetch them
in my typical flamboyant fashion.

00:03:27.669 --> 00:03:30.105
Two sticks of wood: suspended from each

00:03:30.105 --> 00:03:34.166
is a length of string -
a long one, and a short one,

00:03:34.166 --> 00:03:36.854
because variety is the spice of life.

00:03:36.854 --> 00:03:39.644
(Laughter)

00:03:43.995 --> 00:03:47.009
They trade off lengths -
nothing astonishing has happened yet -

00:03:47.009 --> 00:03:52.559
and yet I can now separate the front ends
of the sticks at a 30-degree angle.

00:03:52.559 --> 00:03:55.954
Now there is a video of me
doing this on YouTube,

00:03:55.954 --> 00:03:58.364
and someone in the comments wrote:

00:03:58.364 --> 00:04:01.694
"Actually, that's not 30 degrees,
that's more like 45 degrees."

00:04:01.694 --> 00:04:03.163
(Laughter)

00:04:03.163 --> 00:04:04.855
And I sighed in relief,

00:04:04.855 --> 00:04:08.525
because I knew the world's
intellectual future was safe.

00:04:08.525 --> 00:04:12.585
(Laughter) (Applause)

00:04:16.284 --> 00:04:20.634
Despite the fact that these sticks
are now separated by this gaping chasm,

00:04:20.634 --> 00:04:24.044
we find, to our delight and surprise,

00:04:24.784 --> 00:04:26.925
it's a miracle.

00:04:26.925 --> 00:04:30.745
Although, I do sense some people
in the audience have their suspicions,

00:04:30.745 --> 00:04:32.177
(Laughter)

00:04:32.177 --> 00:04:34.707
as to how this might be accomplished,

00:04:34.707 --> 00:04:37.368
and I thank you for not voicing them

00:04:37.368 --> 00:04:41.301
because as you all may know
I'm emotionally unstable.

00:04:41.301 --> 00:04:43.221
(Laugher)

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:48.356
You might think that instead
of being connected in the front,

00:04:48.356 --> 00:04:50.718
they're actually connected in the back.

00:04:50.718 --> 00:04:53.405
This would happen to be somewhat accurate.

00:04:53.405 --> 00:04:55.495
(Laughter)

00:04:58.478 --> 00:05:01.178
I shall rectify the situation.

00:05:09.285 --> 00:05:11.315
This is emasculating.

00:05:11.315 --> 00:05:13.340
(Laughter)

00:05:13.340 --> 00:05:16.025
The string has been lacerated.

00:05:16.025 --> 00:05:20.261
I brandish this in the air wildly,
because I'm young and invincible.

00:05:20.261 --> 00:05:22.501
(Laughter)

00:05:26.875 --> 00:05:29.976
I now separate the sticks
at a vast distance,

00:05:29.976 --> 00:05:33.310
yet oddly enough,
we find to our delight and surprise,

00:05:34.590 --> 00:05:36.696
now you all respect me as a person.

00:05:36.696 --> 00:05:40.082
(Laughter)

00:05:40.082 --> 00:05:41.055
Back and forth,

00:05:41.055 --> 00:05:44.783
they go in a monotonous
yet strangely amusing fashion,

00:05:44.783 --> 00:05:48.214
anything falling this
would certainly be an anti-climax.

00:05:48.774 --> 00:05:51.306
However, I will continue,

00:05:51.306 --> 00:05:54.701
because I'm contractually
obligated to fill 12 minutes.

00:05:54.701 --> 00:05:59.581
(Laughter) (Applause) (Cheers)

00:06:05.356 --> 00:06:10.896
A third magic wand
sits in my pocket, socially isolated,

00:06:10.896 --> 00:06:12.289
(Laughter)

00:06:12.289 --> 00:06:17.784
much like I was for a number of years,
until I learned magic and became accepted.

00:06:17.784 --> 00:06:19.044
(Laughter)

00:06:19.044 --> 00:06:20.921
These two go back and forth
just as before,

00:06:21.871 --> 00:06:23.921
the nostalgia is overwhelming.

00:06:23.921 --> 00:06:25.727
(Laughter)

00:06:25.727 --> 00:06:30.707
But to get the adrenaline levels
up in the room, all I do is pull here.

00:06:30.707 --> 00:06:32.980
Oh, how very `whimsical`.

00:06:32.980 --> 00:06:36.039
It's like a lyrical dance
of tassels and sticks.

00:06:36.039 --> 00:06:39.505
A phrase which oddly enough
I now use on a daily basis.

00:06:39.505 --> 00:06:44.065
It's the first time that expression
has ever been uttered on a TEDx stage.

00:06:45.435 --> 00:06:48.995
I keep doing this because, as you know,
if I had real magic powers,

00:06:48.995 --> 00:06:51.375
this is what I'd be doing all day.

00:06:51.375 --> 00:06:52.745
(Laughter)

00:06:56.445 --> 00:06:59.445
(Applause) (Cheers)

00:07:05.538 --> 00:07:07.855
Watch this image with your eyes, Vienna,

00:07:07.855 --> 00:07:11.655
because this is the picture perfect
representation of despair.

00:07:13.602 --> 00:07:15.107
I'm going to conclude now

00:07:15.107 --> 00:07:19.796
because the overwhelming emotion
in this room is one of irritation.

00:07:19.796 --> 00:07:22.726
I would explain why I think
this is a lousy trick.

00:07:23.427 --> 00:07:27.899
I think it's a lousy trick
because at its core, it's just a puzzle.

00:07:27.899 --> 00:07:28.907
And by that I mean,

00:07:28.907 --> 00:07:32.898
you might know how it's done,
you might not know,

00:07:32.898 --> 00:07:35.584
but either way, you just don't care.

00:07:35.584 --> 00:07:38.160
(Laughter)

00:07:38.160 --> 00:07:40.257
It doesn't tell you anything
about the world;

00:07:40.257 --> 00:07:43.603
doesn't tell you anything
about how people think,

00:07:43.603 --> 00:07:47.623
so with this next trick
I'm hoping to head into that territory.

00:07:47.623 --> 00:07:50.498
I will hand the props off
to a kind stranger

00:07:50.498 --> 00:07:52.522
who emerges from offstage.

00:07:52.522 --> 00:07:55.622
(Laughter)

00:08:00.900 --> 00:08:03.570
Thank you, kind stranger.

00:08:04.552 --> 00:08:08.710
This next trick is an example
of what is called "improvisational magic,"

00:08:08.710 --> 00:08:11.950
where I will do magic with any item
called out from the crowd.

00:08:11.950 --> 00:08:15.573
So it could be like the monitor,
my microphone, my tie.

00:08:16.643 --> 00:08:17.993
Oh! Who put these cups here.

00:08:17.993 --> 00:08:20.484
Maybe we should use these, I don't know.

00:08:20.484 --> 00:08:22.814
(Laughter)

00:08:23.474 --> 00:08:25.559
We require an examination of the props.

00:08:25.559 --> 00:08:29.384
You sir, would you mind standing up,
please look at these,

00:08:29.387 --> 00:08:32.247
make sure there are no secret
compartments or hidden objects,

00:08:32.247 --> 00:08:34.167
you can click them together if you want.

00:08:34.167 --> 00:08:36.700
Although, I will warn you
the amount of noise you make

00:08:36.700 --> 00:08:39.769
is directly proportional
to the audience's antagonism toward you,

00:08:39.769 --> 00:08:44.706
but just take a look at those cups,
I will set some context.

00:08:44.706 --> 00:08:47.193
In 1999, two psychologists,

00:08:47.193 --> 00:08:52.973
Daniel Simons and Christopher Jarvis,
ran a fascinating experiment

00:08:52.973 --> 00:08:56.049
that actually inspired this presentation.

00:08:57.169 --> 00:09:01.704
They had a video
of two teams playing basketball,

00:09:01.704 --> 00:09:04.593
and they asked subjects to watch it,
and count the times

00:09:04.593 --> 00:09:07.993
the basketball was passed
between teammates.

00:09:09.122 --> 00:09:10.959
During this whole process,

00:09:10.959 --> 00:09:15.092
an individual dressed
as a gorilla walks into the fray,

00:09:15.092 --> 00:09:19.762
beats its chest,
and then exits off-screen.

00:09:20.683 --> 00:09:23.743
Amazingly about half of the viewers

00:09:23.743 --> 00:09:27.353
were so fixated on tracking
the basketballs motion,

00:09:27.353 --> 00:09:30.057
they missed the gorilla entirely.

00:09:30.797 --> 00:09:33.905
And this is a phenomenon
called "inattentional blindness."

00:09:33.905 --> 00:09:39.865
It is a blind spot, not of vision,
but of perception and awareness.

00:09:39.865 --> 00:09:43.949
You can be looking right
at something and miss it entirely,

00:09:43.949 --> 00:09:48.293
because you only have limited
cognitive bandwidth in any given moment.

00:09:48.293 --> 00:09:54.293
So you focus in on what's important,
and you filter out the extraneous.

00:09:54.293 --> 00:09:55.523
And when I heard this,

00:09:55.523 --> 00:09:58.347
as a magician,
it really resonated with me,

00:09:58.347 --> 00:10:04.358
because my job is to make you confuse
what is important and what is extraneous.

00:10:04.358 --> 00:10:10.468
My job, in a nutshell, is to make you
filter out the wrong things.

00:10:10.468 --> 00:10:16.406
So I will move the table
center stage, retrieve the props.

00:10:17.156 --> 00:10:18.598
Thank you very much.

00:10:18.598 --> 00:10:21.505
Can we have a round of applause
for the gentleman for helping.

00:10:21.505 --> 00:10:23.695
(Applause)

00:10:26.255 --> 00:10:29.075
Because I don't do the magic,
we do the magic.

00:10:29.075 --> 00:10:32.005
(Laughter) (Cheers)

00:10:38.760 --> 00:10:44.051
A few more props are required
we have two red balls and a pen.

00:10:44.051 --> 00:10:49.851
These are made of compressible
sponge rubber, a lot of fun.

00:10:49.851 --> 00:10:51.553
But they don't stay around for long

00:10:51.553 --> 00:10:55.043
because all I do
is condescendingly wave the pen

00:10:55.043 --> 00:10:59.510
over the ball and we find
that it dissolves, it's gone.

00:10:59.510 --> 00:11:01.466
I'm just being theatrical at that point.

00:11:02.126 --> 00:11:05.450
Next ball disappears in full view,

00:11:06.690 --> 00:11:10.480
and then jumps back to beneath the cups.

00:11:10.480 --> 00:11:12.680
(Applause) (Cheers)

00:11:17.525 --> 00:11:23.285
Now a number of rapid effects
in tight succession

00:11:23.285 --> 00:11:26.585
to up my miracle to verbiage ratio,

00:11:26.585 --> 00:11:31.835
I will attempt to fracture your focus
across this confined arena.

00:11:31.835 --> 00:11:35.886
First, we will pocket the sponges

00:11:35.886 --> 00:11:38.340
and it will make the ball
return to the cup,

00:11:38.340 --> 00:11:41.010
not that one, this one over here.

00:11:41.410 --> 00:11:42.994
I can make this one appear too,

00:11:42.994 --> 00:11:47.914
just in a necessary flamboyant little tap
is all it takes for the ball to jump back,

00:11:47.914 --> 00:11:50.861
and you are all privy
to one of the most sacred moments

00:11:50.861 --> 00:11:52.865
in a young sponges life

00:11:52.865 --> 00:11:56.585
the point in which it first
undergoes mitosis.

00:11:56.585 --> 00:11:59.304
Watch the ball as it severs

00:12:00.704 --> 00:12:06.104
into two identical copies
fiber by fiber, strand by strand.

00:12:06.457 --> 00:12:10.258
And now, one last feat
before the grand finale,

00:12:11.798 --> 00:12:15.298
I'll put one ball in each hand.

00:12:16.408 --> 00:12:19.618
Sir, would you mind saying
which any like more A or B?

00:12:19.618 --> 00:12:21.003
(Audience) A

00:12:21.003 --> 00:12:22.516
Thank you for not hesitating.

00:12:22.516 --> 00:12:23.848
Some people hesitate,

00:12:23.848 --> 00:12:26.905
as if this is a decision
of any consequence whatsoever.

00:12:26.905 --> 00:12:28.830
(Laughter)

00:12:30.220 --> 00:12:31.105
You say A.

00:12:31.105 --> 00:12:32.681
The ball melts away like this,

00:12:32.681 --> 00:12:35.654
and when you watch down here
the balls reconvene up here

00:12:35.654 --> 00:12:38.728
leaving us just back where we started.

00:12:38.728 --> 00:12:42.580
Now, the question you should
be asking yourself at this point,

00:12:42.580 --> 00:12:46.568
is what does this have to do
with inattentional blindness?

00:12:46.568 --> 00:12:47.919
What does this have to do

00:12:47.919 --> 00:12:52.157
with looking directly at something
and missing blatant activity.

00:12:52.157 --> 00:12:54.610
And the answer to that
is that these sponges

00:12:54.610 --> 00:12:58.062
are not the stars of this trick.

00:12:58.062 --> 00:13:03.482
They serve the same function
as the basketball in the gorilla study.

00:13:03.482 --> 00:13:06.381
They were just here to draw the gaze.

00:13:07.051 --> 00:13:10.893
The real purpose of this trick
was to do something for our bolder.

00:13:11.903 --> 00:13:13.902
Because beneath these cups,

00:13:13.902 --> 00:13:17.230
cups thoroughly scrutinized,
cups that have never left your view,

00:13:17.230 --> 00:13:22.140
we find citrus fruits; not one,
not two, but three.

00:13:22.165 --> 00:13:25.350
Citrus fruit: rock-solid limes
with the density of diamonds.

00:13:25.350 --> 00:13:26.519
Thank you very much.

00:13:26.519 --> 00:13:29.869
(Applause) (Cheers)

00:13:42.409 --> 00:13:44.136
I'm not done.

00:13:44.136 --> 00:13:45.296
(Laughter)

00:13:45.296 --> 00:13:48.626
I have an inspirational
little ending message.

00:13:49.238 --> 00:13:54.428
If you were to Google how to do
the 'cups and balls and lime trick,'

00:13:55.069 --> 00:13:58.229
the explanation you would receive
would go something like this:

00:13:58.229 --> 00:14:02.903
when people are not paying attention,
put the limes underneath the cups.

00:14:02.903 --> 00:14:04.913
(Laughter)

00:14:08.489 --> 00:14:09.546
That's it.

00:14:09.546 --> 00:14:12.448
That's how magic survives
in the age of Google,

00:14:12.448 --> 00:14:15.526
because there is no secret
but the great secret

00:14:15.526 --> 00:14:18.891
which is we have gaping
blind spots far bigger

00:14:18.891 --> 00:14:21.278
than our intuition would suggest.

00:14:21.278 --> 00:14:23.182
And to me, that is a beautiful idea,

00:14:23.182 --> 00:14:25.450
and one that animates
my interest in this art.

00:14:25.450 --> 00:14:27.874
It's been a pleasure
to share with you this evening.

00:14:27.874 --> 00:14:29.168
Thank you very much.

00:14:29.168 --> 00:14:32.518
(Applause) (Cheers)
