00:00:07.874 --> 00:00:09.974
I'm one of these confusing millenials

00:00:09.974 --> 00:00:13.084
that's managed to making a living
through a weird hobby.

00:00:13.858 --> 00:00:16.048
This hobby envolves making music

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:19.350
on retro consoles and machines

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:21.473
something known as Chiptune.

00:00:22.683 --> 00:00:24.333
With very little experience

00:00:24.435 --> 00:00:26.915
I learned to compose through programming

00:00:26.915 --> 00:00:30.715
or hacking this, a Nintendo Gameboy

00:00:31.362 --> 00:00:33.722
using a piece of homebrew software

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:38.099
called LSDJ or Little Sound DJ.

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:41.280
This allows me to treat the Gameboy

00:00:41.353 --> 00:00:44.301
as if it's a very basic synthesizer.

00:00:44.301 --> 00:00:47.571
So I can command it to generate a tone,

00:00:49.778 --> 00:00:51.657
which I can then craft into something

00:00:51.657 --> 00:00:53.555
that resembles a traditional instrument

00:00:53.555 --> 00:00:58.905
like a kick drum or a bassline.

00:01:07.423 --> 00:01:10.133
With those instruments I'd create a song.

00:01:10.599 --> 00:01:12.239
But it's a Gameboy right?

00:01:12.284 --> 00:01:14.142
That chippy sound is probably something

00:01:14.142 --> 00:01:17.492
that you remember from your childhood
or from when you were younger

00:01:17.892 --> 00:01:21.592
What you can do with it in music making
is incredibly limited

00:01:21.641 --> 00:01:24.491
and yet you can create an array of signs.

00:01:39.839 --> 00:01:41.819
These limitations force you to think

00:01:41.834 --> 00:01:46.394
very differently and to approach
creation in an entirely new light.

00:01:47.655 --> 00:01:50.227
As soon as I came across 
this scene, I was hooked

00:01:50.499 --> 00:01:53.829
and with only a novice knowledge 
on how to make music

00:01:53.845 --> 00:01:56.165
let alone make music on a Gameboy,

00:01:56.306 --> 00:01:57.926
I started to play with it

00:01:57.984 --> 00:02:01.634
see what it could do
and what I could do with it.

00:02:01.688 --> 00:02:04.028
I technically became a hacker.

00:02:04.478 --> 00:02:06.308
But it wasn't just me

00:02:06.328 --> 00:02:08.428
there was an entire collective of people

00:02:08.484 --> 00:02:10.434
from all over the world dedicated

00:02:10.501 --> 00:02:13.281
to cracking the capabilities of this tech

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:18.400
some on Commodore 64's 
or Amiga's or Atari's.

00:02:18.901 --> 00:02:20.571
They were hacking their toys

00:02:20.645 --> 00:02:23.835
to make music and digital art.

00:02:24.636 --> 00:02:27.456
They were hackers 
with a "Do It Yourself" attitude,

00:02:27.955 --> 00:02:30.615
expressing individualism through
these machines

00:02:30.665 --> 00:02:32.321
and forming an online movement

00:02:32.324 --> 00:02:34.974
to bring 'bedroom consoles' to the stage

00:02:34.974 --> 00:02:36.754
in front of live audiences.

00:02:37.501 --> 00:02:39.911
We had this ability to discover,

00:02:40.165 --> 00:02:42.895
create and share in the newly

00:02:42.942 --> 00:02:46.302
connected world, the Digital Era

00:02:46.303 --> 00:02:48.163
which was born of this concept

00:02:48.163 --> 00:02:49.403
of the hacker ethic.

00:02:49.403 --> 00:02:51.423
Something that's completely at odds

00:02:51.423 --> 00:02:53.718
with the rigid practices
of the Industrial Era.

00:02:54.379 --> 00:02:56.626
Ours was one of openness,

00:02:56.676 --> 00:02:58.813
creativity through computers

00:02:58.973 --> 00:03:01.373
and the prospect of a better world

00:03:01.424 --> 00:03:03.314
using technology and with it

00:03:03.335 --> 00:03:07.335
there came a sense that
anyone could be a hacker.

00:03:08.788 --> 00:03:10.599
So when I say hacker

00:03:10.644 --> 00:03:13.080
it's probably not too difficult to imagine

00:03:13.824 --> 00:03:18.326
the stereotypical hooded figure
maybe a cyber terrorist of some sort

00:03:18.703 --> 00:03:21.122
or maybe the guy fox mask comes to mind.

00:03:21.681 --> 00:03:27.813
But it used to be that a hacker was
an expert or an enthusiast of any kind.

00:03:27.961 --> 00:03:30.892
Someone who was inquisitive and passionate

00:03:31.055 --> 00:03:37.827
and found enjoyment in exploring
especially within technology.

00:03:37.912 --> 00:03:41.650
So with that description surely
any one of us could be a hacker.

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:45.987
I mean, it's in our nature to be
inquisitive and curious.

00:03:46.117 --> 00:03:49.458
We're all curious with our technology
in one way or another

00:03:49.589 --> 00:03:51.689
because I'm sure that each and
everyone of us

00:03:51.779 --> 00:03:52.878
myself included

00:03:52.878 --> 00:03:55.688
is guilty of sitting up
until 3 am in the morning

00:03:55.888 --> 00:04:00.219
in the depths of YouTube or
Facebook or Instagram or whatever

00:04:00.298 --> 00:04:02.298
knowing that you have to be up early

00:04:02.298 --> 00:04:06.391
but hey the Internet is that gift
that just keeps giving.

00:04:06.393 --> 00:04:10.179
But before we had these 
pocket sized super computers

00:04:10.814 --> 00:04:13.741
hackers would be known to 
explore their machines,

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:17.048
crack them open, see how they work,
what makes them tick.

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:20.019
If they didn't have something 
that worked for them

00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:21.590
they'd just make it themselves.

00:04:21.872 --> 00:04:25.569
Make their own software or
build their own machines.

00:04:25.809 --> 00:04:29.892
If they hadn't, the names Steve Jobs
or Steve Wozniak

00:04:29.892 --> 00:04:31.241
would be meaningless to us.

00:04:31.241 --> 00:04:36.698
We wouldn't even have personal computers,
let alone our smartphones and tablets.

00:04:37.962 --> 00:04:42.236
The first home computers were built
with the radical vision of the future

00:04:42.794 --> 00:04:45.704
that everyone should own 
a personal computer.

00:04:46.224 --> 00:04:50.612
And this spurred generations
of inquisitive creatives

00:04:50.805 --> 00:04:53.845
to recalibrate those very machines,

00:04:53.876 --> 00:04:55.755
and to repurpose them into something

00:04:55.773 --> 00:04:57.542
that they were never intended to be.

00:04:57.824 --> 00:05:00.880
Like me with this Gameboy, for example.

00:05:01.531 --> 00:05:04.716
This hacker activity 
was known to be joyful

00:05:04.716 --> 00:05:08.346
where overcoming problems
arised genuine curiosity

00:05:08.716 --> 00:05:11.076
and led to a want for more knowledge.

00:05:12.245 --> 00:05:15.066
Solutions would be deemed 
to have hacker value

00:05:15.285 --> 00:05:17.585
if they were executed with
cleverness,

00:05:17.836 --> 00:05:19.670
brilliance or finesse.

00:05:19.832 --> 00:05:23.525
And this made creativity
an essential part of meaning.

00:05:24.906 --> 00:05:25.625
Curiosity is the crocs 
of creativity afterall

00:05:28.748 --> 00:05:31.619
and it's in our nature to be creative.

00:05:32.887 --> 00:05:36.468
So I was blown away by this idea that

00:05:36.571 --> 00:05:38.240
you could make 
music on a Gameboy

00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:41.500
and I'm sure that some of you today
probably are as well.

00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:44.100
So at 16, I got myself kitted out.

00:05:44.373 --> 00:05:47.604
I dug out the old classic Gameboy

00:05:47.604 --> 00:05:49.704
from the depths of the toy cupboard,

00:05:49.704 --> 00:05:52.494
dusted it off and revived it 
with some fresh batteries.

00:05:52.914 --> 00:05:55.645
My LSDJ cartridge arrived

00:05:55.932 --> 00:05:59.461
and before I'd even gotten past 
the first few pages of the manual

00:05:59.563 --> 00:06:02.652
I was eagerly making some noise.

00:06:02.764 --> 00:06:06.243
I was determined to just make something

00:06:06.342 --> 00:06:09.534
and before I knew it, I had some songs.

00:06:09.681 --> 00:06:11.652
They were not good songs.

00:06:11.843 --> 00:06:13.903
They certainly weren't without heart

00:06:13.903 --> 00:06:16.366
but I was very overenthusiastic

00:06:16.366 --> 00:06:18.934
with melodies and didn't have
much sense of rhythm

00:06:19.114 --> 00:06:21.139
for it to feel like it was anything

00:06:21.139 --> 00:06:22.688
but they were mine,

00:06:22.713 --> 00:06:24.525
they were my own little creations

00:06:24.525 --> 00:06:25.895
crafted from nothing

00:06:25.895 --> 00:06:28.183
and I was proud of that.

00:06:28.473 --> 00:06:30.703
So I put them online

00:06:30.703 --> 00:06:34.633
and I awaited the email from Sony Records.

00:06:34.729 --> 00:06:36.488
But alas, no email!

00:06:37.910 --> 00:06:39.398
But I didn't need a lable

00:06:39.649 --> 00:06:41.481
it was the spirit of the Digital Age,

00:06:41.481 --> 00:06:44.598
I could just put them out into
the world online and hope

00:06:44.598 --> 00:06:47.759
that someone out there somewhere
might be interested in listening.

00:06:48.856 --> 00:06:50.727
And they were! Thankfully.

00:06:51.848 --> 00:06:57.788
Chiptune had it's own community
of visualists, artists, event promoters

00:06:58.008 --> 00:07:01.067
and fans spread out all over the globe.

00:07:02.040 --> 00:07:04.419
So eventually I got to travel,

00:07:04.609 --> 00:07:07.578
I met incredibly talented like minded individuals

00:07:07.608 --> 00:07:12.198
and this all gave me the confidence
to actually pursue a life of music,

00:07:12.443 --> 00:07:14.288
to continue exploring,

00:07:14.550 --> 00:07:16.539
and to follow my own path.

00:07:16.688 --> 00:07:21.737
It gave me this "Do It Yourself" attitude
that really stuck with me.

00:07:21.847 --> 00:07:24.706
And approaching music composition
with these constraints

00:07:25.226 --> 00:07:27.966
gave me almost a programmer's mindset.

00:07:28.267 --> 00:07:31.155
The writing process often 
provoked serendipity,

00:07:31.155 --> 00:07:33.013
there would be little happy accidents

00:07:33.556 --> 00:07:35.924
that would give birth to a new idea.

00:07:35.939 --> 00:07:40.185
And that kept the creative flow
forever interesting and refreshing.

00:07:41.347 --> 00:07:44.884
It was such a free means 
of self expression.

00:07:45.369 --> 00:07:48.548
There were no standards 
to be met to define its quality.

00:07:48.785 --> 00:07:50.318
And it was accessible.

00:07:51.723 --> 00:07:55.321
It forced me to to overcome 
limitations in a creative way.

00:07:55.592 --> 00:07:58.295
And that was no doubt
an important life lesson.

00:07:58.780 --> 00:08:01.801
But overall it was just fun!

00:08:02.051 --> 00:08:03.960
And this essence of fun

00:08:03.960 --> 00:08:06.432
is rooted within that hacker ethic

00:08:06.432 --> 00:08:11.244
achieving unexpected results through 
playfully cracking a constraint.

00:08:11.948 --> 00:08:15.606
Before Chiptune, a movement surfaced
in Europe in the late eightees

00:08:15.606 --> 00:08:17.204
called the Demo Scene.

00:08:17.656 --> 00:08:22.571
And it was probably the very first 
computer art subculture.

00:08:23.495 --> 00:08:28.012
It started out as what would probably 
now be any parent's nightmare,

00:08:29.068 --> 00:08:34.379
with a teenage boy, alone 
in his room with a computer.

00:08:36.501 --> 00:08:37.999
It's not what you're thinking!

00:08:39.649 --> 00:08:41.660
Instead making art.

00:08:41.660 --> 00:08:43.649
These computer obsessed teens

00:08:44.309 --> 00:08:46.819
started to `flaunt` their programming skills

00:08:46.819 --> 00:08:49.270
through pirating or cracking softwares,

00:08:49.270 --> 00:08:51.329
something we're quite 
familiar with today.

00:08:51.329 --> 00:08:53.198
And they'd share it with their friends

00:08:53.208 --> 00:08:55.009
or other computer enthusiasts.

00:08:55.500 --> 00:08:58.957
Eventually these things 
called 'demos' started to appear

00:08:58.957 --> 00:09:00.588
when you'd open the file.

00:09:00.588 --> 00:09:03.078
They wanted to flaunt their talent right?

00:09:03.078 --> 00:09:07.455
So they'd create these audiovisual 
presentations that had insane

00:09:07.455 --> 00:09:09.525
graphics and music for the time.

00:09:10.384 --> 00:09:14.014
Sometimes they'd even talk smack
about other hacker groups

00:09:14.219 --> 00:09:16.295
presented for everyone to see

00:09:16.305 --> 00:09:19.367
like and early, but much more
innocent and creative form

00:09:19.416 --> 00:09:22.275
of the demonic YouTube
comment section.

00:09:23.085 --> 00:09:26.778
It got to the point where people
didn't even care about

00:09:26.779 --> 00:09:28.025
the software anymore.

00:09:28.025 --> 00:09:29.788
They just wanted to see these demos,

00:09:29.788 --> 00:09:31.848
they were really impressive.

00:09:31.986 --> 00:09:34.367
So eventually individual creators would

00:09:34.369 --> 00:09:36.804
team up to compete with one another

00:09:36.804 --> 00:09:39.254
at these things called 'demo parties',

00:09:39.254 --> 00:09:44.020
where huge crowds would assemble
to watch the results.

00:09:46.220 --> 00:09:47.643
Nerds!

00:09:48.913 --> 00:09:51.560
They'd compete like their 
lives depended on it,

00:09:51.560 --> 00:09:54.065
longing for that moment when
jaws hit the floor

00:09:54.065 --> 00:09:56.676
and people were just absolutely blown away

00:09:56.676 --> 00:09:58.092
by what they'd achieved.

00:09:58.929 --> 00:10:00.502
But what was it all for?

00:10:01.329 --> 00:10:02.493
Why did they do this?

00:10:03.293 --> 00:10:05.874
Honestly, it was for the art,

00:10:05.943 --> 00:10:08.634
it was for that final product.

00:10:09.784 --> 00:10:12.464
There wasn't exactly that big
prize money to be won

00:10:12.464 --> 00:10:14.984
and the parties weren't
exactly big budget.

00:10:14.984 --> 00:10:17.586
So rather than focus on 
commercial gain

00:10:17.659 --> 00:10:19.839
they worked to the extremes that they did

00:10:19.839 --> 00:10:23.629
because they loved doing it, it was fun!

00:10:24.118 --> 00:10:28.003
And like Chiptune, the musical 
love letter to the demo scene,

00:10:28.003 --> 00:10:31.314
this movement was dedicated
to cracking constraints

00:10:31.314 --> 00:10:33.558
and breaking boundaries.

00:10:33.918 --> 00:10:35.963
They were making things with computers

00:10:35.963 --> 00:10:39.274
that people did not believe
to be possible at the time.

00:10:40.199 --> 00:10:42.397
And because of their desire to create

00:10:42.568 --> 00:10:44.859
some went on to form
video game companies,

00:10:44.919 --> 00:10:46.818
or went into software development

00:10:46.835 --> 00:10:48.507
or animation, like Pixar.

00:10:49.546 --> 00:10:52.357
Something that they trained 
themselves to be.

00:10:53.476 --> 00:10:57.805
So I inadvertently became a
video game composer

00:10:57.805 --> 00:11:00.195
through my weird hobby.

00:11:04.097 --> 00:11:06.208
Without really realizing 
the scope of it

00:11:06.208 --> 00:11:08.268
I had created a brand for myself

00:11:08.268 --> 00:11:09.539
as a teenager.

00:11:09.614 --> 00:11:12.350
Marketing was something that 
almost came naturally

00:11:12.350 --> 00:11:14.620
to us who grew up with the Internet.

00:11:14.860 --> 00:11:17.343
Because creating an Internet persona

00:11:17.343 --> 00:11:21.353
was as simple as setting up your 
very first embarrassing email address.

00:11:22.505 --> 00:11:26.373
And growing up I was raised to 
understand the value of money

00:11:26.373 --> 00:11:27.838
not as a goal in life,

00:11:27.838 --> 00:11:29.908
but as a necessity for survival.

00:11:29.908 --> 00:11:33.473
To make a living doing something
that you love is the goal, right?

00:11:33.781 --> 00:11:35.581
And a hacker is not naïve.

00:11:35.699 --> 00:11:38.149
They understand that income is essential

00:11:38.149 --> 00:11:40.629
to have that freedom to create

00:11:40.637 --> 00:11:43.047
and to control your art.

00:11:43.085 --> 00:11:45.695
But this transition from simply playing

00:11:45.708 --> 00:11:51.208
to making a living was a complete
shock to the system for me.

00:11:51.617 --> 00:11:54.127
I think as adults we start to become

00:11:54.128 --> 00:11:56.188
systematic thinkers.

00:11:56.188 --> 00:11:59.398
We're constantly stretching logic

00:11:59.398 --> 00:12:01.198
trying to find answers to things

00:12:01.198 --> 00:12:04.328
that might not necessarily 
have a logical outcome.

00:12:04.799 --> 00:12:09.159
We can end up valuing our own 
worth through keeping score,

00:12:09.499 --> 00:12:11.609
comparing ourself to others,

00:12:11.609 --> 00:12:14.639
something that is very much
the driving force in school

00:12:14.639 --> 00:12:16.579
through our grading system

00:12:16.579 --> 00:12:21.009
and this competitive nature 
we're told defines success.

00:12:22.748 --> 00:12:25.748
And teen years come 
with a natural swagger.

00:12:25.748 --> 00:12:27.278
An ego.

00:12:27.278 --> 00:12:31.068
And this can give us the belief 
that anything is possible.

00:12:31.068 --> 00:12:34.098
But with an ego in the 
driving seat for too long,

00:12:34.116 --> 00:12:37.696
we can end up with this 
distorted vision of reality.

00:12:37.696 --> 00:12:39.196
A world of self

00:12:39.208 --> 00:12:41.218
based on our own perceptions

00:12:41.218 --> 00:12:45.318
and illusions, however
diminished or glorified.

00:12:45.338 --> 00:12:47.538
Where our understanding 
of our abilities

00:12:47.538 --> 00:12:49.498
is not what they are right now

00:12:49.498 --> 00:12:52.518
but rather what they 
should be in the future.

00:12:52.724 --> 00:12:54.434
And this can hold us back

00:12:54.434 --> 00:12:56.124
from moving forward.

00:12:56.478 --> 00:13:00.968
Or it can morph into
overconfidence and arrogance

00:13:00.994 --> 00:13:04.684
sometimes coupled with the
desire for fame or money,

00:13:04.684 --> 00:13:08.534
mimicking others or following
trends to find the spotlight.

00:13:08.534 --> 00:13:12.574
But arrogance brings no 
contribution to your work.

00:13:12.574 --> 00:13:14.574
Nor does it inspire others.

00:13:14.719 --> 00:13:17.319
In fact, it has the opposite effect.

00:13:17.319 --> 00:13:20.269
I'm sure that maybe we've all experienced

00:13:20.269 --> 00:13:22.039
a feeling of anxiety,

00:13:22.039 --> 00:13:23.399
of treading water,

00:13:23.399 --> 00:13:26.699
self `depreciation`,
trying to keep it all together.

00:13:26.699 --> 00:13:30.279
Sometimes the Digital Era 
can just set the bar so high

00:13:30.279 --> 00:13:31.539
that it's almost enough

00:13:31.539 --> 00:13:33.769
to stop you from even trying.

00:13:33.863 --> 00:13:35.283
But make no mistake,

00:13:35.473 --> 00:13:38.573
we are all born creative.

00:13:38.847 --> 00:13:41.467
Our academic studies 
may tell us otherwise,

00:13:41.467 --> 00:13:44.197
with such little focus on self discovery,

00:13:44.197 --> 00:13:46.887
creativity, and self advocacy.

00:13:47.033 --> 00:13:50.133
But we've been forever 
compared to one another

00:13:50.136 --> 00:13:51.816
in terms of our achievements

00:13:51.816 --> 00:13:53.036
and abilities.

00:13:53.036 --> 00:13:57.036
But comparison is the thief of joy,

00:13:57.182 --> 00:14:00.242
and any creator will 
know that all too well.

00:14:00.356 --> 00:14:03.916
That creative impulse is within all of us.

00:14:04.045 --> 00:14:06.805
Creativity comes from exploring

00:14:06.805 --> 00:14:08.525
and from being curious,

00:14:08.801 --> 00:14:12.581
doing what we could do 
and not what we should do.

00:14:13.583 --> 00:14:15.923
We're all eager to throw 
caution to the wind and

00:14:15.923 --> 00:14:18.153
go nuts with our imagination 
when we're kids

00:14:18.153 --> 00:14:19.658
but somewhere along the line

00:14:19.658 --> 00:14:21.948
this adult state of mind 
comes into play

00:14:21.948 --> 00:14:25.388
where we don't believe in ourselves
to go against the grain.

00:14:25.388 --> 00:14:26.868
Through discovering Chiptune

00:14:26.872 --> 00:14:30.392
I felt like I stepped into 
a world of the unknown.

00:14:30.832 --> 00:14:32.712
One with all the right sites,

00:14:34.259 --> 00:14:35.259
and signs

00:14:37.499 --> 00:14:38.460
and people.

00:14:39.480 --> 00:14:42.700
It resonated with me on a 
much higher scale.

00:14:43.246 --> 00:14:45.306
Here was a community of novice

00:14:45.306 --> 00:14:48.806
or self taught artists, 
just like the Demo Scene.

00:14:48.806 --> 00:14:51.736
A breeding ground for self expression,

00:14:51.736 --> 00:14:54.716
raw unedited talent without...

00:14:55.302 --> 00:14:57.432
with unfiltered emotion.

00:14:57.432 --> 00:15:00.562
And there was something 
incredibly beautiful about that.

00:15:01.211 --> 00:15:05.211
Tiny machines making huge sounds.

00:15:05.524 --> 00:15:08.154
I instantly fell in love with it.

00:15:09.411 --> 00:15:11.661
And the scene had an attitude,

00:15:11.854 --> 00:15:14.154
it didn't care what you thought.

00:15:14.221 --> 00:15:17.611
It was playfully wild and free,

00:15:17.611 --> 00:15:19.947
creatively beautiful in its own rights.

00:15:19.947 --> 00:15:24.227
Where having fun and dismissing 
standards was the focus.

00:15:24.482 --> 00:15:26.222
Each one of us had taken a...

00:15:26.222 --> 00:15:29.882
had resonated with this movement
in one way or another,

00:15:29.956 --> 00:15:32.616
and taken upon ourselves to join in,

00:15:32.616 --> 00:15:35.356
to push the limits of our creativity.

00:15:36.073 --> 00:15:41.153
And our artistic expression 
should be about absorbing life,

00:15:41.153 --> 00:15:44.533
our hopes, our aspirations, our fears,

00:15:44.533 --> 00:15:46.803
and creating something with it.

00:15:46.803 --> 00:15:49.153
There's a therapeutic value in creation.

00:15:49.153 --> 00:15:52.603
We can make sense of those emotions
through giving them an entity.

00:15:54.129 --> 00:15:56.429
The limitation that we must crack

00:15:56.429 --> 00:16:00.259
is to overcome what stops us
from getting creative

00:16:00.259 --> 00:16:02.119
or having fun with it.

00:16:02.459 --> 00:16:05.269
It's the essence of the Digital Era,

00:16:05.444 --> 00:16:10.844
where hackability is to participate
instead of being a passive consumer.

00:16:11.297 --> 00:16:13.807
We can invent the future that we want

00:16:13.807 --> 00:16:16.077
and not the one that we're given.

00:16:16.571 --> 00:16:20.211
So instead of staying up all 
night passively consuming,

00:16:20.291 --> 00:16:22.011
find your community

00:16:22.059 --> 00:16:25.259
or the people that will help you grow.

00:16:25.259 --> 00:16:30.069
Approach creation with wonder,
determination, curiosity,

00:16:30.450 --> 00:16:32.150
and create for yourself.

00:16:32.150 --> 00:16:34.440
You'll never know what will come of it.

00:16:34.865 --> 00:16:38.465
But above all, strive for authenticity,

00:16:39.411 --> 00:16:42.061
where the goal is not 
for money or fame

00:16:42.061 --> 00:16:44.671
or you will probably become lost.

00:16:44.671 --> 00:16:46.261
Find a bigger meaning,

00:16:46.437 --> 00:16:48.107
whatever it may be.

00:16:48.277 --> 00:16:50.147
Do it for yourself.

00:16:50.341 --> 00:16:51.681
Be a hacker

00:16:51.681 --> 00:16:54.521
and take that first step into the unknown.

00:16:54.806 --> 00:16:55.996
Thank you.
