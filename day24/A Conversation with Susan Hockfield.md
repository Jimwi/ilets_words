00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.417
(bell rings)

00:00:09.038 --> 00:00:10.455
- Good afternoon.

00:00:12.421 --> 00:00:16.588
I am overjoyed to see the
great crowd in front of us,

00:00:17.605 --> 00:00:20.855
and I welcome you to our second lecture

00:00:21.797 --> 00:00:25.964
in the series on designing
the futures of the university.

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:30.603
We're delighted to have a guest to join us

00:00:30.603 --> 00:00:34.103
who is Susan Hockfield, the 16th president

00:00:35.078 --> 00:00:39.540
of the Massachusets
Institute of Technology.

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:43.707
She was the first woman and
first life scientist to hold

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:47.710
the title of president of MIT,

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:51.877
and we're doubly proud to
note that she is an alumna

00:00:52.967 --> 00:00:55.762
of the Georgetown University
School of Medicine

00:00:55.762 --> 00:00:57.762
getting her PhD in 1979.

00:01:01.186 --> 00:01:03.436
This will be a conversation

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:08.218
between Professor Hockfield

00:01:08.218 --> 00:01:11.649
and our president, Jack DeGioia,

00:01:11.649 --> 00:01:13.869
a give and take with questions

00:01:13.869 --> 00:01:16.579
posed back and forth, undoubtedly,

00:01:16.579 --> 00:01:18.622
and then we'll open it up

00:01:18.622 --> 00:01:22.039
for your questions and dialogue among us.

00:01:23.169 --> 00:01:25.343
So I'm delighted to welcome you here,

00:01:25.343 --> 00:01:28.948
and we all look forward
to this conversation.

00:01:28.948 --> 00:01:29.943
- [Jack] Thank you very much.

00:01:29.943 --> 00:01:32.193
(applause)

00:01:37.141 --> 00:01:38.552
- Susan, welcome.

00:01:38.552 --> 00:01:40.473
It's incredible privilege
to have this opportunity

00:01:40.473 --> 00:01:41.723
to be with you.

00:01:43.034 --> 00:01:45.327
We've had a chance to talk a little bit

00:01:45.327 --> 00:01:49.239
in anticipation of being
with you all today.

00:01:49.239 --> 00:01:51.877
One of the underlying assumptions

00:01:51.877 --> 00:01:54.361
that has been guiding
our work in this project

00:01:54.361 --> 00:01:56.590
on the futures of the university

00:01:56.590 --> 00:01:58.523
is a recognition that while we're facing

00:01:58.523 --> 00:02:01.405
some of the most disruptive threats

00:02:01.405 --> 00:02:03.921
in the history of higher education,

00:02:03.921 --> 00:02:07.837
this is an unprecedented moment
of new things coming at us.

00:02:07.837 --> 00:02:10.971
We also think it's in a moment
of incredibly opportunity,

00:02:10.971 --> 00:02:13.569
and if universities can find the best way

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:16.095
to organize themselves to respond,

00:02:16.095 --> 00:02:19.403
we might be able to do some
really extraordinary things.

00:02:19.403 --> 00:02:22.608
Now I know this is a
sensibility that you share,

00:02:22.608 --> 00:02:25.751
and I'd love to hear how
you thought about that,

00:02:25.751 --> 00:02:29.234
how you embraced that during
your years running MIT.

00:02:29.234 --> 00:02:31.585
- Well thank you, and
during my time at Yale

00:02:31.585 --> 00:02:33.710
as a faculty member and dean and provost,

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:35.677
I'm thrilled to be here, and
I just can't thank you enough

00:02:35.677 --> 00:02:38.402
for inviting me to participate
in this conversation.

00:02:38.402 --> 00:02:42.569
I had a chance to read your
president's opening piece

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:45.364
on the challenges for the university,

00:02:45.364 --> 00:02:48.496
and it's brilliant, insightful,
and raises so many questions

00:02:48.496 --> 00:02:50.921
that are near and dear and terrifying

00:02:50.921 --> 00:02:52.409
to all of us.

00:02:52.409 --> 00:02:54.038
Change is a hard thing.

00:02:54.038 --> 00:02:57.773
One of the faculty members
at MIT said something to me

00:02:57.773 --> 00:02:59.068
just as I was starting.

00:02:59.068 --> 00:03:00.785
He said, well you know people are people.

00:03:00.785 --> 00:03:02.813
Somehow I had imagined
that the MIT faculty

00:03:02.813 --> 00:03:04.580
would be different.

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:07.369
And they are different in some ways,

00:03:07.369 --> 00:03:11.202
but the human brain in
general resists change.

00:03:13.072 --> 00:03:16.239
And we have to, all of us, balance our

00:03:17.896 --> 00:03:22.528
change aversion with the
extraordinary appetite

00:03:22.528 --> 00:03:25.348
that we all have for the new.

00:03:25.348 --> 00:03:27.771
And I think there's so
many wonderful things

00:03:27.771 --> 00:03:29.562
about the university, and we'll touch on

00:03:29.562 --> 00:03:31.132
I think many of them as we go forward,

00:03:31.132 --> 00:03:36.016
but managing change in an
institution that is 150 years old,

00:03:36.016 --> 00:03:39.535
hundreds of years old if
we think of the university

00:03:39.535 --> 00:03:43.452
in aggregate, I think is
a very critical issue,

00:03:45.113 --> 00:03:47.737
and I feel very strongly.

00:03:47.737 --> 00:03:49.862
You talk to people in business,

00:03:49.862 --> 00:03:51.839
and as the president of a university

00:03:51.839 --> 00:03:53.563
they look at you with a very long face

00:03:53.563 --> 00:03:54.834
and say oh my goodness,

00:03:54.834 --> 00:03:56.590
how do you manage all those prima donnas?

00:03:56.590 --> 00:04:00.173
Somehow that the faculty
is our opposition.

00:04:01.126 --> 00:04:04.008
The faculty is the leadership,

00:04:04.008 --> 00:04:07.248
and how do we use the faculty leadership

00:04:07.248 --> 00:04:10.560
to guide a university forward?

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:13.555
And the truth is that we
appoint and tenure our faculty

00:04:13.555 --> 00:04:14.913
because they're the
leaders in their field,

00:04:14.913 --> 00:04:17.208
and they can see beyond
the boundaries of the known

00:04:17.208 --> 00:04:20.422
with greater acuity than you or I could

00:04:20.422 --> 00:04:21.729
from the president's office.

00:04:21.729 --> 00:04:22.764
I mean what do we know?

00:04:22.764 --> 00:04:24.318
We might know our field,
but that rapidly goes away

00:04:24.318 --> 00:04:25.868
because you're not paying
attention to your field,

00:04:25.868 --> 00:04:28.174
so we really don't know about
the future of any field.

00:04:28.174 --> 00:04:32.599
So to use the faculty's skills
in looking into the future

00:04:32.599 --> 00:04:35.339
and persuade them to think
beyond their own disciplines

00:04:35.339 --> 00:04:37.570
is actually a very hard thing.

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:41.411
But I learned from my great
academic leadership mentor,

00:04:41.411 --> 00:04:42.978
Rick Levin, who was president of Yale

00:04:42.978 --> 00:04:45.398
when I was dean and provost,

00:04:45.398 --> 00:04:49.415
that the way to work at the
challenges of the university,

00:04:49.415 --> 00:04:51.793
opportunities of the university

00:04:51.793 --> 00:04:54.852
is to convene groups of faculty

00:04:54.852 --> 00:04:57.287
but unusual groups of faculty.

00:04:57.287 --> 00:04:59.699
So president Levin was a genius

00:04:59.699 --> 00:05:02.985
at finding people across
the university community,

00:05:02.985 --> 00:05:05.240
asking them to come together to puzzle

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:08.869
about the most important
challenges for the university.

00:05:08.869 --> 00:05:11.422
And these groups would come back with

00:05:11.422 --> 00:05:14.879
unsurprisingly, things we
had never really thought of.

00:05:14.879 --> 00:05:17.720
The things we had thought
of we would tell them about

00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:20.236
and ask them to mull through those,

00:05:20.236 --> 00:05:24.187
but it was such an incredible
lesson of how to use

00:05:24.187 --> 00:05:27.557
the intellect and the
creativity of the faculty

00:05:27.557 --> 00:05:29.954
to solve the problems of the university,

00:05:29.954 --> 00:05:32.467
and the thing again that struck me

00:05:32.467 --> 00:05:35.933
was that every time we
convened a committee

00:05:35.933 --> 00:05:38.433
to ponder a important problem,

00:05:39.704 --> 00:05:41.717
it was a different set of people.

00:05:41.717 --> 00:05:44.657
Maybe a third had been on a
committee like that before

00:05:44.657 --> 00:05:47.778
and the rest were new, and how exciting

00:05:47.778 --> 00:05:50.103
to bring these ideas
into the conversation,

00:05:50.103 --> 00:05:51.869
and I think it's absolutely
essential because what

00:05:51.869 --> 00:05:56.059
last thing you want in a
university is a kind of

00:05:56.059 --> 00:05:58.559
monotonicity in how you think.

00:06:00.038 --> 00:06:01.832
The great thing about the university is

00:06:01.832 --> 00:06:06.810
we've got this extraordinary
diversity of intellect

00:06:06.810 --> 00:06:09.414
and to put those intellects to the task

00:06:09.414 --> 00:06:11.155
of imagining the future of the university,

00:06:11.155 --> 00:06:13.565
as you clearly are doing here I think is

00:06:13.565 --> 00:06:16.110
incredibly valuable and fun.

00:06:16.110 --> 00:06:19.552
- I want to pick up on
the range of experiences

00:06:19.552 --> 00:06:20.475
that you had.

00:06:20.475 --> 00:06:21.725
So you were at Yale for

00:06:21.725 --> 00:06:23.730
as a faculty member, as the
dean of the graduate school,

00:06:23.730 --> 00:06:27.230
as provost, you moved to MIT as president.

00:06:28.327 --> 00:06:31.411
These are very different
kinds of institutions.

00:06:31.411 --> 00:06:34.947
In 1828, the Yale Report
basically established

00:06:34.947 --> 00:06:37.818
the foundation for liberal education,

00:06:37.818 --> 00:06:39.927
wrote the blueprint
really for how we think

00:06:39.927 --> 00:06:43.113
about liberal education
in the United States.

00:06:43.113 --> 00:06:46.482
35 years later or so, MIT is created.

00:06:46.482 --> 00:06:49.939
Very different kind of blueprint
for the kind of institution

00:06:49.939 --> 00:06:52.317
that MIT would be and the kinds of

00:06:52.317 --> 00:06:56.922
contributions it would try
to make as a university.

00:06:56.922 --> 00:06:59.258
What were the differences for you

00:06:59.258 --> 00:07:01.362
in these two different institutions?

00:07:01.362 --> 00:07:02.741
- You know I often talk about Yale and MIT

00:07:02.741 --> 00:07:04.991
as reciprocal institutions.

00:07:05.836 --> 00:07:08.978
I didn't know this when I
accepted the presidency of MIT.

00:07:08.978 --> 00:07:11.101
It would be hard to
imagine two institutions

00:07:11.101 --> 00:07:14.115
that were more different
than Yale and MIT,

00:07:14.115 --> 00:07:17.712
but I have to say, what I appreciate now

00:07:17.712 --> 00:07:19.885
is this is one of the greatest strengths

00:07:19.885 --> 00:07:21.600
of American higher education

00:07:21.600 --> 00:07:23.942
is the diversity of institutions,

00:07:23.942 --> 00:07:26.881
and to imagine somehow that
we're all doing the same thing

00:07:26.881 --> 00:07:28.549
or we're all doing the
same thing in the same way

00:07:28.549 --> 00:07:30.407
is just ludicrous.

00:07:30.407 --> 00:07:33.551
And so the freedom that
each institution has

00:07:33.551 --> 00:07:36.134
to imagine itself is wonderful,

00:07:37.774 --> 00:07:42.264
and if you compare the success
of American higher education

00:07:42.264 --> 00:07:45.576
to any other nation, I
think much of that success

00:07:45.576 --> 00:07:47.659
comes from this autonomy,

00:07:48.562 --> 00:07:49.728
and even though we're different,

00:07:49.728 --> 00:07:51.339
we compete fiercely with one another.

00:07:51.339 --> 00:07:53.230
It's not that MIT and Yale don't compete

00:07:53.230 --> 00:07:54.709
on certain playing fields.

00:07:54.709 --> 00:07:56.686
We certainly do.

00:07:56.686 --> 00:07:58.853
But it is a great benefit.

00:08:03.851 --> 00:08:08.018
So Yale did write the blueprint
for liberal arts education.

00:08:09.357 --> 00:08:12.525
In many ways, MIT wrote the blueprint

00:08:12.525 --> 00:08:16.160
for science and engineering
education with liberal arts.

00:08:16.160 --> 00:08:19.292
I mean people forget that MIT has

00:08:19.292 --> 00:08:21.209
adamantly liberal arts,

00:08:22.351 --> 00:08:26.408
but the style of education and
the purpose of the university

00:08:26.408 --> 00:08:30.081
at MIT is very different
from that imagined by Yale.

00:08:30.081 --> 00:08:32.756
So at the heart of Yale is the humanities

00:08:32.756 --> 00:08:34.016
and social sciences.

00:08:34.016 --> 00:08:36.680
At the heart of MIT is
science and engineering.

00:08:36.680 --> 00:08:39.966
Create very different cultures
with different assumptions,

00:08:39.966 --> 00:08:42.282
different ways of approaching problems,

00:08:42.282 --> 00:08:44.780
but I think one of the other
fascinating things for me,

00:08:44.780 --> 00:08:48.382
if you look at the history of
higher education in America,

00:08:48.382 --> 00:08:51.103
Harvard, Brown, Princeton, Yale,

00:08:51.103 --> 00:08:53.610
these schools were all
begun as divinity schools

00:08:53.610 --> 00:08:57.657
because what the new nation
needed was ministers,

00:08:57.657 --> 00:09:01.891
and that was what universities,
colleges then were for.

00:09:01.891 --> 00:09:06.058
And it's important when
you're in that line of work

00:09:07.821 --> 00:09:11.180
to have a separation
between the real world

00:09:11.180 --> 00:09:13.098
and the world of the mind,

00:09:13.098 --> 00:09:16.605
and so there is a sense of the ivory tower

00:09:16.605 --> 00:09:18.938
and a place removed from the

00:09:20.738 --> 00:09:22.488
rigors of daily life.

00:09:24.172 --> 00:09:28.499
MIT, founded in 1865,
its premise was we needed

00:09:28.499 --> 00:09:31.018
a new kind of university to accelerate

00:09:31.018 --> 00:09:33.092
the industrialization of America.

00:09:33.092 --> 00:09:34.989
The industrial revolution was happening.

00:09:34.989 --> 00:09:38.612
We weren't educating anyone who
could lead these industries.

00:09:38.612 --> 00:09:42.129
Agriculture needed to
step up the game because

00:09:42.129 --> 00:09:45.212
as now, everyone was worried
there wouldn't be enough food,

00:09:45.212 --> 00:09:47.481
and we needed to help farmers design

00:09:47.481 --> 00:09:49.727
more productive agricultural practices.

00:09:49.727 --> 00:09:51.392
Sounds a little familiar.

00:09:51.392 --> 00:09:54.103
And so the whole land
grant movement happened

00:09:54.103 --> 00:09:57.236
in order to provide the kind of education

00:09:57.236 --> 00:09:58.593
that the new nation needed,

00:09:58.593 --> 00:09:59.945
and MIT very much in leadership.

00:09:59.945 --> 00:10:01.844
so this idea about hands on learning

00:10:01.844 --> 00:10:03.106
that there will be laboratories

00:10:03.106 --> 00:10:05.048
where you'd actually get
your hands wet making stuff,

00:10:05.048 --> 00:10:06.131
this was new.

00:10:07.642 --> 00:10:10.194
So one of the themes at
MIT is learning by doing.

00:10:10.194 --> 00:10:11.718
We really mean learning by doing,

00:10:11.718 --> 00:10:15.487
and what I often say about
MIT is MIT was designed

00:10:15.487 --> 00:10:17.067
to do tech transfer.

00:10:17.067 --> 00:10:19.914
That was one of the fundamental principles

00:10:19.914 --> 00:10:21.830
of MIT's education,

00:10:21.830 --> 00:10:25.997
meaning engaging the real world
in real time in real ways.

00:10:27.159 --> 00:10:29.262
So very different

00:10:29.262 --> 00:10:31.469
from the premise of Ivy
League institutions.

00:10:31.469 --> 00:10:35.656
I just find this whole
thing absolutely fascinating

00:10:35.656 --> 00:10:40.405
and exciting in the sense of
all of the many different ways

00:10:40.405 --> 00:10:42.146
you can look at higher education.

00:10:42.146 --> 00:10:44.234
Now, I mean it's inside baseball.

00:10:44.234 --> 00:10:45.577
You and I can appreciate it,

00:10:45.577 --> 00:10:47.736
but most people just think of
college as college as college,

00:10:47.736 --> 00:10:49.922
university as university,
but it really isn't,

00:10:49.922 --> 00:10:53.440
and I think that is one of
our nation's great strengths.

00:10:53.440 --> 00:10:56.740
- I want to pick up on a theme
embedded in your comments

00:10:56.740 --> 00:10:58.073
regarding place.

00:10:59.403 --> 00:11:02.320
Under your leadership,
you took OpenCourseWare,

00:11:02.320 --> 00:11:06.219
one of the great gifts
that MIT gave to the world

00:11:06.219 --> 00:11:09.886
and turned that into
MITx, which became edX,

00:11:10.923 --> 00:11:13.684
with the joint commitment of Harvard,

00:11:13.684 --> 00:11:15.686
and we were very fortunate to be

00:11:15.686 --> 00:11:19.853
invited early in to be a member
of the consortium on edX.

00:11:21.182 --> 00:11:23.739
But embedded in that is a tension

00:11:23.739 --> 00:11:26.285
between the importance of place

00:11:26.285 --> 00:11:28.766
and the role that technology can play

00:11:28.766 --> 00:11:31.753
in this moment in enhancing
the quality of the things

00:11:31.753 --> 00:11:34.624
that occur on our campuses.

00:11:34.624 --> 00:11:37.697
We built this building
just a few years ago.

00:11:37.697 --> 00:11:40.049
It really has made a big difference

00:11:40.049 --> 00:11:42.446
in terms of the interactions
that take place here.

00:11:42.446 --> 00:11:43.839
There are things that just didn't happen

00:11:43.839 --> 00:11:45.363
until we built this place.

00:11:45.363 --> 00:11:49.055
I know there's some fantastic
locations on the MIT campus

00:11:49.055 --> 00:11:51.663
where without that, I think you,

00:11:51.663 --> 00:11:54.843
I remember reading
something you read where,

00:11:54.843 --> 00:11:57.710
you wrote where you're talking
about creating opportunities

00:11:57.710 --> 00:12:00.879
for people to bump into one another.

00:12:00.879 --> 00:12:03.927
Place matters, and yet we're all engaged

00:12:03.927 --> 00:12:06.147
in this new technology revolution.

00:12:06.147 --> 00:12:08.235
How do you think about that balance?

00:12:08.235 --> 00:12:12.402
- Yeah, so important questions,
fascinating questions.

00:12:14.759 --> 00:12:18.267
Truth be told, what was in
my mind, my predecessor,

00:12:18.267 --> 00:12:21.783
unfortunately the
recently late Chuck Vest,

00:12:21.783 --> 00:12:24.459
started OpenCourseWare, and
it was just getting started

00:12:24.459 --> 00:12:25.491
when I arrived.

00:12:25.491 --> 00:12:27.470
I sure didn't understand
it until I got to MIT,

00:12:27.470 --> 00:12:31.137
and then I was kind of
stunned by the power,

00:12:32.618 --> 00:12:35.285
the potential of OpenCourseWare.

00:12:36.316 --> 00:12:38.006
But when, a couple things.

00:12:38.006 --> 00:12:39.627
So OpenCourseWare started.

00:12:39.627 --> 00:12:42.326
MIT started a distance
learning collaboration

00:12:42.326 --> 00:12:45.096
with Singapore about the same time

00:12:45.096 --> 00:12:48.979
teaching a course in real
time to a classroom at MIT

00:12:48.979 --> 00:12:52.859
and one 12 hours away, 12 hours
time zone away in Singapore,

00:12:52.859 --> 00:12:54.978
and what we saw was that every time,

00:12:54.978 --> 00:12:57.402
virtually every time a faculty member

00:12:57.402 --> 00:12:59.319
put her or his material

00:13:00.835 --> 00:13:03.502
or the course on OpenCourseWare,

00:13:05.572 --> 00:13:08.489
they discovered a new way to teach.

00:13:09.377 --> 00:13:12.561
The faculty who participated
in the Singapore MIT alliance,

00:13:12.561 --> 00:13:16.639
this distance learning,
distance and present learning,

00:13:16.639 --> 00:13:21.463
similarly told me that they
changed the way they taught,

00:13:21.463 --> 00:13:25.412
and what was revealed to me
is that we can't just ask

00:13:25.412 --> 00:13:29.264
our faculty to invent
new pedagogical tools.

00:13:29.264 --> 00:13:30.928
Just go do it, right?

00:13:30.928 --> 00:13:33.270
Without giving them laboratories.

00:13:33.270 --> 00:13:36.353
So OpenCourseWare and SMA, MITx, edX,

00:13:38.467 --> 00:13:41.444
I think the most important
contribution they make

00:13:41.444 --> 00:13:45.277
is changing the way we
teach for our students.

00:13:46.697 --> 00:13:48.967
So the faculty who change
the way that they teach

00:13:48.967 --> 00:13:50.886
for OCW wasn't just for OCW.

00:13:50.886 --> 00:13:54.455
They changed the way they
taught in the classroom.

00:13:54.455 --> 00:13:58.459
So I think this is a little appreciated

00:13:58.459 --> 00:14:01.976
center piece of these new
teaching technologies.

00:14:01.976 --> 00:14:06.143
Look our students are arriving
born mobile, born digital,

00:14:07.386 --> 00:14:10.232
and to imagine that they will be compelled

00:14:10.232 --> 00:14:12.991
by the same kind of teaching technologies

00:14:12.991 --> 00:14:15.691
that have compelled students
for hundreds of years,

00:14:15.691 --> 00:14:17.539
I think is wishful thinking.

00:14:17.539 --> 00:14:20.552
And frankly, if we don't
use new technologies

00:14:20.552 --> 00:14:22.700
to improve our pedagogy to enhance it,

00:14:22.700 --> 00:14:25.243
to make it more compelling,

00:14:25.243 --> 00:14:27.056
I mean there are any number of ways

00:14:27.056 --> 00:14:29.765
you can think of making it better,

00:14:29.765 --> 00:14:31.098
is a disservice.

00:14:31.939 --> 00:14:35.886
And so all of these new ways of teaching,

00:14:35.886 --> 00:14:38.719
new ways of conveying information,

00:14:40.042 --> 00:14:41.709
I think at its heart

00:14:42.918 --> 00:14:45.957
are laboratories for new pedagogies.

00:14:45.957 --> 00:14:47.506
Enormously valuable.

00:14:47.506 --> 00:14:50.170
A side product is the
material is available

00:14:50.170 --> 00:14:53.071
to anyone in the world,
and that's fantastic.

00:14:53.071 --> 00:14:55.919
When OCW started, there was
of course a lot of concern

00:14:55.919 --> 00:14:58.531
about the erosion of the MIT brand.

00:14:58.531 --> 00:15:02.698
Why would people come to
campus if they could do OCW?

00:15:03.825 --> 00:15:05.758
More people wanted to come to campus

00:15:05.758 --> 00:15:07.160
following OCW.

00:15:07.160 --> 00:15:11.218
They're two very different
kinds of learning,

00:15:11.218 --> 00:15:12.051
but I am

00:15:14.230 --> 00:15:16.063
so persuaded by place,

00:15:18.993 --> 00:15:21.548
by the power of people coming together.

00:15:21.548 --> 00:15:22.894
I call this the magic.

00:15:22.894 --> 00:15:24.009
The magic happens.

00:15:24.009 --> 00:15:26.084
The magic happens when you have a group

00:15:26.084 --> 00:15:30.403
of incredibly gifted brilliant
people sitting around a table

00:15:30.403 --> 00:15:32.653
puzzling over some problem,

00:15:33.668 --> 00:15:36.357
and the magic is someone will have an idea

00:15:36.357 --> 00:15:40.355
that she or he would not
have had on their own.

00:15:40.355 --> 00:15:42.069
That's the magic.

00:15:42.069 --> 00:15:45.188
And so far, the digital
technologies are great.

00:15:45.188 --> 00:15:48.549
I'm not sure you actually get all of that,

00:15:48.549 --> 00:15:51.046
and so I think that in person education

00:15:51.046 --> 00:15:54.538
is going to continue to be compelling.

00:15:54.538 --> 00:15:55.681
It's going to continue.

00:15:55.681 --> 00:15:57.418
We're not going to be put
out of business anytime soon.

00:15:57.418 --> 00:15:59.265
So what happened with OpenCourseWare

00:15:59.265 --> 00:16:01.739
when I was president during
the first seven years of

00:16:01.739 --> 00:16:03.651
first eight years of OpenCourseWare,

00:16:03.651 --> 00:16:05.736
applications to MIT doubled.

00:16:05.736 --> 00:16:07.634
Not because I was president,

00:16:07.634 --> 00:16:10.070
but because this material was out there,

00:16:10.070 --> 00:16:12.425
and people were aware
of what MIT was doing,

00:16:12.425 --> 00:16:13.972
and they wanted to be a part of it,

00:16:13.972 --> 00:16:15.592
and I think that'll continue.

00:16:15.592 --> 00:16:17.848
But on the other hand, I mean I just,

00:16:17.848 --> 00:16:18.848
I'm so moved

00:16:20.381 --> 00:16:21.214
by the

00:16:23.776 --> 00:16:26.117
resource that we give the world.

00:16:26.117 --> 00:16:27.221
I'm so moved.

00:16:27.221 --> 00:16:29.513
There have been 150 million people

00:16:29.513 --> 00:16:31.602
who have used OpenCourseWare,

00:16:31.602 --> 00:16:33.703
and the emails that
we've gotten from people,

00:16:33.703 --> 00:16:36.149
and the same on MITx and edX.

00:16:36.149 --> 00:16:39.389
I'm sure you get the same kind
of messages from people who

00:16:39.389 --> 00:16:41.957
could not have dreamed of having access.

00:16:41.957 --> 00:16:44.918
Truth be told, there have been
libraries for a long time,

00:16:44.918 --> 00:16:46.109
and they could get the textbook

00:16:46.109 --> 00:16:47.997
from the libraries if they wanted,

00:16:47.997 --> 00:16:49.263
but this has.

00:16:49.263 --> 00:16:50.848
- [Jack] It's a dynamic
experience that they have.

00:16:50.848 --> 00:16:52.638
- It's a wonderful experience.

00:16:52.638 --> 00:16:54.608
- Let's continue that a little bit

00:16:54.608 --> 00:16:57.810
because I think embedded in
what you're describing is,

00:16:57.810 --> 00:17:00.017
a part of what we do as universities

00:17:00.017 --> 00:17:02.003
is contribute to the public good,

00:17:02.003 --> 00:17:04.667
and the knowledge that's
created is shared.

00:17:04.667 --> 00:17:05.914
We give this out.

00:17:05.914 --> 00:17:07.412
We make it available.

00:17:07.412 --> 00:17:08.819
We share it widely.

00:17:08.819 --> 00:17:12.000
OpenCourseWare and now
edX are different ways

00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:13.654
in which we can make the knowledge

00:17:13.654 --> 00:17:16.283
that's created in our contexts

00:17:16.283 --> 00:17:18.227
more of a public good.

00:17:18.227 --> 00:17:21.379
You mentioned a moment
ago that MIT was created

00:17:21.379 --> 00:17:23.469
to do tech transfer.

00:17:23.469 --> 00:17:27.535
Is there a tension between
our responsibilities

00:17:27.535 --> 00:17:31.523
to create public goods
and the market forces

00:17:31.523 --> 00:17:35.690
that are ever more powerful
in impacting our institutions?

00:17:37.895 --> 00:17:39.978
- Oh, is there a tension?

00:17:41.221 --> 00:17:44.533
A little bit, but not, I would say.

00:17:44.533 --> 00:17:46.723
One of the things that surprised me,

00:17:46.723 --> 00:17:50.085
at Yale there was a lot more
concern about that tension.

00:17:50.085 --> 00:17:51.034
Then I got to MIT.

00:17:51.034 --> 00:17:52.627
I said, what were we worried about?

00:17:52.627 --> 00:17:54.152
This works out just fine

00:17:54.152 --> 00:17:58.210
if you have appropriate
policies and practices.

00:17:58.210 --> 00:18:00.611
So you have to, I mean
obviously, you gotta be careful

00:18:00.611 --> 00:18:02.538
in any of these things that you do.

00:18:02.538 --> 00:18:04.400
You know in this question
of the public good

00:18:04.400 --> 00:18:06.595
I think it's a fascinating question,

00:18:06.595 --> 00:18:09.260
and what it is that we
do in the public good?

00:18:09.260 --> 00:18:11.216
It's what the university does.

00:18:11.216 --> 00:18:14.633
We create new knowledge through research.

00:18:16.339 --> 00:18:18.211
We disseminate new knowledge

00:18:18.211 --> 00:18:20.203
through teaching and publications.

00:18:20.203 --> 00:18:23.695
We preserve knowledge in our collections

00:18:23.695 --> 00:18:26.445
but also frankly in our scholars,

00:18:28.277 --> 00:18:31.983
in the heads of and the
activities of our scholars.

00:18:31.983 --> 00:18:35.788
And these are all to the public good.

00:18:35.788 --> 00:18:38.356
Now there's this marvelous paradox

00:18:38.356 --> 00:18:41.582
that while you're studying
the thing that you love,

00:18:41.582 --> 00:18:43.556
you are creating a public good,

00:18:43.556 --> 00:18:45.387
and that's win win,

00:18:45.387 --> 00:18:48.357
and I think one of the things
that I'm most worried about

00:18:48.357 --> 00:18:51.760
is not that universities
don't contribute sufficiently

00:18:51.760 --> 00:18:54.424
to the public good as universities.

00:18:54.424 --> 00:18:56.387
I frankly am much more worried about

00:18:56.387 --> 00:19:00.842
our societal standards
and our societal norms

00:19:00.842 --> 00:19:03.509
that I think at a perverse level

00:19:04.956 --> 00:19:09.123
encourage people to use
things for their private good.

00:19:10.450 --> 00:19:12.697
And I just described
this marvelous paradox

00:19:12.697 --> 00:19:14.891
that you get private good and public good,

00:19:14.891 --> 00:19:17.891
but I think the pendulum has shifted

00:19:19.801 --> 00:19:22.550
toward a privileging of the private good

00:19:22.550 --> 00:19:23.546
and away from the public good,

00:19:23.546 --> 00:19:26.401
and I don't think that's,

00:19:26.401 --> 00:19:28.131
I don't think that's the university's.

00:19:28.131 --> 00:19:30.051
I think that is a

00:19:30.051 --> 00:19:30.968
huge social

00:19:33.783 --> 00:19:37.673
problem in terms of how
we value what people do

00:19:37.673 --> 00:19:39.773
and who they are that goes well beyond.

00:19:39.773 --> 00:19:44.274
I don't think that the
university is the problem there.

00:19:44.274 --> 00:19:46.701
- Let's take that out a little bit broader

00:19:46.701 --> 00:19:50.066
than just our context in the sense that

00:19:50.066 --> 00:19:53.357
you mentioned the partnership
you've had with Singapore.

00:19:53.357 --> 00:19:55.976
I don't think there's another
university in the world

00:19:55.976 --> 00:20:00.663
that's achieved more global
outreach, a more global network

00:20:00.663 --> 00:20:03.210
than what MIT has been able to do.

00:20:03.210 --> 00:20:07.377
How do you think about
managing knowledge and learning

00:20:08.540 --> 00:20:12.333
and the exchange of
ideas across geographies?

00:20:12.333 --> 00:20:13.166
- Right.

00:20:15.510 --> 00:20:16.343
MIT has,

00:20:19.424 --> 00:20:23.354
has partnerships, in not
a huge number of places,

00:20:23.354 --> 00:20:25.488
small number of places,

00:20:25.488 --> 00:20:27.592
but they're partnerships.

00:20:27.592 --> 00:20:31.987
One of the things again that
I learned when I got to MIT

00:20:31.987 --> 00:20:32.987
is the value

00:20:35.665 --> 00:20:38.881
in having partnerships to build something

00:20:38.881 --> 00:20:42.468
in a place but not setting
up a satellite of MIT.

00:20:42.468 --> 00:20:44.532
So MIT has not satellites.

00:20:44.532 --> 00:20:45.673
We just don't.

00:20:45.673 --> 00:20:49.336
We have a research enterprise in Singapore

00:20:49.336 --> 00:20:50.679
that sits side by side

00:20:50.679 --> 00:20:52.857
with one of our educational activities,

00:20:52.857 --> 00:20:54.204
but MIT is much more interested

00:20:54.204 --> 00:20:56.514
in building capacity for them

00:20:56.514 --> 00:20:58.247
than we are having an MIT site.

00:20:58.247 --> 00:21:00.180
I learned this from the MIT Sloan School,

00:21:00.180 --> 00:21:03.782
our business school, that there
is not an MIT Sloan School

00:21:03.782 --> 00:21:07.596
anywhere else in the world, but
everyone was racing to China

00:21:07.596 --> 00:21:09.372
when I started as president.

00:21:09.372 --> 00:21:11.003
And what Sloan had done
was they established

00:21:11.003 --> 00:21:13.839
these partnerships with four
Chinese business schools

00:21:13.839 --> 00:21:17.577
rather than setting up
MIT Sloan in one place.

00:21:17.577 --> 00:21:20.187
The pattern is to bring faculty

00:21:20.187 --> 00:21:24.717
from those four Chinese
business schools to Sloan,

00:21:24.717 --> 00:21:27.876
have them take the classes,
teach with the faculty,

00:21:27.876 --> 00:21:30.096
establish research collaborations,

00:21:30.096 --> 00:21:32.868
and then go home and
deploy what they learned

00:21:32.868 --> 00:21:35.245
in their home context.

00:21:35.245 --> 00:21:36.838
What do we know about teaching in China?

00:21:36.838 --> 00:21:38.423
Nothing, right?

00:21:38.423 --> 00:21:40.208
But we're happy to share what we know,

00:21:40.208 --> 00:21:41.808
and this is the spirit of OpenCourseWare.

00:21:41.808 --> 00:21:45.241
We are happy to share
what we know with you

00:21:45.241 --> 00:21:47.627
and help you build what
you think is going to be

00:21:47.627 --> 00:21:50.665
the very best school or
institution for your country.

00:21:50.665 --> 00:21:53.940
There's another very interesting thing.

00:21:53.940 --> 00:21:56.892
One of the hard things about establishing,

00:21:56.892 --> 00:22:00.383
excuse me, activities is how do you get

00:22:00.383 --> 00:22:02.150
the faculty to go there.

00:22:02.150 --> 00:22:06.205
Every country wants your
faculty to be teaching there.

00:22:06.205 --> 00:22:07.645
Well that's really hard.

00:22:07.645 --> 00:22:09.935
I want my faculty to be teaching here.

00:22:09.935 --> 00:22:13.941
I want our students to
experience our faculty.

00:22:13.941 --> 00:22:18.033
But what this, I think a
really important element

00:22:18.033 --> 00:22:21.242
is the, you and I have talked about this,

00:22:21.242 --> 00:22:24.909
is the I think inseparable,
inseparable bond

00:22:26.426 --> 00:22:29.579
between education and research.

00:22:29.579 --> 00:22:32.470
And so for some of our faculty,

00:22:32.470 --> 00:22:34.584
they'll go to Singapore because there's

00:22:34.584 --> 00:22:36.406
a new educational opportunity,

00:22:36.406 --> 00:22:38.678
but at MIT frankly not so much.

00:22:38.678 --> 00:22:41.472
They'll go to Singapore if
there's a research opportunity

00:22:41.472 --> 00:22:45.601
that they can't access in
Cambridge, Massachusets.

00:22:45.601 --> 00:22:48.883
And so all of our collaborations

00:22:48.883 --> 00:22:51.461
offered research
opportunities to our faculty

00:22:51.461 --> 00:22:56.274
that you just couldn't do
in Cambridge, Massachusets.

00:22:56.274 --> 00:22:59.367
So Singapore, our programs in Singapore

00:22:59.367 --> 00:23:00.775
are research programs.

00:23:00.775 --> 00:23:02.587
I'll give you one example that you just

00:23:02.587 --> 00:23:03.581
couldn't do in Cambridge.

00:23:03.581 --> 00:23:05.706
So when I arrived opposite
the president's house

00:23:05.706 --> 00:23:07.942
which is right on the Charles River

00:23:07.942 --> 00:23:10.770
is the Sailing Pavilion, and we went out

00:23:10.770 --> 00:23:13.087
to look at the boats and take a boat out,

00:23:13.087 --> 00:23:16.160
and there were people
there with these big yellow

00:23:16.160 --> 00:23:18.234
what looked like torpedoes.

00:23:18.234 --> 00:23:20.143
Whoa, this is a little scary.

00:23:20.143 --> 00:23:24.354
These ended up to be
underwater autonomous vehicles

00:23:24.354 --> 00:23:29.058
that the group who does
ocean engineering at MIT

00:23:29.058 --> 00:23:33.225
was developing and using the
Charles River as the test bed.

00:23:35.099 --> 00:23:36.400
I mean that's cool.

00:23:36.400 --> 00:23:38.141
The Charles River is not so interesting.

00:23:38.141 --> 00:23:41.406
I think it's only seven
feet, eight feet deep,

00:23:41.406 --> 00:23:42.774
and it's pretty flat.

00:23:42.774 --> 00:23:44.119
You know where the boundaries are.

00:23:44.119 --> 00:23:45.499
- [Jack] You can't get hurt.

00:23:45.499 --> 00:23:47.310
- Well if you touch the
bottom you can get hurt

00:23:47.310 --> 00:23:48.630
'cause of the pollutants.

00:23:48.630 --> 00:23:50.095
(laughter)

00:23:50.095 --> 00:23:51.679
It's very hard to get lost.

00:23:51.679 --> 00:23:55.414
Sometimes these UAVs would get
lost, but you can find them.

00:23:55.414 --> 00:23:57.315
It's not a big problem.

00:23:57.315 --> 00:23:59.482
But a good place to start.

00:24:00.428 --> 00:24:03.502
Boston Harbor is a much
more interesting place,

00:24:03.502 --> 00:24:07.669
but you know the powers that
be were not all that interested

00:24:08.724 --> 00:24:12.891
in the MIT faculty running
UAVs in the Boston Harbor,

00:24:14.584 --> 00:24:16.084
but Singapore was.

00:24:17.373 --> 00:24:19.916
So the group developing these UAVs

00:24:19.916 --> 00:24:22.833
has an astonishing research program

00:24:22.833 --> 00:24:26.052
running these UAVs in
the Singapore harbor.

00:24:26.052 --> 00:24:29.433
Very difficult terrain,
fascinating problems,

00:24:29.433 --> 00:24:34.201
real life problems, and so
weren't they excited to do that.

00:24:34.201 --> 00:24:35.412
They get involved.

00:24:35.412 --> 00:24:36.743
They're doing some teaching.

00:24:36.743 --> 00:24:38.602
I mean the whole, it's
research and education

00:24:38.602 --> 00:24:41.508
that's going hand in hand in ways that,

00:24:41.508 --> 00:24:45.675
it's just one of the what's
most marvelous features

00:24:46.680 --> 00:24:48.930
of the research university.

00:24:50.038 --> 00:24:52.265
- This is a framing question for us

00:24:52.265 --> 00:24:54.858
as we wrestle with this
moment in higher education,

00:24:54.858 --> 00:24:59.048
and that is what do we
protect and hold onto,

00:24:59.048 --> 00:25:03.524
and where do we need to
experiment, innovate, adapt

00:25:03.524 --> 00:25:05.275
in some new ways?

00:25:05.275 --> 00:25:08.094
And in some reflections that
I shared with the faculty

00:25:08.094 --> 00:25:12.177
I talked about the sort
of inextricable character

00:25:13.565 --> 00:25:15.629
of the university where we engage

00:25:15.629 --> 00:25:17.285
in the formation of our students,

00:25:17.285 --> 00:25:19.934
provide for the inquiry of our faculty

00:25:19.934 --> 00:25:23.467
and we contribute to the
common good of our communities.

00:25:23.467 --> 00:25:26.800
This, you captured it just a moment ago,

00:25:27.976 --> 00:25:31.646
in the inextricable link
that you just described too.

00:25:31.646 --> 00:25:35.849
What should we be so
rigorous about protecting,

00:25:35.849 --> 00:25:39.256
and where should we be open to innovation?

00:25:39.256 --> 00:25:43.923
- Well, the fact is in this
research education nexus

00:25:43.923 --> 00:25:47.173
it is just chockablock with innovation.

00:25:48.181 --> 00:25:49.766
So universities are criticized.

00:25:49.766 --> 00:25:52.239
There are ways we should
probably change more rapidly.

00:25:52.239 --> 00:25:55.805
The fact is, we change
really rapidly in ways

00:25:55.805 --> 00:25:57.385
that people just kind of don't ignore

00:25:57.385 --> 00:25:59.191
because the buildings are old.

00:25:59.191 --> 00:26:00.740
We got lecture rooms,

00:26:00.740 --> 00:26:03.206
but what's being taught
in the lecture rooms

00:26:03.206 --> 00:26:06.718
is very different from what
was being taught 25 years ago.

00:26:06.718 --> 00:26:09.239
Most of the people I
know who are in positions

00:26:09.239 --> 00:26:11.940
of academic leadership
have degrees in fields

00:26:11.940 --> 00:26:15.851
that didn't exist 20 years
before they got those degrees.

00:26:15.851 --> 00:26:17.627
How does that happen so fast?

00:26:17.627 --> 00:26:21.359
In our research domain
we are always changing

00:26:21.359 --> 00:26:23.784
as fast as possible.

00:26:23.784 --> 00:26:26.339
In fact sometimes we
get the direction wrong.

00:26:26.339 --> 00:26:28.161
Over time it will correct.

00:26:28.161 --> 00:26:32.036
I certainly wouldn't
necessarily be able to say

00:26:32.036 --> 00:26:33.473
what direction was right or wrong

00:26:33.473 --> 00:26:34.544
for an architecture department.

00:26:34.544 --> 00:26:35.594
How would I know?

00:26:35.594 --> 00:26:36.599
I'm a neuroscientist.

00:26:36.599 --> 00:26:37.626
At this point, I can't even tell

00:26:37.626 --> 00:26:39.129
for a neuroscience department

00:26:39.129 --> 00:26:40.281
what direction is right or wrong

00:26:40.281 --> 00:26:43.377
because I've been away from the frontier.

00:26:43.377 --> 00:26:47.210
So the things I think
we need to protect, I am

00:26:49.795 --> 00:26:50.628
so in awe

00:26:52.427 --> 00:26:56.177
of what you brilliantly
capture as formation.

00:26:57.974 --> 00:27:00.641
Young people come to our campus,

00:27:02.229 --> 00:27:04.312
and they have experiences

00:27:05.551 --> 00:27:08.408
that in very important ways

00:27:08.408 --> 00:27:11.410
allow them to become who they will be.

00:27:11.410 --> 00:27:13.821
We don't know who that is.

00:27:13.821 --> 00:27:17.988
Our faculty come to our
campuses with a research program

00:27:19.305 --> 00:27:21.861
and some idea of what they
think they might want to do

00:27:21.861 --> 00:27:25.212
but with no real idea of
where they're going to be,

00:27:25.212 --> 00:27:28.462
and so we have to preserve this kind of

00:27:30.011 --> 00:27:32.844
open ended approach to the future.

00:27:35.433 --> 00:27:37.933
As we mentioned before we came in,

00:27:37.933 --> 00:27:42.474
I'm a big fan of all of this
online digital education

00:27:42.474 --> 00:27:44.756
that provides resources for
people around the world,

00:27:44.756 --> 00:27:48.011
but it's only a piece of what we do.

00:27:48.011 --> 00:27:51.694
Whether it will be able
to evolve as rapidly

00:27:51.694 --> 00:27:53.193
as a classroom evolves,

00:27:53.193 --> 00:27:54.443
you know it's very expensive to get

00:27:54.443 --> 00:27:58.042
these courses online, as you know.

00:27:58.042 --> 00:28:00.500
Will we be able to change them every year,

00:28:00.500 --> 00:28:02.926
every two years, every five years?

00:28:02.926 --> 00:28:04.935
Will we be able to,

00:28:04.935 --> 00:28:08.518
will the online world
have greater alacrity

00:28:10.460 --> 00:28:14.340
than we've had in the in
person lecture room world?

00:28:14.340 --> 00:28:15.658
I don't know,

00:28:15.658 --> 00:28:18.584
but I think this business
of being in formation

00:28:18.584 --> 00:28:21.001
is the thing that we do best,

00:28:22.161 --> 00:28:26.734
and the thing that happens,
and then we preserve best,

00:28:26.734 --> 00:28:31.057
and understanding what that
is, defining what that is

00:28:31.057 --> 00:28:33.022
has to be what the university continues

00:28:33.022 --> 00:28:35.615
to deliver to the world.

00:28:35.615 --> 00:28:36.841
- Let's open this up.

00:28:36.841 --> 00:28:41.196
We've got some time for
questions form the audience.

00:28:41.196 --> 00:28:42.446
I think we have

00:28:44.603 --> 00:28:45.935
microphones.

00:28:45.935 --> 00:28:49.199
The problem I have is I can't
see a single human being here.

00:28:49.199 --> 00:28:50.782
- Can't see a hand.

00:28:53.787 --> 00:28:55.834
- Please introduce yourselves.

00:28:55.834 --> 00:28:57.859
- [Norman] I'm an emeritus professor.

00:28:57.859 --> 00:29:00.239
- I know that voice.

00:29:00.239 --> 00:29:03.508
- [Norman] I'm an emeritus
professor but also a human being.

00:29:03.508 --> 00:29:05.675
- This is Norman Birnbaum.

00:29:07.637 --> 00:29:10.373
- [Norman] If a senior academic citizen

00:29:10.373 --> 00:29:13.040
can be permitted a reminiscence,

00:29:14.080 --> 00:29:17.152
when I was a graduate student
in sociology at Harvard,

00:29:17.152 --> 00:29:20.283
I had the great good
fortune to participate

00:29:20.283 --> 00:29:24.088
in the first round of
general education courses,

00:29:24.088 --> 00:29:26.700
and I had an age mate, a colleague,

00:29:26.700 --> 00:29:29.285
who was a graduate student in physics,

00:29:29.285 --> 00:29:31.724
and he was teaching in James Conan's

00:29:31.724 --> 00:29:33.988
science for non-scientists,

00:29:33.988 --> 00:29:37.408
and he complained to me
that his teachers in physics

00:29:37.408 --> 00:29:39.674
were continually harassing him

00:29:39.674 --> 00:29:42.450
to drop that kind of stuff, no use,

00:29:42.450 --> 00:29:44.629
get back into the laboratory.

00:29:44.629 --> 00:29:46.712
His name was Thomas Cume.

00:29:48.364 --> 00:29:51.795
The interesting question is whether

00:29:51.795 --> 00:29:54.388
the sciences in the sciences today,

00:29:54.388 --> 00:29:57.002
and MIT I know has a
very strong liberal arts

00:29:57.002 --> 00:29:59.152
and social sciences component,

00:29:59.152 --> 00:30:03.319
whether in the education
of science of scientists,

00:30:04.360 --> 00:30:08.981
these larger philosophical
moral and historical questions

00:30:08.981 --> 00:30:09.981
play a role.

00:30:11.769 --> 00:30:14.348
- It's a great and I think
a very important question.

00:30:14.348 --> 00:30:18.515
The MIT curriculum is
actually a little antediluvian

00:30:20.014 --> 00:30:21.749
in that we have a core.

00:30:21.749 --> 00:30:23.194
We have a core curriculum.

00:30:23.194 --> 00:30:27.713
Every student takes six
prescribed science courses.

00:30:27.713 --> 00:30:29.217
You take or pass out of them.

00:30:29.217 --> 00:30:30.212
AP doesn't count.

00:30:30.212 --> 00:30:32.301
You gotta actually pass
out of the material,

00:30:32.301 --> 00:30:34.964
but every MIT student
has to take eight courses

00:30:34.964 --> 00:30:37.270
in the humanities, arts,
and social sciences,

00:30:37.270 --> 00:30:40.989
and so your question to me
is not whether it's important

00:30:40.989 --> 00:30:43.222
to engage the great philosophic, ethical,

00:30:43.222 --> 00:30:44.961
moral issues of the day.

00:30:44.961 --> 00:30:46.953
I think we need to.

00:30:46.953 --> 00:30:49.628
But where does that happen?

00:30:49.628 --> 00:30:53.842
And to require physicists to do that work,

00:30:53.842 --> 00:30:56.718
some physicists should be involved

00:30:56.718 --> 00:30:58.868
is kind of one approach,

00:30:58.868 --> 00:31:02.561
or is it the faculty in
the philosophy department

00:31:02.561 --> 00:31:04.180
who should be doing that work?

00:31:04.180 --> 00:31:08.349
And my answer actually is
how do we create structures

00:31:08.349 --> 00:31:10.389
that allow physicists and philosophers

00:31:10.389 --> 00:31:14.444
to actually have conversations that can,

00:31:14.444 --> 00:31:15.875
in those conversations we don't know

00:31:15.875 --> 00:31:17.179
what the answers are of course,

00:31:17.179 --> 00:31:19.414
but provide the context
for educating our students

00:31:19.414 --> 00:31:21.140
to pay attention to these things.

00:31:21.140 --> 00:31:24.371
How do we give our students
the foundational knowledge

00:31:24.371 --> 00:31:27.906
so that they can understand
the importance of the questions

00:31:27.906 --> 00:31:29.496
and participate in conversations

00:31:29.496 --> 00:31:31.546
in searching for the answers?

00:31:31.546 --> 00:31:33.772
I think this is absolutely essential

00:31:33.772 --> 00:31:34.772
and I'm now,

00:31:36.474 --> 00:31:38.487
Yale is not antediluvian

00:31:38.487 --> 00:31:41.082
in its requirements for undergraduates,

00:31:41.082 --> 00:31:45.592
and I have shifted to
frankly the belief that

00:31:45.592 --> 00:31:48.326
giving our students better direction

00:31:48.326 --> 00:31:50.910
about what they will need

00:31:50.910 --> 00:31:52.494
would be better for them

00:31:52.494 --> 00:31:54.691
than the direction that
many universities have gone

00:31:54.691 --> 00:31:56.516
which is whatever the
heck you want is fine.

00:31:56.516 --> 00:31:57.965
You make up your own world.

00:31:57.965 --> 00:32:00.965
I think that for a number of reasons

00:32:02.744 --> 00:32:04.635
a core curricula are great.

00:32:04.635 --> 00:32:06.002
Something I didn't know,

00:32:06.002 --> 00:32:07.602
it took me a couple
years to understand this

00:32:07.602 --> 00:32:08.934
of course having come out of a school

00:32:08.934 --> 00:32:11.478
where there wasn't a core.

00:32:11.478 --> 00:32:14.127
When I arrived at MIT I asked in my effort

00:32:14.127 --> 00:32:15.903
to learn about the place
I would ask the students,

00:32:15.903 --> 00:32:18.006
what do you love most about MIT?

00:32:18.006 --> 00:32:20.596
And the most frequent
answer was I just love it

00:32:20.596 --> 00:32:23.330
that everyone is so smart.

00:32:23.330 --> 00:32:26.622
You know, great answer,
but I had been to a place

00:32:26.622 --> 00:32:28.659
where everyone was really smart too,

00:32:28.659 --> 00:32:30.627
but they never said that.

00:32:30.627 --> 00:32:32.877
But what I realized is that

00:32:35.624 --> 00:32:39.791
the having a core curriculum,
the six science courses,

00:32:40.876 --> 00:32:44.459
gives all MIT students
a common vocabulary.

00:32:45.796 --> 00:32:48.979
So they can have conversations with anyone

00:32:48.979 --> 00:32:50.837
whether after the six science courses

00:32:50.837 --> 00:32:54.504
you're studying
architecture or chemistry or

00:32:56.634 --> 00:33:00.677
mechanical engineering,
doesn't make any difference

00:33:00.677 --> 00:33:02.993
because you have a way of
communicating with one another

00:33:02.993 --> 00:33:05.586
so you know that someone is smart.

00:33:05.586 --> 00:33:09.453
At Yale, if you're majoring
in comparative literature

00:33:09.453 --> 00:33:12.306
or chemistry, you don't
know where even to start

00:33:12.306 --> 00:33:13.999
the conversation because you don't have

00:33:13.999 --> 00:33:15.976
the assurance that someone has

00:33:15.976 --> 00:33:17.561
the same set of knowledge.

00:33:17.561 --> 00:33:19.816
So I think that's a kind of a side product

00:33:19.816 --> 00:33:21.294
of a core curriculum,

00:33:21.294 --> 00:33:23.757
but I think directionally I
think it's just very important

00:33:23.757 --> 00:33:26.103
for us to provide our students
frankly with more guidance

00:33:26.103 --> 00:33:29.181
than less guidance in terms
of what is fundamental

00:33:29.181 --> 00:33:31.848
to the life they will be living.

00:33:32.986 --> 00:33:34.314
- [Jack] Thank you.

00:33:34.314 --> 00:33:36.712
If you come to the microphones
we can see the microphones,

00:33:36.712 --> 00:33:38.251
so please introduce yourself.

00:33:38.251 --> 00:33:39.933
- [Alex] Hi, I'm Alex.

00:33:39.933 --> 00:33:41.761
I'm a senior at Georgetown University,

00:33:41.761 --> 00:33:44.231
and I'm currently working with a course

00:33:44.231 --> 00:33:47.523
that is attempting to
envision what a school

00:33:47.523 --> 00:33:50.675
like Georgetown will be like in 20 years.

00:33:50.675 --> 00:33:52.758
You mention that there is

00:33:53.653 --> 00:33:57.170
constant change within
individual classrooms.

00:33:57.170 --> 00:34:00.096
I would love to pick your
brain about how you can see

00:34:00.096 --> 00:34:04.476
a general shift in thinking
from entire student bodies

00:34:04.476 --> 00:34:07.489
and faculty and even administrators
20 years in the future

00:34:07.489 --> 00:34:09.709
or maybe 10 years in the future.

00:34:09.709 --> 00:34:11.938
- The future is kind of fuzzy.

00:34:11.938 --> 00:34:13.488
I always say is five years out

00:34:13.488 --> 00:34:15.047
I can see it with some clarity.

00:34:15.047 --> 00:34:18.242
After that it gets really
fuzzy and out of focus.

00:34:18.242 --> 00:34:20.409
I think the most important

00:34:22.125 --> 00:34:26.128
thing in terms of taking care
of what's 20 years from now

00:34:26.128 --> 00:34:28.792
is these practices of the mind,

00:34:28.792 --> 00:34:32.959
the practices of the university
that we have to preserve,

00:34:33.939 --> 00:34:35.881
and this is what the president was asking.

00:34:35.881 --> 00:34:38.485
What must we not lose?

00:34:38.485 --> 00:34:41.985
We must not lose, or what must we amplify?

00:34:43.193 --> 00:34:46.108
Any way to encourage faculty

00:34:46.108 --> 00:34:48.356
to think anew about their subjects,

00:34:48.356 --> 00:34:50.909
give them opportunities
to teach in new ways.

00:34:50.909 --> 00:34:53.088
Some of them will pick them
up, some of them won't,

00:34:53.088 --> 00:34:56.836
but just to create a culture
or maintain a culture,

00:34:56.836 --> 00:35:00.458
amplify the culture of
discovery and innovation

00:35:00.458 --> 00:35:02.731
both in teaching and in research.

00:35:02.731 --> 00:35:04.859
Kind of take off the shackles.

00:35:04.859 --> 00:35:09.108
That's what's most important
because I can't say

00:35:09.108 --> 00:35:10.528
where chemistry is going to be,

00:35:10.528 --> 00:35:12.443
how chemistry is going
to be taught in 20 years.

00:35:12.443 --> 00:35:13.932
There's no way for me to know that.

00:35:13.932 --> 00:35:16.432
But what I do know is bringing

00:35:17.363 --> 00:35:20.219
the best faculty to the campus

00:35:20.219 --> 00:35:22.561
and bringing the best
students to a campus,

00:35:22.561 --> 00:35:24.771
and I'll come back to what best means,

00:35:24.771 --> 00:35:27.434
is absolutely the first
thing you've gotta do

00:35:27.434 --> 00:35:29.667
in order to assure your future.

00:35:29.667 --> 00:35:31.718
Now best is an interesting question

00:35:31.718 --> 00:35:34.186
because best is not the same everywhere,

00:35:34.186 --> 00:35:36.013
and I'm a big believer,

00:35:36.013 --> 00:35:38.357
it was really enforcing,
you'll have this joy soon,

00:35:38.357 --> 00:35:40.185
when we did college
visits, and my daughter

00:35:40.185 --> 00:35:41.785
is a senior in college,

00:35:41.785 --> 00:35:46.288
but it was so fun to go
on these college tours.

00:35:46.288 --> 00:35:50.304
Happily I was able to do
most of these anonymously,

00:35:50.304 --> 00:35:53.042
and my daughter was a
little impatient with me

00:35:53.042 --> 00:35:55.203
because I was like taking
notes everywhere I went.

00:35:55.203 --> 00:35:56.990
Oh this is so interesting.

00:35:56.990 --> 00:35:59.582
Trying not to be the person
who asked the most questions.

00:35:59.582 --> 00:36:02.799
It was just a stealth mission
for how to make MIT better.

00:36:02.799 --> 00:36:04.070
(laughter)

00:36:04.070 --> 00:36:05.437
But the thing that impressed me again

00:36:05.437 --> 00:36:07.706
was every campus was different.

00:36:07.706 --> 00:36:09.686
Every campus has its own personality.

00:36:09.686 --> 00:36:11.834
Every campus weights different subjects

00:36:11.834 --> 00:36:14.005
and different activities
and different experiences

00:36:14.005 --> 00:36:15.066
in different ways.

00:36:15.066 --> 00:36:16.922
So what's best for one campus

00:36:16.922 --> 00:36:18.784
is not going to best for another campus,

00:36:18.784 --> 00:36:22.295
and so I think understanding
what a campus's strengths are

00:36:22.295 --> 00:36:25.130
and how you amplify on
that through understanding

00:36:25.130 --> 00:36:27.275
what other schools are
doing and not mimicking it

00:36:27.275 --> 00:36:30.349
but using that knowledge to get better.

00:36:30.349 --> 00:36:34.154
Best for a campus is
where the match between

00:36:34.154 --> 00:36:35.945
who the students are and
what their ambition is

00:36:35.945 --> 00:36:37.994
and who the faculty are
and what their ambition is

00:36:37.994 --> 00:36:39.797
is really what creates the magic

00:36:39.797 --> 00:36:41.920
because then you have communities

00:36:41.920 --> 00:36:43.454
that can talk to one another

00:36:43.454 --> 00:36:46.097
and will invent a future that's just

00:36:46.097 --> 00:36:48.470
better than the present.

00:36:48.470 --> 00:36:51.569
- And if I could just brag on your behalf,

00:36:51.569 --> 00:36:53.439
your daughter did find a good match

00:36:53.439 --> 00:36:58.405
because some of you may know
at the end of last semester

00:36:58.405 --> 00:37:00.294
Professor Hockfield's
daughter was selected

00:37:00.294 --> 00:37:03.960
as one of the 32 American
Rhodes Scholars for this class.

00:37:03.960 --> 00:37:06.210
(applause)

00:37:08.275 --> 00:37:09.626
Please introduce yourself.

00:37:09.626 --> 00:37:11.534
- Hello Dr. Hockfield
and President DeGioia.

00:37:11.534 --> 00:37:14.339
My name is Bebe Albornoz, and
I'm a senior in the college

00:37:14.339 --> 00:37:16.887
studying English and philosophy.

00:37:16.887 --> 00:37:20.113
Sort of on the note of
maintaining and preserving

00:37:20.113 --> 00:37:22.838
the personality or the sort
of dimensions and the nature

00:37:22.838 --> 00:37:24.588
of each university.

00:37:24.588 --> 00:37:26.666
Here at Georgetown, for example,

00:37:26.666 --> 00:37:28.933
we have such a rich Jesuit tradition

00:37:28.933 --> 00:37:32.016
that we're steeped in and
those kinds of values.

00:37:32.016 --> 00:37:34.418
I think in thinking of
modernity and research

00:37:34.418 --> 00:37:37.658
and progression we can
still maintain an anchor

00:37:37.658 --> 00:37:41.629
by tying that to the traditions
that where we started from.

00:37:41.629 --> 00:37:44.282
You mentioned that some of
these higher education schools

00:37:44.282 --> 00:37:46.322
started as divinity schools.

00:37:46.322 --> 00:37:48.838
So I'm wondering if you
could touch a bit more

00:37:48.838 --> 00:37:51.590
on how we can work with
the idea of modernity

00:37:51.590 --> 00:37:53.162
that remains anchored to some kind

00:37:53.162 --> 00:37:55.262
of traditional values as well.

00:37:55.262 --> 00:37:58.345
- Yeah so I'm a huge fan of the past,

00:37:59.366 --> 00:38:01.369
as much as I am a fan of the future,

00:38:01.369 --> 00:38:05.536
and I think just in terms of
the balance on our campuses,

00:38:07.499 --> 00:38:09.835
things swing not just back
and forth, back and forth,

00:38:09.835 --> 00:38:11.907
and side to side, and
all kinds of directions.

00:38:11.907 --> 00:38:13.407
I think one of the

00:38:14.785 --> 00:38:17.535
important roles of the university

00:38:19.031 --> 00:38:21.960
is the preservation of knowledge.

00:38:21.960 --> 00:38:23.710
I said the preservation
of knowledge happens

00:38:23.710 --> 00:38:25.788
not just in our collections

00:38:25.788 --> 00:38:27.788
but also in our faculty.

00:38:31.303 --> 00:38:34.103
While particular disciplines

00:38:34.103 --> 00:38:37.328
may not be the height of fashion,

00:38:37.328 --> 00:38:39.271
it's very important for universities

00:38:39.271 --> 00:38:44.206
to try their best to preserve
those academic traditions,

00:38:44.206 --> 00:38:48.373
and I am a big fan of 2000
years ago, 4000 years ago,

00:38:50.459 --> 00:38:53.209
and having that be the foundation

00:38:54.864 --> 00:38:57.205
of where the future is going to be,

00:38:57.205 --> 00:38:59.593
and I just, I mean I guess
I can say this kind of thing

00:38:59.593 --> 00:39:01.247
because I'm not president anymore.

00:39:01.247 --> 00:39:03.301
I just think we are neglecting

00:39:03.301 --> 00:39:05.581
the past too much these days,

00:39:05.581 --> 00:39:08.039
and so I would only encourage Georgetown

00:39:08.039 --> 00:39:10.608
to continue to be well anchored,

00:39:10.608 --> 00:39:13.286
well rooted in the past.

00:39:13.286 --> 00:39:16.693
We like to think of people who lived

00:39:16.693 --> 00:39:19.946
a thousand years ago as somehow stupid.

00:39:19.946 --> 00:39:21.927
No, they were actually,

00:39:21.927 --> 00:39:25.346
our brains have not changed
very much let's just say.

00:39:25.346 --> 00:39:27.631
We've added a lot of data,

00:39:27.631 --> 00:39:29.964
but there is just tremendous

00:39:30.997 --> 00:39:35.164
interest, knowledge, wisdom
in studies of the past.

00:39:36.606 --> 00:39:38.916
- [Jack] Please introduce yourself.

00:39:38.916 --> 00:39:40.301
- [Irene] Irene Jillson, professor

00:39:40.301 --> 00:39:43.488
of the School of Nursing
and Health Studies,

00:39:43.488 --> 00:39:46.332
and given our interest in a
cross-campus collaboration

00:39:46.332 --> 00:39:48.325
I also teach in the School of Medicine

00:39:48.325 --> 00:39:50.809
and School of Foreign Service.

00:39:50.809 --> 00:39:52.059
You spoke about

00:39:53.559 --> 00:39:55.748
engagement in partnerships

00:39:55.748 --> 00:39:59.414
with other countries and
research and education,

00:39:59.414 --> 00:40:01.704
and I wonder if you
could speak specifically

00:40:01.704 --> 00:40:04.717
to the role that you believe universities

00:40:04.717 --> 00:40:07.217
can play in science diplomacy,

00:40:08.052 --> 00:40:11.753
specifically in engaging with countries

00:40:11.753 --> 00:40:15.388
that are not with which we do not normally

00:40:15.388 --> 00:40:18.761
have positive relationships
or very strong relationships

00:40:18.761 --> 00:40:20.788
so to do it in a proactive way.

00:40:20.788 --> 00:40:23.479
- Yeah really really important question,

00:40:23.479 --> 00:40:25.005
and I wouldn't call it science diplomacy.

00:40:25.005 --> 00:40:28.983
I call it academic diplomacy,
an incredibly powerful tool.

00:40:28.983 --> 00:40:31.683
So one of the things
that we don't talk about

00:40:31.683 --> 00:40:34.383
when we think about what
America's doing around the world.

00:40:34.383 --> 00:40:37.118
What we've done is brought
people from all over the world

00:40:37.118 --> 00:40:39.582
to the United States for
some piece of their education

00:40:39.582 --> 00:40:43.096
whether it's six months or
twelve months or six years.

00:40:43.096 --> 00:40:47.096
They then go home with a
wonderful understanding

00:40:48.364 --> 00:40:50.884
of how we do things here.

00:40:50.884 --> 00:40:52.634
Some of it is adopted, some not.

00:40:52.634 --> 00:40:54.837
It is the most powerful form of diplomacy,

00:40:54.837 --> 00:40:57.928
and basically good feelings, usually.

00:40:57.928 --> 00:41:00.819
Similarly, sending
Americans around the world

00:41:00.819 --> 00:41:05.352
to study, to do research,
to engage in local projects

00:41:05.352 --> 00:41:06.694
is very important.

00:41:06.694 --> 00:41:09.361
So I think it's really critical,

00:41:11.423 --> 00:41:12.947
and if I had a magic wand

00:41:12.947 --> 00:41:14.338
to tell Washington what to do,

00:41:14.338 --> 00:41:16.508
I would say put another billion dollars

00:41:16.508 --> 00:41:18.502
into student exchanges.

00:41:18.502 --> 00:41:21.505
There is no better way to
secure a peace in our future

00:41:21.505 --> 00:41:23.255
than to increase this

00:41:25.222 --> 00:41:29.026
travel between US and other countries.

00:41:29.026 --> 00:41:32.842
MIT a couple years ago decided to engage

00:41:32.842 --> 00:41:34.870
in one of these collaborations,

00:41:34.870 --> 00:41:38.660
capacity building in Russia in Skolkovo,

00:41:38.660 --> 00:41:41.660
the kind of imagine a techno center,

00:41:42.742 --> 00:41:44.902
techno city just outside of Moscow,

00:41:44.902 --> 00:41:47.002
and that was a hard decision for us

00:41:47.002 --> 00:41:49.126
for all kinds of political reasons.

00:41:49.126 --> 00:41:52.182
Frankly when MIT decided to
get involved with Singapore

00:41:52.182 --> 00:41:53.782
was before I was president,

00:41:53.782 --> 00:41:55.213
and there was a lot of concern

00:41:55.213 --> 00:41:57.590
because Singapore had a lot of policies

00:41:57.590 --> 00:41:59.505
that were just pretty distasteful,

00:41:59.505 --> 00:42:00.755
but our view is

00:42:02.653 --> 00:42:06.198
if we can get involved, there is a chance

00:42:06.198 --> 00:42:08.381
that we can influence the direction

00:42:08.381 --> 00:42:10.470
of the country's evolution,

00:42:10.470 --> 00:42:14.387
and maybe not, but it's
a wonderful way to try.

00:42:15.716 --> 00:42:17.753
If we're going to wait for countries

00:42:17.753 --> 00:42:20.705
to be just like the United
States before we get involved,

00:42:20.705 --> 00:42:22.599
we'll never be involved anywhere.

00:42:22.599 --> 00:42:26.739
I think getting the voice, not to say that

00:42:26.739 --> 00:42:29.082
MIT or the United States
is going to dictate

00:42:29.082 --> 00:42:33.355
what Singapore becomes,
but to be a presence there

00:42:33.355 --> 00:42:37.438
and to have, we can
basically by walking the talk

00:42:38.587 --> 00:42:40.938
by showing them how we do things

00:42:40.938 --> 00:42:43.326
to influence the way the country evolves

00:42:43.326 --> 00:42:47.367
I think is a very important contribution,

00:42:47.367 --> 00:42:49.649
important effort, and we're
not always successful,

00:42:49.649 --> 00:42:53.139
but I think we've decided, MIT has decided

00:42:53.139 --> 00:42:55.305
to get involved in a
lot of difficult places

00:42:55.305 --> 00:42:58.071
before it was going to be very comfortable

00:42:58.071 --> 00:43:00.378
or even very friendly.

00:43:00.378 --> 00:43:01.240
- [Irene] And fortunately
the Department of State

00:43:01.240 --> 00:43:02.506
supports some of this.

00:43:02.506 --> 00:43:03.359
- Yes.

00:43:03.359 --> 00:43:05.727
- [Irene] So Georgetown has had projects

00:43:05.727 --> 00:43:08.914
with the Department of
State vis-à-vis Iran

00:43:08.914 --> 00:43:11.457
in areas as diverse as
bioethics and science.

00:43:11.457 --> 00:43:12.604
This is important.

00:43:12.604 --> 00:43:13.437
Thank you.

00:43:13.437 --> 00:43:15.179
- But they're complicated,
and this is not to say

00:43:15.179 --> 00:43:17.087
it's not a headache for the president.

00:43:17.087 --> 00:43:18.010
It can be.

00:43:18.010 --> 00:43:19.691
(laughter)

00:43:19.691 --> 00:43:20.608
- [Jack] Please.

00:43:20.608 --> 00:43:21.608
- [Kent] Hi.

00:43:23.508 --> 00:43:25.083
Hi, I'm Kent Carlson.

00:43:25.083 --> 00:43:27.531
I'm a senior in the SFS.

00:43:27.531 --> 00:43:28.628
- SFS, sorry?

00:43:28.628 --> 00:43:29.951
- [Together] School of Foreign Service.

00:43:29.951 --> 00:43:31.784
- Thank you very much.

00:43:32.857 --> 00:43:36.012
- [Kent] I want to go back
to talking about tradition

00:43:36.012 --> 00:43:38.188
a little bit and sort of how

00:43:38.188 --> 00:43:41.367
we not only talk about it
within a university setting

00:43:41.367 --> 00:43:43.367
but also with the nation

00:43:46.069 --> 00:43:48.507
because I think it's
there can be a lot of talk

00:43:48.507 --> 00:43:50.405
at a university about

00:43:50.405 --> 00:43:53.497
where our values come from
and how it's important

00:43:53.497 --> 00:43:57.124
to preserve them and how we
think that they're important,

00:43:57.124 --> 00:43:59.731
but a lot of the changes going on

00:43:59.731 --> 00:44:03.231
are outside forces on the university.

00:44:03.231 --> 00:44:04.921
What do you think is
the university's role,

00:44:04.921 --> 00:44:07.191
and how do you think the university

00:44:07.191 --> 00:44:10.588
can go about convincing
the rest of the world

00:44:10.588 --> 00:44:13.838
that this tradition, these past values,

00:44:15.326 --> 00:44:17.848
these disciplines that
aren't necessarily in fashion

00:44:17.848 --> 00:44:22.015
still have value in the greater
context of higher education?

00:44:23.990 --> 00:44:27.073
- A difficult but very good question,

00:44:28.324 --> 00:44:30.867
and I think that one of the things

00:44:30.867 --> 00:44:34.465
that certainly in my field we didn't pay

00:44:34.465 --> 00:44:38.132
a lot of attention to
in neuroscience until,

00:44:40.348 --> 00:44:42.807
I had already established my lab,

00:44:42.807 --> 00:44:46.474
and all of a sudden
there was a big pressure

00:44:48.061 --> 00:44:51.806
to be public spokespeople for what we did,

00:44:51.806 --> 00:44:54.595
and it's part of the public good.

00:44:54.595 --> 00:44:57.512
So universities are not monasteries

00:44:58.913 --> 00:45:02.360
that are live into and of themselves.

00:45:02.360 --> 00:45:05.841
I think that each of us needs to

00:45:05.841 --> 00:45:09.202
make a serious effort to
communicate what we do

00:45:09.202 --> 00:45:10.738
to the rest of the world in ways

00:45:10.738 --> 00:45:12.320
that they can understand it,

00:45:12.320 --> 00:45:16.459
and I think to make the
argument that it matters

00:45:16.459 --> 00:45:20.025
whatever you're studying, is
part of the responsibility,

00:45:20.025 --> 00:45:22.615
and it's part of our
commitment to the public good

00:45:22.615 --> 00:45:25.364
is helping people
understand why it matters.

00:45:25.364 --> 00:45:28.858
Why should people care about
the thing that we're studying?

00:45:28.858 --> 00:45:30.199
So that's part of it.

00:45:30.199 --> 00:45:31.845
I want to just add a
little kind of footnote

00:45:31.845 --> 00:45:34.178
about tradition and culture.

00:45:37.101 --> 00:45:38.601
It's not all good.

00:45:40.169 --> 00:45:43.336
It is a difficult conversation to have

00:45:45.489 --> 00:45:48.333
deciding what part of the culture,

00:45:48.333 --> 00:45:52.617
what part of tradition
it's time to leave behind,

00:45:52.617 --> 00:45:56.504
and we don't want to
be trapped in the past.

00:45:56.504 --> 00:45:59.709
We don't want to look
and act and be exactly

00:45:59.709 --> 00:46:03.345
the way we were 5 years,
10 years, 50 years go.

00:46:03.345 --> 00:46:07.221
But it is a very very, I have
to say a tricky negotiation,

00:46:07.221 --> 00:46:10.485
a tricky decision making to decide

00:46:10.485 --> 00:46:12.148
we've just gotta let this stuff go

00:46:12.148 --> 00:46:16.077
because it's preventing
us from moving forward.

00:46:16.077 --> 00:46:17.925
These are tough
discussions at universities

00:46:17.925 --> 00:46:20.337
that are steeped in tradition,

00:46:20.337 --> 00:46:24.165
but at some point, there are
departments that go away.

00:46:24.165 --> 00:46:26.023
Tough decisions but
decisions that absolutely

00:46:26.023 --> 00:46:28.461
have to be taken because the
universities are criticized

00:46:28.461 --> 00:46:31.578
often of being able to
add but not subtract,

00:46:31.578 --> 00:46:36.150
and for a lot of reasons
the physical constraints

00:46:36.150 --> 00:46:40.317
of space and dollars prevent
us from simply adding.

00:46:41.425 --> 00:46:44.383
So I think this understanding

00:46:44.383 --> 00:46:48.050
not what the performance
of the tradition is

00:46:50.475 --> 00:46:53.642
and that you adhere to that mindlessly

00:46:55.960 --> 00:46:56.960
but what the

00:46:58.035 --> 00:47:02.971
core belief the foundational
value of our tradition is

00:47:02.971 --> 00:47:05.304
and figuring out how to keep that,

00:47:05.304 --> 00:47:09.841
and perhaps following the
spirit of the tradition

00:47:09.841 --> 00:47:12.038
rather than the letter of the tradition.

00:47:12.038 --> 00:47:14.484
But you all understand that debate

00:47:14.484 --> 00:47:16.764
better than most I would say.

00:47:16.764 --> 00:47:17.916
- [Jack] Thank you.

00:47:17.916 --> 00:47:19.455
Please.

00:47:19.455 --> 00:47:20.589
- [Bill] My name is Bill Kunsak.

00:47:20.589 --> 00:47:22.905
I'm a retired lawyer, and
I'm here at Georgetown

00:47:22.905 --> 00:47:25.125
as a student actually in the
very wonderful graduate level

00:47:25.125 --> 00:47:28.166
studies program who we have
here shout out for that.

00:47:28.166 --> 00:47:29.804
So I'm attempting to get a master's degree

00:47:29.804 --> 00:47:30.705
in liberal arts right now.

00:47:30.705 --> 00:47:31.955
- Good for you.

00:47:31.955 --> 00:47:32.825
- [Bill] This is a question

00:47:32.825 --> 00:47:34.715
that I actually heard some years ago

00:47:34.715 --> 00:47:37.449
in a meeting like this with
another university president,

00:47:37.449 --> 00:47:38.901
and I thought it was very good,

00:47:38.901 --> 00:47:40.697
and I thought it provided
some insights to the future,

00:47:40.697 --> 00:47:43.422
so I'd like to ask it to both of you

00:47:43.422 --> 00:47:46.627
what is the single specific thing that

00:47:46.627 --> 00:47:49.460
in your case kept you up at night,

00:47:50.432 --> 00:47:52.993
and your case keeps you up at night

00:47:52.993 --> 00:47:54.672
in this job that you have?

00:47:54.672 --> 00:47:55.583
- Go ahead.

00:47:55.583 --> 00:47:57.833
(laughter)

00:48:02.326 --> 00:48:04.546
- We had a wonderful event the other night

00:48:04.546 --> 00:48:05.899
at an alum's house

00:48:05.899 --> 00:48:09.755
who has been at the
heart of the tech sector

00:48:09.755 --> 00:48:11.146
from the very beginning.

00:48:11.146 --> 00:48:13.170
He's currently chair of Groupon.

00:48:13.170 --> 00:48:15.930
He was one of the leaders
of America Online.

00:48:15.930 --> 00:48:17.930
His name is Ted Leonsis,

00:48:18.821 --> 00:48:21.754
and he owns our local sports franchises.

00:48:21.754 --> 00:48:25.331
He's a member of our board of directors.

00:48:25.331 --> 00:48:28.450
He commented to the
audience that we were with

00:48:28.450 --> 00:48:30.750
that he and I had been
in these conversations

00:48:30.750 --> 00:48:33.213
for more than two decades.

00:48:33.213 --> 00:48:37.296
He would bring these
various ideas, usually these

00:48:39.466 --> 00:48:40.716
killer threats.

00:48:42.502 --> 00:48:44.822
And so I mentioned at the time

00:48:44.822 --> 00:48:48.348
that Ted is regarded as a disruptor.

00:48:48.348 --> 00:48:53.024
For me, he's just disrupted a
lot of sleep over the years,

00:48:53.024 --> 00:48:55.593
but more importantly, I think honestly

00:48:55.593 --> 00:48:57.429
the challenge that we wrestle with,

00:48:57.429 --> 00:49:00.573
it's been embodied and embedded
in some of the questions

00:49:00.573 --> 00:49:02.324
and some of the work

00:49:02.324 --> 00:49:04.474
that has been characterizing this project

00:49:04.474 --> 00:49:08.307
over the last few months
and as we go forward.

00:49:09.229 --> 00:49:11.727
How do we protect what is most important

00:49:11.727 --> 00:49:15.894
about what we are but
accelerate the rate of change

00:49:16.822 --> 00:49:20.662
in a way that is a bit
uncomfortable for us?

00:49:20.662 --> 00:49:23.769
We know that there's only
one way we're going to

00:49:23.769 --> 00:49:27.462
get to where we need to get
to, and that is together.

00:49:27.462 --> 00:49:31.520
But our normal rate of change,
our normal pace of change

00:49:31.520 --> 00:49:36.010
in the university context
may be a mismatch right now

00:49:36.010 --> 00:49:39.182
for some of the threats
that we're confronting.

00:49:39.182 --> 00:49:42.960
The way I sometimes
describe it with colleagues

00:49:42.960 --> 00:49:45.694
around the office and
around conference tables

00:49:45.694 --> 00:49:49.175
and the like is we can't
get better fast enough

00:49:49.175 --> 00:49:51.503
in some really important ways,

00:49:51.503 --> 00:49:55.448
and the challenge is to try
to make sure we're doing that

00:49:55.448 --> 00:49:58.042
so that we're all getting there together.

00:49:58.042 --> 00:50:02.889
- But an element of that is
we're not all going to agree.

00:50:02.889 --> 00:50:06.166
We're going to move before we all agree,

00:50:06.166 --> 00:50:08.492
which is very difficult
for the university.

00:50:08.492 --> 00:50:11.339
But gotta do it, and you
all have to kind of agree.

00:50:11.339 --> 00:50:13.629
One of the things that were discovered,

00:50:13.629 --> 00:50:15.884
when I discovered that people
were as change averse at MIT

00:50:15.884 --> 00:50:19.689
as people are, I realized there
was something else marvelous

00:50:19.689 --> 00:50:22.665
about MIT is that while
people don't like change,

00:50:22.665 --> 00:50:26.183
no one can deny you an experiment.

00:50:26.183 --> 00:50:27.550
And then I thought, wow.

00:50:27.550 --> 00:50:29.311
That's how you do things anyway.

00:50:29.311 --> 00:50:31.305
Let's do an experiment.

00:50:31.305 --> 00:50:33.874
Let's try this, and if it doesn't work

00:50:33.874 --> 00:50:35.397
we'll try something else,

00:50:35.397 --> 00:50:37.858
but this whole sense of
being light on your feet,

00:50:37.858 --> 00:50:40.170
and that's at the core, I
mean that is at the core

00:50:40.170 --> 00:50:43.304
of the university, and somehow we forget

00:50:43.304 --> 00:50:46.749
that the core of the
university is discovery,

00:50:46.749 --> 00:50:48.860
it's innovation, and
we need to be that way

00:50:48.860 --> 00:50:50.618
about the institution itself,

00:50:50.618 --> 00:50:54.057
not just about what each of us studies.

00:50:54.057 --> 00:50:56.390
In terms of what kept me up,

00:50:59.886 --> 00:51:03.395
there's not a lot of time to sleep,

00:51:03.395 --> 00:51:07.176
so during my five hours I could sleep.

00:51:07.176 --> 00:51:11.343
The truth be told, one of the
amazing privileges of being

00:51:12.634 --> 00:51:15.551
a university president is you touch

00:51:17.660 --> 00:51:19.391
hundreds of thousands of things

00:51:19.391 --> 00:51:21.370
and hundreds of thousands of people,

00:51:21.370 --> 00:51:23.747
and there are dozens
and dozens of problems.

00:51:23.747 --> 00:51:26.768
Any little thing, and so your day,

00:51:26.768 --> 00:51:29.215
the big effort is to get beyond

00:51:29.215 --> 00:51:30.992
the thing that's keeping you up today

00:51:30.992 --> 00:51:35.807
because the thing that's
keeping you up over months,

00:51:35.807 --> 00:51:39.081
there isn't any one thing that kept me up,

00:51:39.081 --> 00:51:41.907
but this issue of how
you move into the future

00:51:41.907 --> 00:51:44.938
I think is the most
important responsibility

00:51:44.938 --> 00:51:48.359
of a university president
and the most vexing.

00:51:48.359 --> 00:51:49.295
- [Jack] Thank you.

00:51:49.295 --> 00:51:50.519
Please introduce yourself.

00:51:50.519 --> 00:51:52.125
- [Alyssa] Hi, my name is Alyssa Huberts,

00:51:52.125 --> 00:51:53.447
and I'm an undergraduate here.

00:51:53.447 --> 00:51:55.103
I'm a senior in the
School of Foreign Service.

00:51:55.103 --> 00:51:56.746
Thank you both for being here.

00:51:56.746 --> 00:51:58.836
I was really glad to hear you
guys touch a little bit on

00:51:58.836 --> 00:52:01.091
global engagement and science diplomacy.

00:52:01.091 --> 00:52:02.983
Engagement is a buzzword up here

00:52:02.983 --> 00:52:05.708
on this nice banner we have printed,

00:52:05.708 --> 00:52:07.343
but I'd love to hear a little more

00:52:07.343 --> 00:52:09.139
about community engagement,

00:52:09.139 --> 00:52:10.775
and something that I've been really proud

00:52:10.775 --> 00:52:12.898
and excited about my
school about the four years

00:52:12.898 --> 00:52:14.770
is the way that Georgetown has started

00:52:14.770 --> 00:52:17.063
to open up those conversations
about what is our role

00:52:17.063 --> 00:52:18.995
in DC and in our community,

00:52:18.995 --> 00:52:22.633
and I'd love to hear what
happens at MIT with Cambridge,

00:52:22.633 --> 00:52:24.315
what happened at Yale with New Haven,

00:52:24.315 --> 00:52:27.320
and sort of what is the university's role?

00:52:27.320 --> 00:52:28.859
We talked so much about place,

00:52:28.859 --> 00:52:33.026
but I think our place extends
beyond just our campus.

00:52:33.995 --> 00:52:34.828
- Yeah.

00:52:38.941 --> 00:52:43.055
So there is increasing
engagement of universities

00:52:43.055 --> 00:52:46.595
with their communities,
and communities are asking,

00:52:46.595 --> 00:52:50.762
demanding more of universities,
usually in terms of dollars,

00:52:53.519 --> 00:52:57.971
and I think that one of
the incredible values

00:52:57.971 --> 00:53:01.582
of engaging is, I kind of
draw this cartoon of MIT

00:53:01.582 --> 00:53:04.170
being founded to do tech transfer.

00:53:04.170 --> 00:53:06.997
That is a very important way in which MIT

00:53:06.997 --> 00:53:09.874
has engaged with the
community in Kendall Square.

00:53:09.874 --> 00:53:11.891
I mean the place is
littered with companies

00:53:11.891 --> 00:53:13.679
that have spun out of MIT or companies

00:53:13.679 --> 00:53:17.846
that actually have MIT faculty
or students as their heads.

00:53:19.147 --> 00:53:22.883
That's one kind of engagement, but I think

00:53:22.883 --> 00:53:27.123
in my mind, I always have to
think about the most important

00:53:27.123 --> 00:53:29.962
responsibilities of the university

00:53:29.962 --> 00:53:32.212
are education and research,

00:53:33.119 --> 00:53:35.194
and the engagements in our community

00:53:35.194 --> 00:53:37.751
have to be configured in ways that

00:53:37.751 --> 00:53:41.290
our students and faculty actually learn.

00:53:41.290 --> 00:53:43.211
It's not actually do-gooding.

00:53:43.211 --> 00:53:45.670
Do-gooding is fine, and
I'm happy for universities

00:53:45.670 --> 00:53:47.725
to give our students and
faculty lots of opportunities

00:53:47.725 --> 00:53:50.782
to engage productively
in our neighborhoods,

00:53:50.782 --> 00:53:54.949
and I think that's an
important human responsibility,

00:53:55.928 --> 00:53:58.415
and I think it's a way
that universities can teach

00:53:58.415 --> 00:54:01.288
that human responsibility
is providing opportunities

00:54:01.288 --> 00:54:03.935
and creating an ethos and expectation

00:54:03.935 --> 00:54:06.263
that you will be generous with your time

00:54:06.263 --> 00:54:09.899
and with your money in your communities.

00:54:09.899 --> 00:54:14.144
But I think that probably
even more aligned

00:54:14.144 --> 00:54:18.024
with the university's mission
of research and education

00:54:18.024 --> 00:54:20.375
is engaging in ways
that allow our students

00:54:20.375 --> 00:54:23.565
to learn about themselves
to learn about their cities

00:54:23.565 --> 00:54:26.982
and our faculty to pursue their research.

00:54:28.319 --> 00:54:31.611
So I think simply to say that
everyone should be racing

00:54:31.611 --> 00:54:33.814
after the university's
primary responsibilities

00:54:33.814 --> 00:54:36.226
to engage in the community
I just don't think is right.

00:54:36.226 --> 00:54:39.419
I think the university's
primary responsibility is to

00:54:39.419 --> 00:54:41.842
advance the research
and education mission,

00:54:41.842 --> 00:54:44.303
and much of that can be done

00:54:44.303 --> 00:54:46.788
by interacting with our communities.

00:54:46.788 --> 00:54:48.799
- [Jack] Thank you.

00:54:48.799 --> 00:54:50.463
- [Jeff] My name is Jeff Anderson,

00:54:50.463 --> 00:54:52.030
professor in the School of Foreign Service

00:54:52.030 --> 00:54:54.178
in the government department.

00:54:54.178 --> 00:54:56.303
I want to start with a bit
of a cushion or disclaimer

00:54:56.303 --> 00:54:58.263
which is I'm going to ask what I think

00:54:58.263 --> 00:55:01.790
is a pretty gloomy
question to two leaders,

00:55:01.790 --> 00:55:03.611
a current president and a former president

00:55:03.611 --> 00:55:06.420
who have taken very
brave and ethical stance

00:55:06.420 --> 00:55:07.883
on issues of the day,

00:55:07.883 --> 00:55:10.366
so please don't read into this question,

00:55:10.366 --> 00:55:11.665
the notion that I don't think

00:55:11.665 --> 00:55:13.790
you're doing enough to change the world.

00:55:13.790 --> 00:55:16.150
But my question has to do in
a way with changing the world.

00:55:16.150 --> 00:55:19.031
I worry that we're not
going to be able to protect

00:55:19.031 --> 00:55:22.376
what's valuable in the
university, in particular

00:55:22.376 --> 00:55:25.354
in a context of growing inequality

00:55:25.354 --> 00:55:28.279
and declining social mobility.

00:55:28.279 --> 00:55:30.151
And if those problems aren't addressed,

00:55:30.151 --> 00:55:34.148
do we have any hope of
preserving what's valuable here?

00:55:34.148 --> 00:55:36.923
I worry that one response, which I've seen

00:55:36.923 --> 00:55:41.279
in some universities is to
mimic the auto companies where

00:55:41.279 --> 00:55:43.918
you sell a luxury product like an Audi

00:55:43.918 --> 00:55:46.631
to those who can afford
it and you crank out

00:55:46.631 --> 00:55:48.714
the rabbits for the rest.

00:55:49.654 --> 00:55:53.207
In a way, if you do that
you end up reinforcing

00:55:53.207 --> 00:55:56.195
the problems, not correcting it.

00:55:56.195 --> 00:55:58.300
So I'm just wondering what you think about

00:55:58.300 --> 00:56:00.427
these larger contextual problems,

00:56:00.427 --> 00:56:02.751
and is there anything one can do here

00:56:02.751 --> 00:56:05.578
in these little oases
to reverse those trends?

00:56:05.578 --> 00:56:07.175
Thank you.

00:56:07.175 --> 00:56:11.008
- Yeah let me just pick
up on the car company.

00:56:13.163 --> 00:56:17.337
So one of my concerns
about digital technologies,

00:56:17.337 --> 00:56:21.504
teaching technologies is
that residential education

00:56:22.570 --> 00:56:25.894
as we do it is enormously expensive.

00:56:25.894 --> 00:56:28.183
We've done a calculation at MIT that shows

00:56:28.183 --> 00:56:30.325
that it costs two, two and a half,

00:56:30.325 --> 00:56:32.400
maybe three times as much as tuition

00:56:32.400 --> 00:56:34.463
to educate every undergraduate.

00:56:34.463 --> 00:56:37.364
Very expensive extraordinary experience,

00:56:37.364 --> 00:56:39.181
and then we've got this other domain now

00:56:39.181 --> 00:56:41.579
which is online, and it's free.

00:56:41.579 --> 00:56:44.313
I don't know if that's
the rabbit Audi model,

00:56:44.313 --> 00:56:46.391
but my worry is it may
be the rabbit Audi model,

00:56:46.391 --> 00:56:50.558
and if it is, that rabbit
has to be gosh darn good,

00:56:51.410 --> 00:56:55.187
and it's one of the, for me
the excitements about edX

00:56:55.187 --> 00:56:56.721
and these new technologies.

00:56:56.721 --> 00:56:57.827
They are just so much better than

00:56:57.827 --> 00:56:59.811
getting a book out of the library.

00:56:59.811 --> 00:57:02.894
That is I think one of my concerns is

00:57:04.375 --> 00:57:05.890
whether residential education

00:57:05.890 --> 00:57:07.777
as we're currently thinking about it

00:57:07.777 --> 00:57:11.626
is increasingly to be the province of only

00:57:11.626 --> 00:57:16.319
those who can afford the
time, not just the cost.

00:57:16.319 --> 00:57:18.794
MIT has been great about financial aid

00:57:18.794 --> 00:57:20.898
actually for decades and decades

00:57:20.898 --> 00:57:23.391
making possible for any student

00:57:23.391 --> 00:57:26.546
who we feel has the ability and ambition

00:57:26.546 --> 00:57:29.629
to succeed to come to the MIT campus.

00:57:35.940 --> 00:57:39.940
Let me just tell you two
of my big worries about

00:57:40.794 --> 00:57:43.041
the United States.

00:57:43.041 --> 00:57:44.861
One has to do with academic ambition,

00:57:44.861 --> 00:57:47.168
and the other is immigration.

00:57:47.168 --> 00:57:50.042
So we are, I'll start with immigration.

00:57:50.042 --> 00:57:51.329
Back in the conversation

00:57:51.329 --> 00:57:55.496
after the State of the
Union speech, we are crazy.

00:57:56.538 --> 00:57:58.206
We are just crazy.

00:57:58.206 --> 00:58:01.527
As recently as 15 years ago,
maybe even 10 years ago,

00:58:01.527 --> 00:58:03.573
but certainly 15 years ago,

00:58:03.573 --> 00:58:05.428
if someone got a degree from Georgetown,

00:58:05.428 --> 00:58:09.023
someone from some other
country came here for school,

00:58:09.023 --> 00:58:11.419
got a degree from Georgetown, from MIT,

00:58:11.419 --> 00:58:13.411
for most of them their first choice

00:58:13.411 --> 00:58:15.353
of where they wanted to work would be

00:58:15.353 --> 00:58:17.226
to stay in the United States,

00:58:17.226 --> 00:58:19.749
and second choice was
really distant second

00:58:19.749 --> 00:58:22.852
because there weren't great
opportunities elsewhere.

00:58:22.852 --> 00:58:24.905
They would put up with all the indignities

00:58:24.905 --> 00:58:28.926
of the US immigration
system in order to stay.

00:58:28.926 --> 00:58:30.201
Guess what?

00:58:30.201 --> 00:58:32.705
There are great opportunities elsewhere,

00:58:32.705 --> 00:58:35.356
and I know from talking to MIT graduates,

00:58:35.356 --> 00:58:37.329
and my guess is probably
true of Georgetown,

00:58:37.329 --> 00:58:39.727
maybe not as many but most of the people

00:58:39.727 --> 00:58:41.486
who get degrees from
MIT would love to stay

00:58:41.486 --> 00:58:42.930
in the United States.

00:58:42.930 --> 00:58:45.918
Second choice is a really
good second choice now,

00:58:45.918 --> 00:58:48.025
and our immigration system is
the same it was 15 years ago,

00:58:48.025 --> 00:58:50.253
so imagining these people will
put up with the indignities

00:58:50.253 --> 00:58:53.970
of immigration system
and stay is just dumb.

00:58:53.970 --> 00:58:57.720
I just think we've gotta
make it possible for

00:59:00.857 --> 00:59:04.360
talented people from around the world

00:59:04.360 --> 00:59:06.037
who want to stay in the United States

00:59:06.037 --> 00:59:08.104
after we've paid for their education,

00:59:08.104 --> 00:59:11.596
whether they paid half of the
cost by paying tuition or not,

00:59:11.596 --> 00:59:14.513
I just think that really worries me

00:59:17.202 --> 00:59:19.374
about opportunity.

00:59:19.374 --> 00:59:21.534
But more seriously, I
think a more serious issue

00:59:21.534 --> 00:59:25.652
to your question is academic achievement

00:59:25.652 --> 00:59:27.637
and academic ambition.

00:59:27.637 --> 00:59:30.630
It won't surprise you that
I believe that education

00:59:30.630 --> 00:59:33.630
is the root to socioeconomic change,

00:59:37.127 --> 00:59:39.453
but it's like the joke about

00:59:39.453 --> 00:59:42.332
how may psychiatrists does it
take to change a light bulb?

00:59:42.332 --> 00:59:46.470
Only one, but the light bulb
has to really want to change.

00:59:46.470 --> 00:59:50.068
If 75 or 50% of the kids in the nation

00:59:50.068 --> 00:59:52.735
don't have an academic ambition,

00:59:53.682 --> 00:59:55.638
they don't come from homes that say

00:59:55.638 --> 00:59:57.440
the first thing you gotta
do is do well in school

00:59:57.440 --> 01:00:00.256
and then you can play soccer
and then you can play football,

01:00:00.256 --> 01:00:04.505
if as a nation we've departed
from the idea of education

01:00:04.505 --> 01:00:08.005
as the root to a better life, we are lost.

01:00:09.414 --> 01:00:11.464
And I don't know any way to fix it.

01:00:11.464 --> 01:00:14.408
We can push push push in the schools

01:00:14.408 --> 01:00:16.121
and do everything I think we need

01:00:16.121 --> 01:00:17.724
to make our schools better,

01:00:17.724 --> 01:00:21.182
but my real worry is that
as a nation we have just,

01:00:21.182 --> 01:00:24.831
our values are so distorted
that we will never solve

01:00:24.831 --> 01:00:28.407
the socioeconomic disparity problem

01:00:28.407 --> 01:00:31.157
if the people who we need to help

01:00:32.659 --> 01:00:34.966
don't buy in because
of our social messages,

01:00:34.966 --> 01:00:36.742
what you see on TV, any number of places

01:00:36.742 --> 01:00:37.892
the message is going to be,

01:00:37.892 --> 01:00:40.798
don't understand that
you gotta help yourself.

01:00:40.798 --> 01:00:41.662
I'm sorry.

01:00:41.662 --> 01:00:43.883
That's pretty depressing.

01:00:43.883 --> 01:00:45.299
That's my worry.

01:00:45.299 --> 01:00:47.697
- I'm going to, Jeff, just pick up

01:00:47.697 --> 01:00:49.636
a little bit on your comments

01:00:49.636 --> 01:00:52.788
because I would concur that inequality

01:00:52.788 --> 01:00:55.654
is the great fault line for our republic,

01:00:55.654 --> 01:00:58.904
and unless we as a nation take this on,

01:00:59.902 --> 01:01:03.597
and it really does require
all of us to take this on.

01:01:03.597 --> 01:01:05.290
Two weeks ago today I had the privilege

01:01:05.290 --> 01:01:08.507
to attend a summit at the
White House on access,

01:01:08.507 --> 01:01:11.277
affordability for higher education,

01:01:11.277 --> 01:01:13.210
and some of the themes
that are very resonant

01:01:13.210 --> 01:01:17.494
with the question were in play
in our conversation there.

01:01:17.494 --> 01:01:19.582
The current framework we're in right now

01:01:19.582 --> 01:01:21.832
is exacerbating inequality,

01:01:23.400 --> 01:01:25.159
but we know how to do this,

01:01:25.159 --> 01:01:29.171
and if you go back just
roughly 60 some odd years ago,

01:01:29.171 --> 01:01:32.435
following the Second World War
we had a national consensus

01:01:32.435 --> 01:01:34.476
that we would achieve, we would have

01:01:34.476 --> 01:01:37.513
the greatest public
institutions in the world

01:01:37.513 --> 01:01:40.096
for education, and we did that,

01:01:41.519 --> 01:01:45.130
but we were last number one in 1992.

01:01:45.130 --> 01:01:49.382
Right now we're probably
somewhere around 14th.

01:01:49.382 --> 01:01:52.560
Most of new job creation,
2/3 of all new job creation

01:01:52.560 --> 01:01:54.275
in the United States requires some form

01:01:54.275 --> 01:01:56.541
of post secondary education,

01:01:56.541 --> 01:01:58.594
but if you look at our 15 year olds,

01:01:58.594 --> 01:02:00.214
let's start with 15 year olds.

01:02:00.214 --> 01:02:02.500
A 100 15-year-olds.

01:02:02.500 --> 01:02:06.254
Right now we have the highest
high school graduation rate

01:02:06.254 --> 01:02:08.142
in our lifetimes.

01:02:08.142 --> 01:02:12.879
Right now it's at 75%, and
that is a great achievement

01:02:12.879 --> 01:02:15.579
that a lot of have been
putting a lot of work in

01:02:15.579 --> 01:02:17.355
for a long time.

01:02:17.355 --> 01:02:20.699
But it does mean that 25
out of 100 15-year-olds

01:02:20.699 --> 01:02:23.449
never see the end of high school,

01:02:24.600 --> 01:02:27.062
and that future without some form

01:02:27.062 --> 01:02:28.479
of post secondary education

01:02:28.479 --> 01:02:32.556
for those 25 kids is very very difficult.

01:02:32.556 --> 01:02:36.207
Now we have a tremendous penetration rate

01:02:36.207 --> 01:02:39.854
of our graduates of high
school onto post secondary,

01:02:39.854 --> 01:02:41.641
but we don't have a great completion rate.

01:02:41.641 --> 01:02:44.547
Roughly half of those
who go on will finish

01:02:44.547 --> 01:02:45.880
a two year degree or more.

01:02:45.880 --> 01:02:50.007
So right now roughly 40%
of our eligible population

01:02:50.007 --> 01:02:53.152
has a two year degree or higher.

01:02:53.152 --> 01:02:55.695
Roughly, a little under right around 30%

01:02:55.695 --> 01:02:57.747
would have a four year degree.

01:02:57.747 --> 01:03:01.764
We as a nation can't compete
if we're only ensuring

01:03:01.764 --> 01:03:05.160
that roughly a third of our young people

01:03:05.160 --> 01:03:09.061
are getting the kind of
education that they need.

01:03:09.061 --> 01:03:11.019
The problem really, the
core of the problem,

01:03:11.019 --> 01:03:14.198
80% of all the education that
takes place in post secondary

01:03:14.198 --> 01:03:17.315
in the United States is
in public institutions.

01:03:17.315 --> 01:03:19.275
We represent two private institutions,

01:03:19.275 --> 01:03:23.463
and without financial aid
policies, our recruitment efforts,

01:03:23.463 --> 01:03:26.223
our outreach and the like,

01:03:26.223 --> 01:03:29.806
I think we have some
things to be proud of,

01:03:31.239 --> 01:03:35.967
but we have to contribute
to this national crisis

01:03:35.967 --> 01:03:39.746
of recommitting ourselves as a people

01:03:39.746 --> 01:03:43.663
to ensuring that our
system of public education

01:03:44.509 --> 01:03:46.285
gets back to being
number one in the world,

01:03:46.285 --> 01:03:48.288
and we are not doing the things

01:03:48.288 --> 01:03:49.202
that we need to do.

01:03:49.202 --> 01:03:52.082
Our policies are not going
to enable that to occur

01:03:52.082 --> 01:03:53.678
by the end of this
decade which is the goal

01:03:53.678 --> 01:03:55.681
the president has established.

01:03:55.681 --> 01:03:57.795
We're just not moving in that direction.

01:03:57.795 --> 01:04:01.174
States are not able to fund at
the level that they need to.

01:04:01.174 --> 01:04:05.630
So we have real issues,
and it matters to us

01:04:05.630 --> 01:04:08.714
because higher education is a very,

01:04:08.714 --> 01:04:11.823
in the United States is
an incredible ecosystem

01:04:11.823 --> 01:04:15.010
where all the pieces
play off of one another.

01:04:15.010 --> 01:04:16.377
We're that much stronger

01:04:16.377 --> 01:04:19.163
because of the great public institutions,

01:04:19.163 --> 01:04:22.525
but right now the trajectory
for them is not strong,

01:04:22.525 --> 01:04:26.665
and that's a piece we all
have to contribute to.

01:04:26.665 --> 01:04:29.113
So I think we've got time
for one more question.

01:04:29.113 --> 01:04:30.492
Please introduce yourself.

01:04:30.492 --> 01:04:32.161
- [Bill] Bill Licamele,
I'm a child psychiatrist

01:04:32.161 --> 01:04:33.984
who is trying to get people
to change light bulbs

01:04:33.984 --> 01:04:37.009
under the clinical faculty here.

01:04:37.009 --> 01:04:39.590
It's an excellent discussion and insight

01:04:39.590 --> 01:04:41.557
into looking designing the future.

01:04:41.557 --> 01:04:43.413
I wonder if you can comment on your

01:04:43.413 --> 01:04:44.997
experience at Yale and MIT.

01:04:44.997 --> 01:04:47.470
You mentioned bright faculty
getting them together.

01:04:47.470 --> 01:04:49.802
You mentioned the students
and obviously administrators.

01:04:49.802 --> 01:04:51.951
What have you seen as the
role or the potential role

01:04:51.951 --> 01:04:55.246
for alumni in this effort
to designing the future?

01:04:55.246 --> 01:04:56.089
Thank you.

01:04:56.089 --> 01:04:56.922
- Wow.

01:04:56.922 --> 01:04:57.755
Thank you.

01:04:57.755 --> 01:05:01.105
Interesting question
and important question.

01:05:01.105 --> 01:05:04.667
One of the reasons it's so important

01:05:04.667 --> 01:05:07.084
is the astonishing allegiance

01:05:09.276 --> 01:05:14.015
that alumni have for
where they went to school.

01:05:14.015 --> 01:05:15.015
Astonishing.

01:05:16.271 --> 01:05:18.072
And why is that?

01:05:18.072 --> 01:05:19.905
Why is it that people,

01:05:21.207 --> 01:05:24.290
grownups, old people continue to wear

01:05:25.932 --> 01:05:28.330
logo wear from their college?

01:05:28.330 --> 01:05:30.131
How crazy is that?

01:05:30.131 --> 01:05:31.916
Have they not had another experience?

01:05:31.916 --> 01:05:35.050
Did no one give them a free fleece

01:05:35.050 --> 01:05:37.959
with some other logo on it?

01:05:37.959 --> 01:05:42.126
I think it's because of
this process of formation,

01:05:44.143 --> 01:05:48.069
of self definition that
happens in the context

01:05:48.069 --> 01:05:50.463
of an educational institution.

01:05:50.463 --> 01:05:52.963
So alumni want very much guard

01:05:54.975 --> 01:05:56.475
their institutions

01:05:58.118 --> 01:05:59.807
and want to

01:05:59.807 --> 01:06:03.769
have a voice in how those
institutions evolve.

01:06:03.769 --> 01:06:06.695
Many alumni, so I don't
know about your board,

01:06:06.695 --> 01:06:08.460
but MIT has a very large board,

01:06:08.460 --> 01:06:10.282
75 members of the corporation.

01:06:10.282 --> 01:06:14.484
Not all of them, but
most of them are alumni.

01:06:14.484 --> 01:06:18.012
So we give them a formal
role in governance.

01:06:18.012 --> 01:06:21.595
We have MIT has 31
visiting committees that

01:06:23.052 --> 01:06:25.346
review every department, every academic

01:06:25.346 --> 01:06:27.349
and many non-academic activities.

01:06:27.349 --> 01:06:29.316
A third of the members of
those visiting committees

01:06:29.316 --> 01:06:32.807
are alumni, so they have an assigned role

01:06:32.807 --> 01:06:37.500
in guiding the future of
the institution in that way.

01:06:37.500 --> 01:06:39.513
I think formal ways are great.

01:06:39.513 --> 01:06:41.542
Informal ways are also important.

01:06:41.542 --> 01:06:43.550
The only thing I would, the only reason

01:06:43.550 --> 01:06:46.284
why I would hesitate
about the role of alumni,

01:06:46.284 --> 01:06:48.081
and of course I don't know
how many alumni you've,

01:06:48.081 --> 01:06:49.307
how many alumni do you have?

01:06:49.307 --> 01:06:50.476
- [Jack] About 160,000.

01:06:50.476 --> 01:06:51.982
- Yeah we have 125,000.

01:06:51.982 --> 01:06:55.429
So a lot of voice coming from
a lot of different places,

01:06:55.429 --> 01:06:59.596
and having ways for them
to be engaged is important.

01:07:01.212 --> 01:07:02.962
However, one caution.

01:07:03.926 --> 01:07:06.045
We've all seen this.

01:07:06.045 --> 01:07:09.212
So you are so fond of that candy store

01:07:10.390 --> 01:07:14.941
that was just down the
street when you were a kid.

01:07:14.941 --> 01:07:17.687
The candies that were sold were
probably poisonous actually.

01:07:17.687 --> 01:07:19.428
We probably wouldn't be able to,

01:07:19.428 --> 01:07:21.831
but when that candy store
goes out of business

01:07:21.831 --> 01:07:23.387
and it becomes an Italian restaurant,

01:07:23.387 --> 01:07:24.972
you think how could they do that?

01:07:24.972 --> 01:07:26.133
How could they get rid of the candy store?

01:07:26.133 --> 01:07:27.970
Well people don't go to
candy stores anymore.

01:07:27.970 --> 01:07:30.609
They go to Italian restaurants.

01:07:30.609 --> 01:07:34.776
There is a sense of nostalgia
that alumni often feel

01:07:35.639 --> 01:07:37.639
that tie institutions to

01:07:39.955 --> 01:07:40.788
the past

01:07:41.637 --> 01:07:44.395
that often is not in the
institution's best interest.

01:07:44.395 --> 01:07:47.792
And so I've seen this, and it's just

01:07:47.792 --> 01:07:52.388
having alumni engagement is
important in so many ways

01:07:52.388 --> 01:07:56.501
but also can be difficult in other ways.

01:07:56.501 --> 01:07:58.050
One of the great roles for alumni,

01:07:58.050 --> 01:08:00.184
I can't tell you how important
this role was for me at MIT

01:08:00.184 --> 01:08:03.213
in understanding where
MIT needed to change.

01:08:03.213 --> 01:08:05.513
Where we really needed to change

01:08:05.513 --> 01:08:09.092
was hearing alumni, hearing from alumni

01:08:09.092 --> 01:08:10.842
what they didn't get.

01:08:12.127 --> 01:08:14.877
And so it won't surprise you that

01:08:15.840 --> 01:08:18.223
MIT is very focused on the right answer,

01:08:18.223 --> 01:08:20.220
and you very well at MIT
when you get the right answer

01:08:20.220 --> 01:08:23.154
and surprise, our alumni, we
had students who graduated,

01:08:23.154 --> 01:08:25.470
they had gotten into the real world.

01:08:25.470 --> 01:08:28.183
The right answer isn't enough.

01:08:28.183 --> 01:08:31.427
And MIT frankly hadn't
prepared our students

01:08:31.427 --> 01:08:33.818
with the other skills
that go along with making

01:08:33.818 --> 01:08:37.322
the right answer actually
work in the real world.

01:08:37.322 --> 01:08:40.845
It was enormous help
to us in understanding

01:08:40.845 --> 01:08:44.349
how to amplify what we
were currently teaching

01:08:44.349 --> 01:08:46.500
to provide our students with the skills

01:08:46.500 --> 01:08:47.675
they were going to need.

01:08:47.675 --> 01:08:49.896
So I think the alumni perspective

01:08:49.896 --> 01:08:52.813
on what the university does well at

01:08:52.813 --> 01:08:55.909
but also what the university needs to do

01:08:55.909 --> 01:08:58.969
to prepare our graduates to have

01:08:58.969 --> 01:09:00.698
a greater impact in the world

01:09:00.698 --> 01:09:02.069
I think is critically important.

01:09:02.069 --> 01:09:03.218
So needs to be a voice.

01:09:03.218 --> 01:09:07.135
How you manage 165,000
voices, that's your job.

01:09:08.978 --> 01:09:10.785
- Ladies and gentlemen, please join me

01:09:10.785 --> 01:09:12.805
in expressing our appreciation
to Susan Hockfield.

01:09:12.805 --> 01:09:13.909
(applause)

01:09:13.909 --> 01:09:14.742
Thank you.
