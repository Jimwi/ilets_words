00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.790
A century ago, a conflict arose which
would quickly become

00:00:03.790 --> 00:00:07.320
one of the most complex and controversial in the world.

00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:12.160
A conflict between two very different people for the same territory.

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:17.480
To understand its origins, let's retrace the history of the Jewish people on a map.

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:21.740
The Israeli-Palestinian conflict will be explained in a following video.

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:29.060
The story begins in 750 BC

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:33.860
when the Near East was divided into many small kingdoms and city-states.

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:39.000
They were wedged between the Assyrian Empire to the north and Egypt in the south.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:45.420
Among them was the Kingdom of Israel whose people worshipped several gods, including Yahweh.

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:51.240
In 722 BC, the capital Samaria fell to the Assyrian empire.

00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:55.780
Part of the population then fled to the Kingdom of Judah and Jerusalem.

00:00:55.780 --> 00:01:01.200
But they would be followed by the Assyrian army as they continued their
expansion towards the south.

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:07.200
The region then remains under their control for a century until the fall of Nineveh to the Babylonians.

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:11.260
Egypt and Babylon would then
compete for territories of the old empire.

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:15.800
But the Babylonians quickly take
over and project their power in the region.

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:19.340
Jerusalem resists this new rule and rebels.

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:23.780
The Babylonian army then returns to besiege and destroy the city.

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:27.300
Much of the population is then moved to the capital.

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:32.680
In 539 BC, the Achaemenid Persian empire takes over Babylon.

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:38.920
The new king authorizes a free passage
for Judeans, prompting many to return to Jerusalem.

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:43.380
They would then rebuild the city and organize the foundations of Jewish culture

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:47.680
by building the Temple of
Solomon and writing the Torah.

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:56.720
In 334 BC, the ambitious young Macedonian king, Alexander the Great,

00:01:56.720 --> 00:02:00.020
set out with his army to conquer the known world.

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:05.000
In just over 10 years, he rakes up a huge territory and builds many cities.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:11.700
But, exhausted by conquest, he died at age 32 in Babylon without an heir of governing age.

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:16.800
The empire was then divided by his generals into various Hellenic kingdoms.

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:20.940
Judea came under the control of the Ptolemaic dynasty.

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:27.540
A Jewish community settles in the new city of Alexandria and the Torah is translated into Greek.

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:31.540
Following a war against the Seleucid dynasty,

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:35.260
Hellenic and Jewish culture developed friction to the point that

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:41.180
one of the altars of the Temple of Solomon in Jerusalem was dedicated to the worship of Zeus.

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:48.900
A traditionalist, anti-Hellenic Jewish militia is organized and takes control of Jerusalem in 164 BC.

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:53.980
The temple is restored and the kingdom of Judea becomes independent.

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:58.180
A century later the region was conquered by the Roman army.

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:03.880
The Judeans would organize two major revolts against the new regime, which were violently crushed.

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:10.060
The first revolt in 66 provoked the siege of Jerusalem followed by the destruction of its temple.

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:15.300
The only wall of the enclosure that survived would become known as the Wailing Wall.

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:21.060
During the second revolt, the city was razed and a great part of the population slaughtered.

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:25.520
This time, the Jews were forbidden a safe passage to Judea.

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:29.880
Many migrated to Galilee and
across the empire.

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:37.260
Towards the end of the Roman empire,
Christianity was the dominant religion

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:40.020
and Jerusalem a place of pilgrimage.

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:43.720
The largely well-to-do Jewish community in the Mediterranean Basin

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:49.900
began to be persecuted, especially in the Visigoths and Byzantine empires.

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:55.280
In the 7th century, following the birth of Islam, begins an Arab conquest.

00:03:55.280 --> 00:04:00.020
In some cases Jews support the conquest in the hope of better conditions.

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:05.520
They are tolerated by the Arabs and only polytheistic peoples are forcibly converted.

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:12.400
In Jerusalem, the Dome of the Rock is built, making the city holy to the three monotheistic religions.

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:17.160
The Arabs arrive at the Iberian Peninsula, which they call Al-Andalus.

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:22.680
Here, 5% of the population is Jewish, ushering in a golden age of culture.

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:28.620
Meanwhile in Europe, Jews are not only tolerated as people who witnessed times before Christ,

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:32.760
but also as the sole traders between Catholics and Muslims.

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:38.500
This allows Jews to gradually establish themselves in all of Western Europe.

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:47.800
In the 11th century, the Seljuk Turks, a
Central Asian people,

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:50.540
began their expansion and reached Jerusalem.

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:54.800
They persecute Christians and forbid pilgrimages to the city.

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:58.040
In response, Christians in Europe organized crusades --

00:04:58.040 --> 00:05:02.160
military and religious expeditions to the holy city.

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:05.300
Along the way, they massacred Jewish communities

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:09.660
who they now consider a deicide people, who killed Jesus Christ.

00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:16.420
In 1347, Genoese merchant boats from Caffa helped spread the Black Death.

00:05:16.420 --> 00:05:21.700
In five years, the disease wreaks havoc in Europe, killing almost half its population.

00:05:21.700 --> 00:05:25.860
A rumor spreads accusing Jews of poisoning wells,

00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:32.220
resulting in their persecution mainly along the Rhine and Rhone region and their eventual expulsion.

00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:40.300
In Spain, the Reconquista ends. The Catholic kings serve an ultimatum to the Jews to either convert or leave.

00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:44.360
The majority, who choose to leave, settle
along the Mediterranean coast,

00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:48.240
mainly in the Ottoman Empire, where they are welcomed.

00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:57.840
The Poland-Lithuania Commonwealth becomes a haven for Jews from Western Europe

00:05:57.840 --> 00:06:00.200
due to favourable migration policies.

00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:07.440
In the 17th century, the region hosts more than 300,000 or about half of the Jews in the world.

00:06:07.440 --> 00:06:12.720
But everything changed in 1648 with the revolt of the Cossacks Ukrainian peasants

00:06:12.720 --> 00:06:15.440
against the nobility and the Jews.

00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:19.560
They accused the Jews of having a
privileged relationship with those in power.

00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:23.980
More than 100,000 Jewish people
are killed or flee the region.

00:06:23.980 --> 00:06:27.460
This episode would weaken the
Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth,

00:06:27.460 --> 00:06:30.560
besieged on all sides by neighboring powers.

00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:35.660
In 150 years, the region falls and its territory is carved up.

00:06:35.660 --> 00:06:41.540
The Jewish community is divided and 900,000 of them find themselves in the Russian empire,

00:06:41.540 --> 00:06:43.200
where they are not welcome.

00:06:43.200 --> 00:06:48.860
They quickly become the targets of attacks called "pogroms" -- a Russian term meaning "devastation".

00:06:48.860 --> 00:06:54.660
Given the lack of response from authorities, these attacks become more frequent and deadly.

00:06:58.120 --> 00:07:01.480
The Jews then emigrated to the United
States and Western Europe,

00:07:01.480 --> 00:07:04.800
which in the meantime, has improved their living conditions.

00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:10.840
It is in this context that the first Zionist Congress is held in Basel in 1897,

00:07:10.840 --> 00:07:15.620
contemplating the founding of a new homeland for the Jewish people in Palestine.

00:07:15.620 --> 00:07:19.840
But the Ottoman Empire is fiercely opposed to the project.

00:07:19.840 --> 00:07:23.960
A few years later, the First World War breaks out.

00:07:23.960 --> 00:07:26.900
The Ottoman Empire fought alongside
Germany.

00:07:26.900 --> 00:07:30.540
When the Allies were in trouble and desperately sought further support,

00:07:30.540 --> 00:07:35.580
the then-British minister of Foreign Affairs Arthur Balfour wrote an open letter,

00:07:35.580 --> 00:07:39.920
promising a Jewish homeland in Palestine in return for Jewish support.

00:07:39.920 --> 00:07:44.560
In parallel, they support the Arab rebellion against the Ottoman Empire

00:07:44.560 --> 00:07:47.860
by promising them independence in the liberated territories.

00:07:47.860 --> 00:07:54.240
At the end of the war, the map of the Middle East was redrawn and divided up between the European powers.

00:07:54.240 --> 00:07:56.940
Palestine comes under the British mandate,

00:07:56.940 --> 00:08:01.760
marking the beginning of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict...
