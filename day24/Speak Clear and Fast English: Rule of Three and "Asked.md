1
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:10,400
Wait...did they just say a bad word in English?

2
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:16,000
Nope, they said the word “asked”,
which is the reduced form of

3
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:21,280
asked. I’m Julie with San Diego Voice and Accent,

4
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:29,840
and in this video, I’ll show you how to correctly
reduce the word “asked” using the Rule of Three.

5
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:42,160
American English loves reductions. Why? Because
reductions allow your speech to sound faster.

6
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:49,760
Reductions also help with linking syllables
together. And this is what spoken English is all

7
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:57,840
about: short and fast syllables linking up with
long and slow syllables, and this equals rhythm.

8
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:04,000
The Rule of Three describes one very
powerful way that reductions occur

9
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,560
in spoken English. If this concept is new to you,

10
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:15,120
I recommend that you watch a previous video I
published called The Rule of Three, in which

11
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:20,400
you’ll learn the theory behind the Rule of Three
and you’ll practice using it in common phrases.

12
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:27,440
But here’s a quick recap: The Rule of
Three describes what happens to the T

13
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:34,720
consonant in the word “past” in this
sentence, “Turn left and you will walk

14
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:45,280
past the bookstore.” Listen to
this man as he says that sentence.

15
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:59,360
He said “pass the bookstore” not “past”.
What happened to that final T consonant?

16
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:06,400
According to the Rule of Three, when three or
more consonants are next to each other between

17
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:13,920
vowels or after a vowel, the middle consonant
is often dropped. It disappears completely,

18
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:21,840
especially when it’s a voiceless stop
consonant like the P, T, or K consonants.

19
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:25,520
I want to focus on how the Rule of Three

20
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:32,320
applies to the word asked. I am often asked
about this word - how to pronounce it,

21
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:38,000
how to link it, and how to reduce it.
In this video, you’ll learn all three.

22
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:44,640
First, let’s discuss how to pronounce
this word according to the IPA. Here’s

23
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:51,120
the IPA transcription. You’ll see four
symbols, which means there are four sounds:

24
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:53,815
AAA
SSS

25
00:02:53,815 --> 00:02:56,960
KKK
TTT

26
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:57,440
Asked

27
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:00,320
And if you look closer,

28
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:06,720
you’ll notice that there are three consonants
in a row - the S, K, and T consonants.

29
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:14,640
And if we apply the Rule of Three to this word,
that means the middle K consonant can be dropped.

30
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:20,640
That means, this word can
also be pronounced as: “asst”.

31
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:22,480
Asked

32
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:24,560
Asked

33
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:26,160
Asked

34
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:34,000
Both options are correct. If a native speaker is
trying to speak more carefully or deliberately,

35
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:37,920
or they want to stress the
word asked for some reason,

36
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:43,040
they might choose to use the
full pronunciation, “asked”.

37
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:51,600
Or, if a native speaker is speaking quickly, or
the word asked is unstressed in that sentence,

38
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:55,120
they might choose to use the reduced form, “asst.”

39
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:55,680
Asked

40
00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:02,000
Now let’s look at the word asked
in a sentence, like, “I asked her”,

41
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:05,040
and let’s apply the Rule of Three.

42
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:07,360
I asked her.

43
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:09,200
I asked her.

44
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:14,560
But notice there’s a pronoun
in this sentence, the word her.

45
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:16,000
I asked her.

46
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:21,440
And I used an `intonation` pattern that
placed the stress on the word asked,

47
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:30,160
and the pronoun her was unstressed. That
means, the pronoun can also be reduced.

48
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:36,480
The initial H consonant can be dropped,
and her can be pronounced as er.

49
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:38,640
I asked her.

50
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:40,880
I asked her.

51
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:12,560
I agree with Youglish on this one. I think
it’s much more common in typical speech for

52
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:19,280
a native speaker to reduce both “asked”
and “her” in the phrase, “I asked her”.

53
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:28,320
The same happens in a phrase like, “I asked
him”. Both “asked” and “him” can be reduced,

54
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:33,440
and once they reduce, they link up
much easier than they did before.

55
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:36,160
I asked him

56
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:37,840
I asked him.

57
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:46,320
One thing to be aware of. It’s very important when
applying the Rule of Three to the word “asked”

58
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:50,080
that you always pronounce the T. Don’t drop the T.

59
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:56,640
If you drop the T, you’ll end up saying
“ask”, which is the present tense of asked.

60
00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:03,520
So if you say, “I ask her” for, “I asked
her”, it sounds like the present tense,

61
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:05,840
and this results in a grammar error.

62
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:13,440
Now let’s practice the Rule of Three using
the word “asked”. First, I’ll say the sentence

63
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:20,160
with the full pronunciation of “asked”. Then
I’ll say it according to the Rule of Three.

64
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:24,400
Pay attention to the reductions,
the linking, and the rhythm.

65
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:27,760
She asked him to go.

66
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:30,480
She asked him to go

67
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:09,520
He asked if he could get a raise.

68
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:15,840
He asked if he could get a raise.

69
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:20,160
She asked them to be quiet.

70
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:22,960
She asked them to be quiet.

71
00:07:58,160 --> 00:07:59,040
You asked for it.

72
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:00,880
You asked for it.

73
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:12,000
Thanks so much for watching, and good luck
as you practice using the Rule of Three

74
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:25,840
with the word “asked”. Have a great day.
