00:00:08.417 --> 00:00:11.018
Today, I'm simply a messenger.

00:00:11.019 --> 00:00:13.039
I'm here to share the values

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:15.598
my parents have instilled
in my siblings and I,

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:19.009
but they are also the core values
of the business they own today.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.159
My parents are the owners
of R&amp;B Enterprises,

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:26.309
a machining company that has been awarded
Boeing Supplier of the Year three times,

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:29.550
out of the 23,000 businesses
Boeing has worked with.

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:32.170
(Applause)

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:37.000
But it wasn't always like this.

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:40.299
Keep these two words
in the back of your mind

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:43.619
throughout this talk:
risk and determination.

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:46.040
Today, I'm here to speak
on behalf of my parents

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:47.740
to share you their story.

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:51.939
My parents were
among the 2 million people

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:56.468
who escaped Vietnam
after the fall of Saigon in 1975.

00:00:56.469 --> 00:01:01.538
My dad escaped in 1981,
and my mom escaped in 1983.

00:01:01.539 --> 00:01:03.189
The first time my mom escaped,

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:05.518
she was actually caught
and jailed for two weeks

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:08.677
before being able to bribe the guards
with jewelry to set her free.

00:01:08.678 --> 00:01:11.029
My parents,
like a lot of the Vietnamese people,

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:14.489
escaped by fishermen boat,
a lot like this one.

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:18.969
These boats were crammed with people,
sometimes 60 people on the lower end,

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:22.688
but as many as 150 people in some cases.

00:01:22.689 --> 00:01:25.978
This is where the term "boat people"
was derived from.

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:28.949
People were fleeing Vietnam,
because after the fall of Saigon,

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:32.289
South Vietnam faced
a lot of persecution and dangers.

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:35.109
Former government officials, soldiers,

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:38.219
and supporters
of the Vietnamese government,

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:40.219
the Southern Vietnamese government,

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:44.120
were sent to reeducation camps
where they were tortured,

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:48.258
faced hard labor for many years,
and even execution.

00:01:48.259 --> 00:01:51.539
And at a lot of the times,
these executions were carried out

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:54.479
without any formal convictions or trial.

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:56.579
If somebody accused you
of being a supporter

00:01:56.580 --> 00:01:59.749
or of any relationship between
the Southern Vietnamese government,

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:02.828
you were going to be sent
to this reeducation camp.

00:02:02.829 --> 00:02:05.979
An estimated 150,000 people died
in these camps,

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:07.959
so people were fearing for their lives,

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:10.850
so they took the risk
and escaped the country.

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:15.099
While two million people escaped Vietnam,

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:17.939
400,000 people did not make the trip.

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:22.719
My uncle, my mom's brother,
was among the 400,000.

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:26.509
While in Thai waters,
his boat was attacked by pirates

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:28.529
where goods were robbed,

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:30.549
women were raped
and taken as sex slaves,

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:33.918
and then the pirates sank the ship,
leaving the men for dead.

00:02:33.919 --> 00:02:38.699
It's really unfortunate to say
that my uncle's story is not rare.

00:02:38.709 --> 00:02:43.399
Many boats faced pirate attacks,
storms, starvation,

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:46.319
and sometimes,
they were just at sea for so long,

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:48.470
they never made it ashore again.

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:51.409
For people who did make the trip,

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:54.340
they stayed in refugee camps
in neighboring countries

00:02:55.410 --> 00:03:00.328
such as Hong Kong, Thailand, Malaysia,
Indonesia, and the Philippines.

00:03:00.329 --> 00:03:02.329
My dad's boat sailed to Malaysia

00:03:02.334 --> 00:03:05.990
where he stayed in the refugee camp
in Pulau Bidong for a couple months

00:03:05.991 --> 00:03:09.759
before relocating to another
refugee camp within the country.

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:11.849
My mom, who escaped
two years after him,

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:14.168
actually stayed
in the exact same camp as him

00:03:14.169 --> 00:03:16.969
in Pulau Bidong
before resettling to Seattle.

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:20.800
That's Pulau Bidong.

00:03:22.269 --> 00:03:26.569
The Orderly Departure Program,
spanning from 1975 to 1994,

00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:29.619
helped Vietnamese refugees
resettle to Western countries,

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:33.518
with the majority, like my parents,
relocating to the United States,

00:03:33.519 --> 00:03:37.779
and others emigrating over
to European countries and Seattle.

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:41.400
Refugees who had priority
in being relocated,

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:43.949
had family already
in the Western countries.

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:46.380
Because my mom already had
her sisters in Seattle,

00:03:46.389 --> 00:03:48.328
she only stayed in the refugee camps

00:03:48.329 --> 00:03:50.999
for a couple months
before emigrating over.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.840
My dad, on the other hand,
he faced somewhat of a bit --

00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:57.649
he faced some situations.

00:03:57.650 --> 00:04:02.078
Because he didn't have blood relatives
over in any of the countries,

00:04:02.079 --> 00:04:04.649
almost every Western country
rejected him.

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:08.929
He ended up staying in the refugee camps
for two and a half years.

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:11.399
After that, the United States
finally caved

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:13.499
and gave him the thumbs up
to emigrate over.

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:16.019
And he said it was
because he was there for so long,

00:04:16.019 --> 00:04:17.339
they felt bad for him.

00:04:17.339 --> 00:04:18.399
(Laughter)

00:04:18.399 --> 00:04:22.580
So now my dad was in California,
and my mom was in Seattle.

00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:28.289
My dad's uncle helped him enroll
in technical college

00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:31.280
where he pursued machining,
because at the time,

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:35.319
he didn't speak English very well,

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:37.689
so machining didn't require
a lot of speaking,

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:39.629
but a lot of technical skills,

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:42.600
so he thought it was a good suit for him.

00:04:43.730 --> 00:04:46.219
He ended up graduating
top of his class,

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:48.880
scoring a 96% on the final exam

00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:55.520
where the final average was only a 56%.

00:04:56.334 --> 00:04:58.999
My mom, she went
to Ingraham High School in Seattle,

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:02.149
and then went on to graduating
at North Seattle Community College

00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:05.139
and became a certified medical assistant.

00:05:05.140 --> 00:05:10.460
In 1990, when tensions between
the United States and Vietnam eased,

00:05:10.470 --> 00:05:12.489
Vietnamese refugees who escaped

00:05:12.490 --> 00:05:14.840
were able to go back
to Vietnam to visit family.

00:05:14.850 --> 00:05:18.599
During the long flight,
everybody was so nervous,

00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:22.279
and there was a lot of talking,
and-- you know where I'm going.

00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:24.339
(Laughter)

00:05:24.340 --> 00:05:27.620
Yes, my parents
were on the exact same flight,

00:05:27.630 --> 00:05:31.409
and after a little bit of talking,
they found out that their village

00:05:31.410 --> 00:05:34.089
was only 20 minutes away
from one another.

00:05:34.090 --> 00:05:36.319
So, the plane landed,

00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:38.749
and my dad went back
to visit to his family,

00:05:38.750 --> 00:05:41.099
and he decided to pay a little visit

00:05:41.100 --> 00:05:43.699
to my mom and her family in her village.

00:05:43.700 --> 00:05:45.759
And you know what's really cute?

00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:47.699
They booked the same flight back,

00:05:47.700 --> 00:05:49.939
and they managed
a long distance relationship

00:05:49.940 --> 00:05:52.780
and married two years later in 1994.

00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:56.159
Two years after that,
they had their first child,

00:05:56.160 --> 00:05:57.809
and that was me.

00:05:57.810 --> 00:05:59.540
(Laughter)

00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:01.479
So, fast forward,

00:06:01.480 --> 00:06:04.500
after they had my twin brothers,
we decided to move to Seattle

00:06:04.510 --> 00:06:07.760
to be closer
to my mom's intermediate family.

00:06:08.610 --> 00:06:11.089
At the time, my parents
were working both full time,

00:06:11.090 --> 00:06:13.929
my mom as a medical assistant
in the International District,

00:06:13.930 --> 00:06:18.099
and my dad was working
day and night shifts as a machinist.

00:06:18.829 --> 00:06:20.799
After moving between companies,

00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:23.459
he got a job at R&amp;B Enterprises.

00:06:23.460 --> 00:06:28.809
But after a dispute
with an employee, he decided to leave.

00:06:28.810 --> 00:06:31.419
When he was working at R&amp;B, though,

00:06:31.420 --> 00:06:34.819
the owner briefly mentioned about
wanting to sell the business to him.

00:06:34.820 --> 00:06:37.420
But when my dad left,
and after a couple months,

00:06:37.430 --> 00:06:40.719
the owner unexpectedly died of cancer.

00:06:40.720 --> 00:06:42.849
So my dad went back to the son asking

00:06:42.850 --> 00:06:46.019
if he was still willing
to sell the business.

00:06:46.020 --> 00:06:49.839
And R&amp;B Enterprises
was very profitable at the time,

00:06:49.840 --> 00:06:51.459
so the son refused.

00:06:51.460 --> 00:06:54.409
There was no reason to sell the business
that was profitable.

00:06:54.410 --> 00:06:56.530
Fast forward two and a half years later

00:06:56.542 --> 00:06:59.205
and R&amp;B Enterprises
was on the brink of bankruptcy

00:06:59.206 --> 00:07:02.439
and the son finally came back
asking my dad to buy the business.

00:07:02.440 --> 00:07:04.399
And let me add this really quickly.

00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:07.519
My dad really wanted to own a business.

00:07:07.520 --> 00:07:09.019
I remember growing up,

00:07:09.020 --> 00:07:11.579
he would bring home
so many franchise brochures

00:07:11.580 --> 00:07:14.799
because he was actually thinking
about opening up one.

00:07:14.800 --> 00:07:17.560
So, my dad took the opportunity,
took out a mortgage,

00:07:17.570 --> 00:07:20.099
and used it as a down payment
to buy the business.

00:07:20.100 --> 00:07:23.199
And when it was finally his,
he realized how bad it was.

00:07:23.200 --> 00:07:25.259
(Laughter)

00:07:25.260 --> 00:07:27.709
The previous owners
was so behind in production

00:07:27.710 --> 00:07:30.049
that the phones were ringing
off the hook.

00:07:30.050 --> 00:07:31.739
And on the other line,

00:07:31.740 --> 00:07:34.119
angry customers were threatening to sue.

00:07:34.120 --> 00:07:37.079
But my dad apologized,
explained the situation,

00:07:37.080 --> 00:07:40.019
and strategized the best plan
to start production.

00:07:40.020 --> 00:07:42.119
Within two weeks, the phone calls stopped,

00:07:42.120 --> 00:07:44.679
and that's because product
started leaving the shop

00:07:44.680 --> 00:07:46.220
and into customer hands.

00:07:47.580 --> 00:07:51.159
My dad was working 20 hours a day,
seven days a week,

00:07:51.160 --> 00:07:54.549
and my mom was working full time
as a medical assistant

00:07:54.550 --> 00:07:59.019
and still was helping him at the shop
while juggling to raise us kids.

00:07:59.020 --> 00:08:01.769
My parents bought the business in 2008,

00:08:01.770 --> 00:08:03.880
and that's when the recession hit.

00:08:04.900 --> 00:08:06.740
Bad luck, right?

00:08:07.920 --> 00:08:10.679
So, you remember
how bad the recession was.

00:08:10.680 --> 00:08:14.959
Houses were up for foreclosure;
small businesses were closing.

00:08:14.960 --> 00:08:18.839
But R&amp;B Enterprises was still in business.

00:08:18.840 --> 00:08:22.760
It was actually increasing 10 to 15%
every single year,

00:08:22.770 --> 00:08:25.569
and that's because the businesses
my dad was working with

00:08:25.570 --> 00:08:27.638
was spreading word to other businesses

00:08:27.639 --> 00:08:32.350
that R&amp;B Enterprises
was never short on projects or jobs.

00:08:33.320 --> 00:08:36.197
My parents were able to pay
any accumulated debt

00:08:36.198 --> 00:08:40.168
in three years' time,
and in 2012, they were awarded

00:08:40.169 --> 00:08:43.519
Boeing Supplier of the Year
for the first time.

00:08:43.520 --> 00:08:47.299
In 2013, they were awarded another award.

00:08:47.300 --> 00:08:49.940
And in 2014, they won

00:08:49.950 --> 00:08:53.299
another Boeing Supplier of the Year Award.

00:08:53.300 --> 00:08:56.745
And my parents are pretty confident
they're going to win again this year.

00:08:56.746 --> 00:08:58.169
(Laughter)

00:08:58.170 --> 00:08:59.910
(Applause)

00:09:06.230 --> 00:09:09.739
This Vietnamese boy who didn't even
have a high school diploma

00:09:09.740 --> 00:09:14.070
managed to climb his way up
to be a successful business owner.

00:09:15.330 --> 00:09:18.699
My parents, after going through
what they've been through,

00:09:18.700 --> 00:09:20.240
they never gave up.

00:09:21.070 --> 00:09:24.989
At the beginning of this talk, I told you
to remember these two words:

00:09:24.990 --> 00:09:26.740
risk and determination.

00:09:27.380 --> 00:09:31.739
Those are the two values my parents
have taught my siblings and I,

00:09:31.740 --> 00:09:35.338
and they're also the core values
of their business.

00:09:35.339 --> 00:09:38.259
My parents risked their lives
to come to this country

00:09:38.260 --> 00:09:40.459
in hopes of a better one,

00:09:40.460 --> 00:09:43.439
not knowing whether or not
they were going to make the trip.

00:09:43.440 --> 00:09:47.140
Once here, despite of
the language barriers and obstacles,

00:09:47.150 --> 00:09:50.619
they were determined
to make a living for themselves.

00:09:50.620 --> 00:09:55.579
Furthermore, R&amp;B Enterprises
focuses on prototyping,

00:09:55.580 --> 00:09:57.519
one of the riskiest specialties to be in

00:09:57.520 --> 00:10:00.519
because of the increased rate of failure.

00:10:00.520 --> 00:10:04.079
Sometimes, projects
just didn't go as planned.

00:10:04.080 --> 00:10:07.259
Final products just didn't fit
in the machine right.

00:10:07.260 --> 00:10:09.339
But my dad never gave up.

00:10:09.340 --> 00:10:11.839
He didn't give up when others would've.

00:10:11.840 --> 00:10:15.640
And he would spend countless hours
at the shop or at home

00:10:15.649 --> 00:10:18.010
until the final product was perfect.

00:10:19.150 --> 00:10:21.019
Being a child to Vietnamese parents

00:10:21.020 --> 00:10:23.539
that have gone through
what they've been through,

00:10:23.540 --> 00:10:26.559
the values they have taught me
is prominent in my everyday life.

00:10:26.560 --> 00:10:30.239
My parents are my best friends,
so I come to them for everything:

00:10:30.240 --> 00:10:34.539
life problems, school problems,
or just doubts in general.

00:10:34.540 --> 00:10:37.309
And they always say
the same thing over and over,

00:10:37.310 --> 00:10:41.119
and this is my mom's favorite saying,

00:10:41.120 --> 00:10:43.730
"If you think you can, you can."

00:10:44.460 --> 00:10:46.439
Sometimes,

00:10:46.440 --> 00:10:49.919
your goal is just going to be risky,
but you just have to be determined.

00:10:49.920 --> 00:10:52.979
Sometimes the path to your goal
is going to be short,

00:10:52.980 --> 00:10:57.459
but oftentimes, you're going to have
to take a detour.

00:10:57.460 --> 00:10:58.758
Be determined;

00:10:58.759 --> 00:11:01.898
and sometimes, your goal
is going to be risky.

00:11:01.899 --> 00:11:03.819
But my dad always says,

00:11:03.820 --> 00:11:06.320
"You miss 100%
of the risks you don't take."

00:11:09.180 --> 00:11:12.800
So, risk and determination;
those are the two things

00:11:12.810 --> 00:11:16.119
my parents and I want you
to take away from this talk.

00:11:16.120 --> 00:11:17.469
Thank you.

00:11:17.470 --> 00:11:19.050
(Applause)
