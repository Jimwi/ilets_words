1
00:00:04,870 --> 00:00:11,010
This small room brings together works of art made in the years 1914 and 1915 and so inevitably

2
00:00:11,010 --> 00:00:16,660
heavily reflects the impact of the First World War that started in the autumn of 1914.

3
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:29,680
Typical is this work by Jacob Epstein called ‘Torso from the Rock Drill’.

4
00:00:29,680 --> 00:00:35,680
The Rock Drill was an extraordinary huge sculpture in which a plaster mechanised robot like figure

5
00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:39,240
sat on top of an enormous miner’s drill.

6
00:00:40,340 --> 00:00:44,800
By 1915 Epstein was so disillusioned by the war

7
00:00:45,129 --> 00:00:49,389
that he couldn't bear the sight of this image of mechanised destruction and

8
00:00:49,389 --> 00:00:54,689
he took the figure down and cut it in half, making it this much more ambiguous image

9
00:00:54,700 --> 00:00:57,580
with this helmeted machine like head

10
00:00:57,580 --> 00:01:03,800
and yet within its torso a small embryo, an image of hopeful renewal in the future.

11
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:13,560
David Bomberg’s ‘The Mud Bath’ is one of the great paintings of Twentieth Century British art.

12
00:01:13,580 --> 00:01:20,960
It was based on drawings he made at a steam baths in the East End, then a very strongly Jewish part of London

13
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:27,000
and you can see these figures about to dive into the waters or half submerged in the pool.

14
00:01:28,620 --> 00:01:32,820
The colours surely refer to the Union Flag

15
00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:39,320
and of course the title 'The Mud Bath' now shows a weird sort of `prescience` in that within months

16
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:45,300
so many millions of men would be caught in the mud bath of the trenches in Northern France and Belgium.

17
00:01:52,920 --> 00:02:00,860
This painting by Walter Sickert made in 1915 shows a seaside vaudeville act on the Brighton sea front.

18
00:02:00,980 --> 00:02:07,960
It's a rather melancholy scene and not one which obviously indicates the war that is going on around it

19
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,660
and yet if we look closely we see the deck chairs are mostly empty

20
00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:20,240
and there is this rather ominous glowing sunset in the west, a sense of a dying culture perhaps.

21
00:02:21,100 --> 00:02:26,960
It seems to continue Sickert’s fascination with the music hall and yet I think within it is

22
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:32,460
this sort of sense of the melancholy that infected Britain during the First World War.
