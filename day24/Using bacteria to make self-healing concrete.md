1
00:00:03,720 --> 00:00:07,600
Concrete is the most important
of all our construction materials.

2
00:00:07,700 --> 00:00:11,460
It's the most widely used material
on earth, after water.

3
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:15,240
If concrete has one flaw, it's that
it has low tensile strength,

4
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:19,020
and therefore we need to add steel,
to make reinforced concrete.

5
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:23,340
And in turn, the concrete needs to 
protect the steel from corrosion.

6
00:00:23,340 --> 00:00:25,336
However, should the concrete crack,

7
00:00:25,336 --> 00:00:28,856
then that provides a pathway
for harmful substances

8
00:00:28,856 --> 00:00:32,796
such as chlorides, carbon dioxide,
and ultimately oxygen and water,

9
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:34,660
to get to the reinforcing steel,

10
00:00:34,660 --> 00:00:37,000
cause corrosion, cause rust,

11
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,360
and that ultimately leads to
destruction of the concrete.

12
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:44,460
The cracking of concrete is a problem

13
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:48,400
because of the need for repair, 
which can be terribly expensive –

14
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:50,420
imagine motorway bridges, for example.

15
00:00:50,420 --> 00:00:54,820
So here at the University of Bath,
we're working in collaboration

16
00:00:54,820 --> 00:00:59,260
with the Universities of Cambridge
and Cardiff, all funded by EPSRC,

17
00:00:59,260 --> 00:01:02,080
looking at self-healing concrete.

18
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:05,980
We are trying to seal cracks as they form

19
00:01:05,980 --> 00:01:09,560
using bacteria which are able to produce limestone.

20
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:11,040
Remarkable.

21
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:14,240
And if we can incorporate those into the cracks

22
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:16,320
or around the cracks that will form,

23
00:01:16,669 --> 00:01:19,749
the limestone will then plug those gaps.

24
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:22,360
Concrete is a very hostile environment,

25
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:23,740
and the bacteria which fit the bill

26
00:01:23,740 --> 00:01:25,640
can survive in this hostile environment,

27
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:28,920
of high alkaline pH and produce
limestone at the same time.

28
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:32,960
These are the three bacterial cultures which we are working with right now in the lab

29
00:01:32,964 --> 00:01:36,044
and they perfectly grow in alkaline conditions.

30
00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:39,400
That is what makes them suitable
for their use in concrete,

31
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:41,700
and here you can see they have grown
in a liquid culture medium

32
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:42,800
which is alkaline.

33
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:46,520
It looks cloudy, which indicates that the bacteria
are growing in this medium.

34
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:50,460
These bacteria are now in a medium
which contains calcium,

35
00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:53,660
and in the presence of calcium and
carbon dioxide they produce limestone,

36
00:01:53,660 --> 00:01:55,600
which is calcium carbonate.

37
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:58,620
The cracks in concrete are then impregnated

38
00:01:58,620 --> 00:02:00,320
with bacteria and bacterial food

39
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:02,000
which contains calcium,

40
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,840
and these bacteria have used this calcium
with carbon dioxide

41
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:06,380
to precipitate calcite,

42
00:02:06,380 --> 00:02:09,160
and you can see that the crack has been
healed by the bacteria.

43
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:13,360
If we could have a self-healing concrete,
that would alleviate the need for repair,

44
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:15,840
which would save considerable
amounts of money.

45
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:18,000
But it would also have an environmental saving –

46
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,440
if you remember how much concrete we make,

47
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:22,960
the amount of cement we need to make that concrete

48
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:28,220
contributes between 5-7% of carbon dioxide emissions.

49
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:30,840
So any concrete that we don't need to make

50
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:34,260
reduces the CO2 emissions produced by this industry.

51
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:37,080
Bacteria wouldn't survive the harsh conditions

52
00:02:37,083 --> 00:02:39,061
and the manufacture of concrete.

53
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:42,880
So we've chosen bacteria that produce spores.

54
00:02:43,293 --> 00:02:45,773
These are long-lived, really tough –

55
00:02:45,773 --> 00:02:48,153
last 100 years in some species.

56
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:51,200
So, we know how to turn them on in culture,

57
00:02:51,770 --> 00:02:54,020
we can produce them in bulk,

58
00:02:54,020 --> 00:02:56,500
and they've got to go into concrete.

59
00:02:57,780 --> 00:03:03,360
The problem is, they probably need protection
in some form of capsule.

60
00:03:04,758 --> 00:03:07,298
And we're producing various things

61
00:03:07,780 --> 00:03:11,140
to protect them from the
crushing of the concrete,

62
00:03:11,380 --> 00:03:13,340
that will keep the bacteria and the food separate,

63
00:03:13,340 --> 00:03:17,060
and will crack or dissolve when the crack forms

64
00:03:17,068 --> 00:03:20,168
to release those, to produce the limestone.

65
00:03:21,780 --> 00:03:25,860
We're hoping to carry out trials of this
self-healing concrete in November.

66
00:03:25,860 --> 00:03:28,720
In the long term, we anticipate self-healing concrete

67
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:32,750
being a specialist material that can be used in
many important structures,

68
00:03:32,750 --> 00:03:34,790
particularly underground structures
or underwater structures,

69
00:03:34,790 --> 00:03:37,320
where simply repair isn't an option.

70
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:40,160
And we hope that self-healing concrete will be
a very important material

71
00:03:40,163 --> 00:03:43,203
for the construction industry in the years to come.
