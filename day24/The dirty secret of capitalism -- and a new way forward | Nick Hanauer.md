00:00:13.458 --> 00:00:16.125
I am a capitalist,

00:00:17.458 --> 00:00:20.393
and after a 30-year career in capitalism

00:00:20.417 --> 00:00:22.934
spanning three dozen companies,

00:00:22.958 --> 00:00:26.309
generating tens of billions
of dollars in market value,

00:00:26.333 --> 00:00:32.208
I'm not just in the top one percent,
I'm in the top .01 percent of all earners.

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:36.518
Today, I have come
to share the secrets of our success,

00:00:36.542 --> 00:00:40.726
because rich capitalists like me
have never been richer.

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:43.375
So the question is, how do we do it?

00:00:44.292 --> 00:00:45.851
How do we manage to grab

00:00:45.875 --> 00:00:49.708
an ever-increasing share
of the economic pie every year?

00:00:50.875 --> 00:00:54.792
Is it that rich people are smarter
than we were 30 years ago?

00:00:55.833 --> 00:00:58.208
Is it that we're working harder
than we once did?

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:02.000
Are we taller, better looking?

00:01:03.292 --> 00:01:04.542
Sadly, no.

00:01:05.542 --> 00:01:08.143
It all comes down to just one thing:

00:01:08.167 --> 00:01:09.417
economics.

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:11.822
Because, here's the dirty secret.

00:01:12.667 --> 00:01:15.018
There was a time
in which the economics profession

00:01:15.042 --> 00:01:16.518
worked in the public interest,

00:01:16.542 --> 00:01:18.434
but in the neoliberal era,

00:01:18.458 --> 00:01:20.184
today,

00:01:20.208 --> 00:01:22.643
they work only for big corporations

00:01:22.667 --> 00:01:24.226
and billionaires,

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:26.833
and that is creating
a little bit of a problem.

00:01:27.792 --> 00:01:31.601
We could choose to enact economic policies

00:01:31.625 --> 00:01:33.500
that raise taxes on the rich,

00:01:34.417 --> 00:01:38.268
regulate powerful corporations
or raise wages for workers.

00:01:38.292 --> 00:01:39.809
We have done it before.

00:01:39.833 --> 00:01:42.309
But neoliberal economists would warn

00:01:42.333 --> 00:01:46.351
that all of these policies
would be a terrible mistake,

00:01:46.375 --> 00:01:49.125
because raising taxes
always kills economic growth,

00:01:50.083 --> 00:01:52.351
and any form of government regulation

00:01:52.375 --> 00:01:54.059
is inefficient,

00:01:54.083 --> 00:01:56.458
and raising wages always kills jobs.

00:01:57.375 --> 00:01:59.458
Well, as a `consequence` of that thinking,

00:02:00.542 --> 00:02:04.768
over the last 30 years, in the USA alone,

00:02:04.792 --> 00:02:09.059
the top one percent has grown
21 trillion dollars richer

00:02:09.083 --> 00:02:14.518
while the bottom 50 percent
have grown 900 billion dollars poorer,

00:02:14.542 --> 00:02:18.434
a pattern of widening inequality
that has largely repeated itself

00:02:18.458 --> 00:02:19.934
across the world.

00:02:19.958 --> 00:02:24.601
And yet, as middle class families
struggle to get by

00:02:24.625 --> 00:02:28.518
on wages that have not budged
in about 40 years,

00:02:28.542 --> 00:02:32.684
neoliberal economists continue to warn
that the only reasonable response

00:02:32.708 --> 00:02:36.809
to the painful dislocations
of austerity and globalization

00:02:36.833 --> 00:02:39.625
is even more austerity and globalization.

00:02:40.708 --> 00:02:43.625
So, what is a society to do?

00:02:44.833 --> 00:02:47.726
Well, it's super clear to me
what we need to do.

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:49.667
We need a new economics.

00:02:51.167 --> 00:02:55.226
So, economics has been described
as the dismal science,

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:58.351
and for good reason,
because as much as it is taught today,

00:02:58.375 --> 00:02:59.976
it isn't a science at all,

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.393
in spite of all
of the dazzling mathematics.

00:03:03.417 --> 00:03:06.601
In fact, a growing number
of academics and practitioners

00:03:06.625 --> 00:03:12.601
have concluded that neoliberal
economic theory is dangerously wrong

00:03:12.625 --> 00:03:16.226
and that today's growing crises
of rising inequality

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:17.934
and growing political instability

00:03:17.958 --> 00:03:23.143
are the direct result
of decades of bad economic theory.

00:03:23.167 --> 00:03:29.143
What we now know is that the economics
that made me so rich isn't just wrong,

00:03:29.167 --> 00:03:31.184
it's backwards,

00:03:31.208 --> 00:03:33.143
because it turns out

00:03:33.167 --> 00:03:36.934
it isn't capital
that creates economic growth,

00:03:36.958 --> 00:03:38.208
it's people;

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:44.018
and it isn't self-interest
that promotes the public good,

00:03:44.042 --> 00:03:45.292
it's reciprocity;

00:03:46.542 --> 00:03:50.809
and it isn't competition
that produces our prosperity,

00:03:50.833 --> 00:03:52.458
it's cooperation.

00:03:53.333 --> 00:03:58.351
What we can now see is that an economics
that is neither just nor inclusive

00:03:58.375 --> 00:04:02.768
can never sustain the high levels
of social cooperation

00:04:02.792 --> 00:04:05.434
necessary to enable
a modern society to thrive.

00:04:05.458 --> 00:04:08.042
So where did we go wrong?

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:13.434
Well, it turns out
that it's become painfully obvious

00:04:13.458 --> 00:04:19.476
that the fundamental assumptions
that undergird neoliberal economic theory

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:22.601
are just objectively false,

00:04:22.625 --> 00:04:26.434
and so today first I want to take you
through some of those mistaken assumptions

00:04:26.458 --> 00:04:32.500
and then after describe where the science
suggests prosperity actually comes from.

00:04:33.416 --> 00:04:37.559
So, neoliberal economic
assumption number one is

00:04:37.583 --> 00:04:42.018
that the market is
an efficient equilibrium system,

00:04:42.042 --> 00:04:48.059
which basically means that if one thing
in the economy, like wages, goes up,

00:04:48.083 --> 00:04:52.250
another thing in the economy,
like jobs, must go down.

00:04:53.333 --> 00:04:55.708
So for example, in Seattle, where I live,

00:04:56.958 --> 00:05:01.976
when in 2014 we passed
our nation's first 15 dollar minimum wage,

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:06.417
the neoliberals freaked out
over their precious equilibrium.

00:05:07.375 --> 00:05:10.226
"If you raise the price
of labor," they warned,

00:05:10.250 --> 00:05:12.268
"businesses will purchase less of it.

00:05:12.292 --> 00:05:14.809
Thousands of low-wage workers
will lose their jobs.

00:05:14.833 --> 00:05:16.726
The restaurants will close."

00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:18.000
Except ...

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:20.250
they didn't.

00:05:20.917 --> 00:05:24.125
The unemployment rate fell dramatically.

00:05:25.125 --> 00:05:28.018
The restaurant business in Seattle boomed.

00:05:28.042 --> 00:05:29.292
Why?

00:05:30.083 --> 00:05:32.500
Because there is no equilibrium.

00:05:33.917 --> 00:05:36.726
Because raising wages
doesn't kill jobs, it creates them;

00:05:36.750 --> 00:05:38.226
because, for instance,

00:05:38.250 --> 00:05:43.143
when restaurant owners are suddenly
required to pay restaurant workers enough

00:05:43.167 --> 00:05:47.184
so that now even they
can afford to eat in restaurants,

00:05:47.208 --> 00:05:49.226
it doesn't shrink the restaurant business,

00:05:49.250 --> 00:05:51.458
it grows it, obviously.

00:05:53.333 --> 00:05:54.601
(Applause)

00:05:54.625 --> 00:05:56.042
Thank you.

00:05:58.208 --> 00:06:00.458
The second assumption is

00:06:01.917 --> 00:06:06.893
that the price of something
is always equal to its value,

00:06:06.917 --> 00:06:10.476
which basically means
that if you earn 50,000 dollars a year

00:06:10.500 --> 00:06:13.434
and I earn 50 million dollars a year,

00:06:13.458 --> 00:06:17.750
that's because I produce
a thousand times as much value as you.

00:06:18.583 --> 00:06:20.226
Now,

00:06:20.250 --> 00:06:23.893
it will not surprise you to learn

00:06:23.917 --> 00:06:25.893
that this is a very comforting assumption

00:06:25.917 --> 00:06:28.601
if you're a CEO paying yourself
50 million dollars a year

00:06:28.625 --> 00:06:31.559
but paying your workers poverty wages.

00:06:31.583 --> 00:06:35.726
But please, take it from somebody
who has run dozens of businesses:

00:06:35.750 --> 00:06:38.143
this is nonsense.

00:06:38.167 --> 00:06:40.559
People are not paid what they are worth.

00:06:40.583 --> 00:06:43.851
They are paid what they have
the power to negotiate,

00:06:43.875 --> 00:06:46.643
and wages' falling share of GDP

00:06:46.667 --> 00:06:50.184
is not because workers
have become less productive

00:06:50.208 --> 00:06:53.375
but because employers
have become more powerful.

00:06:54.333 --> 00:06:55.601
And --

00:06:55.625 --> 00:06:57.208
(Applause)

00:06:59.167 --> 00:07:04.643
And by pretending that the giant imbalance
in power between capital and labor

00:07:04.667 --> 00:07:06.309
doesn't exist,

00:07:06.333 --> 00:07:10.059
neoliberal economic theory
became essentially

00:07:10.083 --> 00:07:12.333
a protection racket for the rich.

00:07:13.500 --> 00:07:16.018
The third assumption,
and by far the most pernicious,

00:07:16.042 --> 00:07:17.351
is a behavioral model

00:07:17.375 --> 00:07:21.226
that describes human beings
as something called "homo economicus,"

00:07:21.250 --> 00:07:26.476
which basically means
that we are all perfectly selfish,

00:07:26.500 --> 00:07:30.500
perfectly rational
and relentlessly self-maximizing.

00:07:31.958 --> 00:07:33.559
But just ask yourselves,

00:07:33.583 --> 00:07:37.393
is it plausible that every single time
for your entire life,

00:07:37.417 --> 00:07:39.601
when you did something
nice for somebody else,

00:07:39.625 --> 00:07:42.893
all you were doing
was maximizing your own utility?

00:07:42.917 --> 00:07:46.768
Is it plausible that when a soldier jumps
on a grenade to defend fellow soldiers,

00:07:46.792 --> 00:07:49.518
they're just promoting
their narrow self-interest?

00:07:49.542 --> 00:07:51.351
If you think that's nuts,

00:07:51.375 --> 00:07:54.476
contrary to any reasonable
`moral` `intuition`,

00:07:54.500 --> 00:07:56.309
that's because it is

00:07:56.333 --> 00:07:58.101
and, according to the latest science,

00:07:58.125 --> 00:07:59.768
not true.

00:07:59.792 --> 00:08:02.309
But it is this behavioral model

00:08:02.333 --> 00:08:05.601
which is at the cold, cruel heart
of neoliberal economics,

00:08:05.625 --> 00:08:09.309
and it is as morally corrosive

00:08:09.333 --> 00:08:11.851
as it is scientifically wrong

00:08:11.875 --> 00:08:16.934
because, if we accept at face value

00:08:16.958 --> 00:08:19.768
that humans are fundamentally selfish,

00:08:19.792 --> 00:08:22.018
and then we look around the world

00:08:22.042 --> 00:08:25.042
at all of the unambiguous
prosperity in it,

00:08:26.083 --> 00:08:28.934
then it follows logically,

00:08:28.958 --> 00:08:30.768
then it must be true by definition,

00:08:30.792 --> 00:08:34.643
that billions of individual
acts of selfishness

00:08:34.667 --> 00:08:38.684
magically transubstantiate
into prosperity and the common good.

00:08:38.708 --> 00:08:41.601
If we humans are merely
selfish maximizers,

00:08:41.625 --> 00:08:45.207
then selfishness
is the cause of our prosperity.

00:08:46.125 --> 00:08:48.726
Under this economic logic,

00:08:48.750 --> 00:08:50.707
greed is good,

00:08:51.667 --> 00:08:54.018
widening inequality is efficient,

00:08:54.042 --> 00:08:56.393
and the only purpose of the corporation

00:08:56.417 --> 00:08:58.893
can be to enrich shareholders,

00:08:58.917 --> 00:09:02.018
because to do otherwise
would be to slow economic growth

00:09:02.042 --> 00:09:03.833
and harm the economy overall.

00:09:05.333 --> 00:09:08.726
And it is this gospel of selfishness

00:09:08.750 --> 00:09:12.976
which forms the ideological cornerstone
of neoliberal economics,

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:16.643
a way of thinking
which has produced economic policies

00:09:16.667 --> 00:09:20.393
which have enabled me and my rich buddies
in the top one percent

00:09:20.417 --> 00:09:24.375
to grab virtually all of the benefits
of growth over the last 40 years.

00:09:25.083 --> 00:09:26.934
But,

00:09:26.958 --> 00:09:29.018
if instead

00:09:29.042 --> 00:09:32.684
we accept the latest empirical research,

00:09:32.708 --> 00:09:36.059
real science, which correctly
describes human beings

00:09:36.083 --> 00:09:39.268
as highly cooperative,

00:09:39.292 --> 00:09:40.559
reciprocal

00:09:40.583 --> 00:09:43.518
and intuitively moral creatures,

00:09:43.542 --> 00:09:46.184
then it follows logically

00:09:46.208 --> 00:09:48.726
that it must be cooperation

00:09:48.750 --> 00:09:50.351
and not selfishness

00:09:50.375 --> 00:09:52.143
that is the cause of our prosperity,

00:09:52.167 --> 00:09:54.518
and it isn't our self-interest

00:09:54.542 --> 00:09:57.167
but rather our inherent reciprocity

00:09:58.250 --> 00:10:01.083
that is humanity's economic superpower.

00:10:01.833 --> 00:10:06.309
So at the heart of this new economics

00:10:06.333 --> 00:10:11.101
is a story about ourselves that grants us
permission to be our best selves,

00:10:11.125 --> 00:10:14.101
and, unlike the old economics,

00:10:14.125 --> 00:10:16.851
this is a story that is virtuous

00:10:16.875 --> 00:10:19.708
and also has the virtue of being true.

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:22.893
Now,

00:10:22.917 --> 00:10:25.101
I want to emphasize
that this new economics

00:10:25.125 --> 00:10:27.768
is not something I have personally
imagined or invented.

00:10:27.792 --> 00:10:30.601
Its theories and models
are being developed and refined

00:10:30.625 --> 00:10:32.643
in universities around the world

00:10:32.667 --> 00:10:35.976
building on some of the best
new research in economics,

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:37.893
complexity theory, evolutionary theory,

00:10:37.917 --> 00:10:41.018
psychology, anthropology
and other disciplines.

00:10:41.042 --> 00:10:45.851
And although this new economics
does not yet have its own textbook

00:10:45.875 --> 00:10:48.226
or even a commonly agreed upon name,

00:10:48.250 --> 00:10:50.268
in broad strokes

00:10:50.292 --> 00:10:54.458
its explanation of where prosperity
comes from goes something like this.

00:10:55.458 --> 00:11:00.018
So, market capitalism
is an evolutionary system

00:11:00.042 --> 00:11:02.476
in which prosperity emerges

00:11:02.500 --> 00:11:04.059
through a positive feedback loop

00:11:04.083 --> 00:11:09.018
between increasing amounts of innovation
and increasing amounts of consumer demand.

00:11:09.042 --> 00:11:13.667
Innovation is the process
by which we solve human problems,

00:11:14.583 --> 00:11:17.893
consumer demand is the mechanism
through which the market selects

00:11:17.917 --> 00:11:20.309
for useful innovations,

00:11:20.333 --> 00:11:23.559
and as we solve more problems,
we become more prosperous.

00:11:23.583 --> 00:11:27.559
But as we become more prosperous,

00:11:27.583 --> 00:11:29.393
our problems and solutions

00:11:29.417 --> 00:11:32.184
become more complex,

00:11:32.208 --> 00:11:35.351
and this increasing technical complexity

00:11:35.375 --> 00:11:39.893
requires ever higher levels
of social and economic cooperation

00:11:39.917 --> 00:11:42.809
in order to produce
the more highly specialized products

00:11:42.833 --> 00:11:47.125
that define a modern economy.

00:11:48.042 --> 00:11:52.726
Now, the old economics
is correct, of course,

00:11:52.750 --> 00:11:56.309
that competition plays a crucial role
in how markets work,

00:11:56.333 --> 00:11:58.434
but what it fails to see

00:11:58.458 --> 00:12:03.143
is that it is largely a competition
between highly cooperative groups --

00:12:03.167 --> 00:12:07.934
competition between firms,
competition between networks of firms,

00:12:07.958 --> 00:12:10.643
competition between nations --

00:12:10.667 --> 00:12:14.559
and anyone who has ever run
a successful business knows

00:12:14.583 --> 00:12:18.333
that building a cooperative team
by including the talents of everyone

00:12:19.792 --> 00:12:24.208
is almost always a better strategy
than just a bunch of selfish jerks.

00:12:25.417 --> 00:12:30.250
So how do we leave neoliberalism behind

00:12:32.458 --> 00:12:35.917
and build a more sustainable,
more prosperous

00:12:37.042 --> 00:12:40.018
and more equitable society?

00:12:40.042 --> 00:12:43.542
The new economics suggests
just five rules of thumb.

00:12:44.042 --> 00:12:50.583
First is that successful economies
are not jungles, they're gardens,

00:12:51.667 --> 00:12:55.351
which is to say that markets,

00:12:55.375 --> 00:12:58.167
like gardens, must be tended,

00:12:59.208 --> 00:13:03.934
that the market is the greatest
social technology ever invented

00:13:03.958 --> 00:13:05.434
for solving human problems,

00:13:05.458 --> 00:13:10.643
but `unconstrained` by social `norms`
or democratic regulation,

00:13:10.667 --> 00:13:14.018
markets inevitably create
more problems than they solve.

00:13:14.042 --> 00:13:15.309
Climate change,

00:13:15.333 --> 00:13:17.309
the great financial crisis of 2008

00:13:17.333 --> 00:13:19.042
are two easy examples.

00:13:19.500 --> 00:13:22.976
The second rule is

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:27.000
that inclusion creates economic growth.

00:13:28.208 --> 00:13:30.768
So the neoliberal idea

00:13:30.792 --> 00:13:33.393
that inclusion is this fancy luxury

00:13:33.417 --> 00:13:37.917
to be afforded if and when we have growth
is both wrong and backwards.

00:13:39.208 --> 00:13:41.667
The economy is people.

00:13:42.667 --> 00:13:44.726
Including more people in more ways

00:13:44.750 --> 00:13:48.792
is what causes economic growth
in market economies.

00:13:49.875 --> 00:13:51.934
The third principle

00:13:51.958 --> 00:13:58.143
is the purpose of the corporation
is not merely to enrich shareholders.

00:13:58.167 --> 00:14:01.934
The greatest grift
in contemporary economic life

00:14:01.958 --> 00:14:04.934
is the neoliberal idea that
the only purpose of the corporation

00:14:04.958 --> 00:14:07.851
and the only responsibility of executives

00:14:07.875 --> 00:14:10.958
is to enrich themselves and shareholders.

00:14:11.958 --> 00:14:17.393
The new economics must and can insist

00:14:17.417 --> 00:14:19.143
that the purpose of the corporation

00:14:19.167 --> 00:14:22.059
is to improve the welfare
of all stakeholders:

00:14:22.083 --> 00:14:24.309
customers, workers,

00:14:24.333 --> 00:14:26.417
community and shareholders alike.

00:14:28.208 --> 00:14:30.226
Rule four:

00:14:30.250 --> 00:14:32.458
greed is not good.

00:14:34.583 --> 00:14:38.351
Being rapacious
doesn't make you a capitalist,

00:14:38.375 --> 00:14:40.434
it makes you a sociopath.

00:14:40.458 --> 00:14:42.893
(Laughter)

00:14:42.917 --> 00:14:47.018
(Applause)

00:14:47.042 --> 00:14:52.226
And in an economy as dependent
upon cooperation at scale as ours,

00:14:52.250 --> 00:14:56.375
sociopathy is as bad for business
as it is for society.

00:14:57.375 --> 00:14:58.625
And fifth and finally,

00:15:00.250 --> 00:15:02.667
unlike the laws of physics,

00:15:03.833 --> 00:15:07.375
the laws of economics are a choice.

00:15:08.542 --> 00:15:10.226
Now, neoliberal economic theory

00:15:10.250 --> 00:15:15.268
has sold itself to you
as unchangeable natural law,

00:15:15.292 --> 00:15:19.184
when in fact it's social norms
and constructed narratives

00:15:19.208 --> 00:15:20.667
based on pseudoscience.

00:15:21.917 --> 00:15:25.434
If we truly want a more equitable,

00:15:25.458 --> 00:15:28.976
more prosperous
and more sustainable economy,

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:31.726
if we want high-functioning democracies

00:15:31.750 --> 00:15:33.976
and civil society,

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:36.000
we must have a new economics.

00:15:36.792 --> 00:15:38.768
And here's the good news:

00:15:38.792 --> 00:15:40.851
if we want a new economics,

00:15:40.875 --> 00:15:44.768
all we have to do is choose to have it.

00:15:44.792 --> 00:15:46.059
Thank you.

00:15:46.083 --> 00:15:51.042
(Applause)

00:16:03.708 --> 00:16:06.875
Moderator: So Nick,
I'm sure you get this question a lot.

00:16:08.333 --> 00:16:11.434
If you're so unhappy
with the economic system,

00:16:11.458 --> 00:16:16.184
why not just give all your money away
and join the 99 percent?

00:16:16.208 --> 00:16:18.976
Nick Hanauer: Yeah, no, yes, right.

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:20.934
You get that a lot. You get that a lot.

00:16:20.958 --> 00:16:23.684
"If you care so much about taxes,
why don't you pay more,

00:16:23.708 --> 00:16:26.601
and if you care so much about wages,
why don't you pay more?"

00:16:26.625 --> 00:16:27.917
And I could do that.

00:16:29.083 --> 00:16:30.601
The problem is,

00:16:30.625 --> 00:16:32.434
it doesn't make that much difference,

00:16:32.458 --> 00:16:34.018
and I have discovered a strategy

00:16:34.042 --> 00:16:36.976
that works literally
a hundred thousand times better --

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:38.268
Moderator: OK.

00:16:38.292 --> 00:16:41.851
NH: which is to use my money
to build narratives and to pass laws

00:16:41.875 --> 00:16:43.934
that will require
all the other rich people

00:16:43.958 --> 00:16:46.018
to pay taxes and pay their workers better.

00:16:46.042 --> 00:16:47.851
(Applause)

00:16:47.875 --> 00:16:49.226
And so, for example,

00:16:49.250 --> 00:16:52.601
the 15-dollar minimum wage
that we cooked up

00:16:52.625 --> 00:16:54.601
has now affected 30 million workers.

00:16:54.625 --> 00:16:55.893
So that works better.

00:16:55.917 --> 00:16:57.184
Moderator: That's great.

00:16:57.208 --> 00:16:59.851
If you change your mind,
we'll find some takers for you.

00:16:59.875 --> 00:17:02.333
NH: OK. Thank you.
Moderator: Thank you very much.
