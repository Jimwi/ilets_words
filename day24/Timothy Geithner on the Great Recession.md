00:00:01.390 --> 00:00:04.140
Ezra Klein: Why should we feel like we did
a good job responding to the financial crisis

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:08.149
despite the fact that today unemployment is
still a whole lot higher than anyone would

00:00:08.149 --> 00:00:08.509
like it to be?
Tim Geithner: This was a classic financial

00:00:08.509 --> 00:00:14.079
panic, the most dangerous type of financial
crisis and something that hadn't happened

00:00:14.079 --> 00:00:18.529
to the world in really almost a hundred years.
If you look at what happened in the Great

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:24.369
Depression, when you look at what happened
around history, this is devastating. In the

00:00:24.369 --> 00:00:31.329
Great Depression, you had a shock to wealth,
GDP fell 25 percent, unemployment went to

00:00:31.329 --> 00:00:37.530
25 percent, and it took 10 years to get back
to a place where roughly like where we are

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:39.210
today.
Our crisis was caused by a shock that was

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:40.820
5 times greater in terms of loss of wealth
than what happened at the beginning of the

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:44.109
Great Depression. Because we responded dramatically,
more forcefully, much more aggressively, again,

00:00:44.109 --> 00:00:51.079
it was messy; it wasn't pretty to look at,
we were able to prevent unemployment from

00:00:51.079 --> 00:00:55.719
rising beyond 10 percent. The economy started
growing again within 6 months. That was not

00:00:55.719 --> 00:01:00.649
an accident. That was a result of a conscious
set of choices we made to do, some pretty

00:01:00.649 --> 00:01:02.059
unpopular things, pretty counterintuitive
things to prevent the panic from getting so

00:01:02.059 --> 00:01:09.059
much momentum, it would collapse the economy.
Ezra Klein: I think when people hear this.

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:14.840
When they hear the argument that we were bolder
here than we were during the Great Depression,

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:16.300
it feels counterintuitive.
Tim Geithner: It does. Yeah.

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:19.430
Ezra Klein: Because people can name so much
that happened out of the Great Depression

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:23.730
though, Works Progress Administration, Social
Security. I mean you can really just go down

00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:25.780
the line ... What was it called? The alphabet
soup of responses.

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:28.720
Tim Geithner: We did 2 sets of things that
are very different, not just from the Great

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:33.040
Depression, than really what almost any country
has done in the hundred years since. Or what

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:38.360
Europe's done in the last 5 years. First thing
we did was We used the full force of the central

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:45.360
bank monetary policy and the fiscal authorities,
stimulus, tax cuts, spending increases, as

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:49.680
well as a set of financial programs to prevent
a collapse. We used those in concert together.

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:53.340
Typically, what you saw in the Great Depression
is they're working against each other where

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:56.710
you leave some of those tools unaddressed
or they're hidden in the closet. Very unique

00:01:56.710 --> 00:02:00.670
what we did. Again, It was a little late the
beginning, and it wasn't sustained as long

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:05.170
as we would like, but we used that full force
of things very dramatically.

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:11.299
The fiscal stimulus, for example, was larger
than what Roosevelt did in the Great Depression

00:02:11.299 --> 00:02:16.250
in relative terms. Even though it was a little
over too quickly, it wasn't as large as we

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:21.989
needed, so that was the first thing we did.
which was use those tools very aggressively,

00:02:21.989 --> 00:02:26.480
in concert together. They were much more powerful
together being used in concert, than they

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:30.659
would have been if they had been used just
individually. Simple reason, if your banking

00:02:30.659 --> 00:02:37.659
system's broken, monetary policy doesn't really
work. You can't get the oxygen where it's

00:02:37.819 --> 00:02:42.099
needed.
Second thing we did was to do a very aggressive

00:02:42.099 --> 00:02:47.159
restructuring, recapitalization of the financial
system. We cleaned out the worst parts of

00:02:47.159 --> 00:02:52.349
it, and we left the core of the system with
much more capital against future losses, and

00:02:52.349 --> 00:02:56.540
that meant the financial system was able to
give more oxygen to the economy as it recovered;

00:02:56.540 --> 00:03:01.680
it wasn't a huge drag on the economy. The
tools we used to do that and backstop the

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:06.639
commercial paper markets, the credit markets
for the average consumer, they were very innovative,

00:03:06.639 --> 00:03:11.069
very creative, and their scale remarkable.
We backstopped indirectly, directly about

00:03:11.069 --> 00:03:15.439
30 trillion dollars in financial assets. They're
very complicated mix of programs.

00:03:15.439 --> 00:03:19.249
That had never been attempted or done. It
was the scale of that response that made it

00:03:19.249 --> 00:03:23.989
possible for us to get the economy growing
again within 6 months, really remarkably quickly.

00:03:23.989 --> 00:03:30.329
It made it possible for us to return to the
taxpayer a positive return on the financial

00:03:30.329 --> 00:03:34.389
programs. Remember, people thought even in
early '09, that we would lose 2 trillion dollars.

00:03:34.389 --> 00:03:40.870
If you just look at the returns today, expected
returns, the taxpayer's going to earn ... We

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:44.370
didn't do it for this purpose. They're going
to earn between a hundred and two hundred

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:49.849
billion dollars. In effect, we made the financial
system pay for the support we gave them.

00:03:49.849 --> 00:03:52.700
We didn't do it for them. We didn't do it
for the banks. We did it to protect the Main

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:57.560
Street from a failing financial system.
Ezra Klein: You talk about in the book, the

00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:02.889
paradox of financial crises, and it goes to
this point exactly. When people I think look

00:04:02.889 --> 00:04:06.739
back on it, and they think about backstopping
these 30 trillion dollar markets, when they

00:04:06.739 --> 00:04:12.590
think about bailing out AIG, there's a feeling
that, one, it was really bad. Even if it could've

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:14.709
been worse, it was really bad.
Tim Geithner: It was terrible.

00:04:14.709 --> 00:04:21.709
Ezra Klein: A lot of these guys got away.
Part of what you're saying here is that restraining

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:29.500
the impulse to go in and punish was part of
what permitted a speedy recovery than what

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:34.880
we've seen in other countries and what we've
seen in other times. Why would that be? Why

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:39.580
wouldn't disciplining the market in a more
aggressive way, disciplining, making an example

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:44.670
out of people, marching them out in cuffs,
help at least set a lesson, bring confidence

00:04:44.670 --> 00:04:48.700
back to folks, that we're setting the rules
down and this won't happen again?

00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:52.160
Tim Geithner: That's the core question. It's
what I try to explain, write about it in the

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:59.160
book. It's the central paradox of panics.
In most crises, in most states of the world,

00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:03.420
the basic instinct you described is the necessary
right instinct. You want people to fail if

00:05:03.420 --> 00:05:10.220
they took mistakes. You want them accountable
for doing dumb things. You want them to bear

00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:16.020
the consequence of those choices. That's the
natural response, and it's the right response.

00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:20.670
In a panic though, in the classic financial
panic, where the risk of complete collapse

00:05:20.670 --> 00:05:25.230
of the financial system is present or at the
edge of the abyss, then you have to suspend

00:05:25.230 --> 00:05:29.640
that impulse, not indefinitely, but just temporarily
and make sure you're focusing all your attention

00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:34.090
on this simple moral imperative, and it's
a moral imperative, of keeping the lights

00:05:34.090 --> 00:05:37.500
on in the financial system.
Because if you let the system collapse, the

00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:44.500
damage to the average person is catastrophic.
It doesn't mean you should suspend that sense

00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:49.900
of justice and the sense of outrage. It's
just you have to figure out ... You put out

00:05:49.900 --> 00:05:53.840
the fire first, and then you got to figure
out how to, not just create stronger set of

00:05:53.840 --> 00:05:58.960
rules, but hold people accountable for what
happened. In our system, what we tried to

00:05:58.960 --> 00:06:03.340
do was put out the fires. We protected people
from even more damage. You're right. There's

00:06:03.340 --> 00:06:08.870
still a lot damage, but then try to move very
quickly to put in place a stronger enforcement

00:06:08.870 --> 00:06:12.860
response and to put in place tougher set of
rules over the system going forward.

00:06:12.860 --> 00:06:16.730
Ezra Klein: Let me ask you a broad question
about that. When you were going through it,

00:06:16.730 --> 00:06:23.250
even just looking back now, did you feel that
there were people who in a perfect world should

00:06:23.250 --> 00:06:30.250
be held accountable, or did you feel this
was a systemic period of overconfidence, and

00:06:31.430 --> 00:06:36.830
it wasn't that individuals were doing things
that they should be, even in a perfect world,

00:06:36.830 --> 00:06:40.270
punished for, it's just that everything got
a little bit out of hand?

00:06:40.270 --> 00:06:46.270
Tim Geithner: No. There was an appalling amount
of fraud and abuse and bad behavior in the

00:06:46.270 --> 00:06:50.810
run up to the crisis that caused a lot of
damage. I think the American people deserved

00:06:50.810 --> 00:06:55.630
a more forceful enforcement response, more
forceful response to that. That was very important.

00:06:55.630 --> 00:07:01.640
In fact, you could say that period of optimism,
the mania, the period of exuberance, it in

00:07:01.640 --> 00:07:08.330
some sense provided the oxygen for a huge
amount of abuse and fraud. Absolutely, it

00:07:08.330 --> 00:07:13.320
was a lot of it. Even if it wasn't central
to causing the worse parts of the crisis,

00:07:13.320 --> 00:07:18.790
it was very damaging. It caused a huge loss
of confidence in the fairness of the system.

00:07:18.790 --> 00:07:25.790
Again, in a panic, because of the consequence
of panics, you have to do a little bit of

00:07:26.770 --> 00:07:30.910
sequencing of your actions. You've got to
make sure the lights stay on first because

00:07:30.910 --> 00:07:35.840
if they don't, the damage to the innocent
victim is much more traumatic. Why would that

00:07:35.840 --> 00:07:39.470
be just?
Ezra Klein: You ultimately end up, despite

00:07:39.470 --> 00:07:44.580
being I think pretty frustrated with the American
political system, with a fundamentally optimistic

00:07:44.580 --> 00:07:50.900
take on it, that when the chips are down,
the system responds effectively, not beautifully,

00:07:50.900 --> 00:07:55.530
but ultimately effectively. I was thinking
about that a little bit in terms of which

00:07:55.530 --> 00:08:00.020
problems we are and are not good at solving.
I think if you look back at the financial

00:08:00.020 --> 00:08:06.300
crisis, when firms were at the risk of collapsing,
ultimately the American political system would

00:08:06.300 --> 00:08:08.750
respond, I mean-
Tim Geithner: Not because of the firms though.

00:08:08.750 --> 00:08:14.370
Ezra Klein: I recognize that, but nevertheless,
we then had a really extended and continue

00:08:14.370 --> 00:08:18.390
to have unemployment crisis. At a certain
point, the American political system stopped

00:08:18.390 --> 00:08:19.190
responding.
Tim Geithner: I agree with that.

00:08:19.190 --> 00:08:23.890
Ezra Klein: We have decided to live with that.
Why do you think that is? Why do you think

00:08:23.890 --> 00:08:29.860
that the sort of urgent collapses on Wall
Street did ultimately force action, whereas

00:08:29.860 --> 00:08:34.129
at a certain point we decided, if these millions
of people just become long term unemployed,

00:08:34.129 --> 00:08:39.490
that is a cost that we'll live with?
Tim Geithner: I think in the midst of the

00:08:39.490 --> 00:08:44.339
darkest days of the fall of '08, there was
enough fear and panic about the cost of the

00:08:44.339 --> 00:08:48.810
average American that congress felt they had
to respond. They didn't really know what it

00:08:48.810 --> 00:08:52.360
was going to take, but they really had to.
There's no alternate at that point. That wasn't

00:08:52.360 --> 00:08:57.319
because of the power of the institutions in
Wall Street. It's because of a widespread

00:08:57.319 --> 00:09:02.069
recognition that the value of America savings
had just fallen by a level 5 times greater

00:09:02.069 --> 00:09:07.120
than what started the Great Depression. It
was a overwhelming existential imperative

00:09:07.120 --> 00:09:12.160
at that time. People have written over time
that our system is pretty good at crises.

00:09:12.160 --> 00:09:18.449
It's really pretty good, over time facing
existential threat, marshaling the unique

00:09:18.449 --> 00:09:22.079
strengths of the United States to deploy the
type of response you need.

00:09:22.079 --> 00:09:29.079
Then, what happened? What happened is that
the basic divisiveness of the American political

00:09:29.639 --> 00:09:36.290
system, the loss of confidence in government,
the scale of the political opposition to government,

00:09:36.290 --> 00:09:40.089
the scale of the skepticism about deficits
in that context took over, and there was a

00:09:40.089 --> 00:09:45.060
bit of premature austerity fever. That saps
the will and the strength to do a bunch of

00:09:45.060 --> 00:09:49.730
things that would have helped make the recovery
stronger. We were growing, but growing at

00:09:49.730 --> 00:09:54.420
pace that was too slow to bring unemployment
down as fast as we could have in that context.

00:09:54.420 --> 00:10:00.680
I guess you could say it was what history
has shown about the United States, which is

00:10:00.680 --> 00:10:07.680
in the acute extremes, when you're at the
edge of the abyss, our system; again, it's

00:10:08.050 --> 00:10:12.759
sometimes messy, responded pretty well. Remember,
that was a very dangerous moment because we

00:10:12.759 --> 00:10:19.279
were at the midst of a political transition
across parties, no strong governing majority

00:10:19.279 --> 00:10:23.670
in congress, a very dangerous moment. Yet
at that moment, you had Democrats and Republicans

00:10:23.670 --> 00:10:27.059
come together and say, "We're going to do
what it takes," in that context. That's a

00:10:27.059 --> 00:10:29.699
good thing for the country.
It's not enough though because a lot of the

00:10:29.699 --> 00:10:36.470
challenges we still face as a country, they're
going to require compromise and accommodation

00:10:36.470 --> 00:10:42.339
and legislation that's going to require majorities
that include Democrats and Republicans. Unless

00:10:42.339 --> 00:10:46.029
we rebuild that capacity, it's going to harder
for us to make a bigger dent on some of these

00:10:46.029 --> 00:10:50.389
long term challenges.
Ezra Klein: How different was dealing with

00:10:50.389 --> 00:10:56.470
Republicans in the House and the Senate behind
closed doors, versus what it was like in public

00:10:56.470 --> 00:11:02.980
at a hearing or even non-direct negotiations
with just the two parties kind of coming to

00:11:02.980 --> 00:11:05.230
their positions and articulating them to the
public?

00:11:05.230 --> 00:11:09.990
Tim Geithner: It's very different worlds.
The world that most Americans see is the world

00:11:09.990 --> 00:11:15.540
of extreme, adolescent political theater.
When you're in a room, and you're trying to

00:11:15.540 --> 00:11:22.430
solve a problem; you're working through something.
It's a sort of more encouraging thing about

00:11:22.430 --> 00:11:27.199
those individuals on the Hill and their willingness
to try and think about problems. Ultimately,

00:11:27.199 --> 00:11:31.790
what happens though is you leave the room,
and they go back and try to figure out, can

00:11:31.790 --> 00:11:36.089
they get the votes for something in their
party? Most of things that the country needs

00:11:36.089 --> 00:11:38.779
today, they're pretty divisive.
Ezra Klein: As a reporter, one of the things

00:11:38.779 --> 00:11:45.779
I found over and again, is that all these
processes begin in a room, to some degree.

00:11:45.829 --> 00:11:49.470
When they begin, you'll call the people who
are in the room, and these are the folks with

00:11:49.470 --> 00:11:53.660
the information. They'll say, "God, that was
really encouraging. I really think we might

00:11:53.660 --> 00:11:57.629
be able to get something done here." With
every step people takes out of the room, and

00:11:57.629 --> 00:12:03.119
eventually you have to go out of the room,
it becomes more and more remote, and typically

00:12:03.119 --> 00:12:09.259
it ultimately, completely falls apart. It
often felt to me that the room doesn't mislead

00:12:09.259 --> 00:12:15.649
anyone in Washington so much as it misleads
the people in it -- because the feeling of

00:12:15.649 --> 00:12:20.589
working things out on an individual level,
it feels so normal, and as you say, it's more

00:12:20.589 --> 00:12:26.300
adult.
Then, when you leave that room, the basic

00:12:26.300 --> 00:12:30.749
dynamics of American politics at this moment
in time with the parties as polarized as they

00:12:30.749 --> 00:12:35.550
are take over. All of a sudden, how goodhearted
the individuals are, it doesn't matter much

00:12:35.550 --> 00:12:36.689
that anymore.
Tim Geithner: True, but remember the people

00:12:36.689 --> 00:12:43.689
in those rooms are masters of the craft. They're
realists; no naive idealists in those rooms.

00:12:44.350 --> 00:12:49.759
They're pretty pragmatic people. They understand
the constraints. It's better to try. It's

00:12:49.759 --> 00:12:54.110
better to try rather to just sitting back
and saying you're only going to play at the

00:12:54.110 --> 00:12:58.569
level of theater. Unless you get in a room
with people and understand what their constraints

00:12:58.569 --> 00:13:02.300
are, what their incentives are, what their
interests are, what they need, there's no

00:13:02.300 --> 00:13:06.339
way you can govern and compromise. You have
to do that. It's worth the attempt.

00:13:06.339 --> 00:13:10.639
Ezra Klein: There's a different spin on the
room that I think relates to the question

00:13:10.639 --> 00:13:15.699
of whose problems we solve effectively. It
seemed to me that one of the inequities in

00:13:15.699 --> 00:13:20.149
the crisis response as it has gone over times,
is that Congress can do more directly for

00:13:20.149 --> 00:13:23.029
Main Street than the Federal Reserve can,
or at least than Federal Reserve believes

00:13:23.029 --> 00:13:29.410
it can. Yet, Congress is much more gummed
up political polarization. The Federal Reserve

00:13:29.410 --> 00:13:35.360
has been able to continue what it sees as
a pretty aggressive policy of helping the

00:13:35.360 --> 00:13:40.129
economy long after Congress has had to stop,
and so you've had, it seems to me, a longer

00:13:40.129 --> 00:13:43.749
period of support. It's not meant to just
help the financial system, but it does help

00:13:43.749 --> 00:13:49.879
the financial system than we were able to
get for Main Street, simply because the actual

00:13:49.879 --> 00:13:54.679
processes by which we help the 2 groups are
different. The Fed's is at this point more

00:13:54.679 --> 00:13:58.189
technocratic.
Tim Geithner: The only thing that I want to

00:13:58.189 --> 00:14:02.329
change your view on a little bit, is the way
you describe the way those 2 different policies

00:14:02.329 --> 00:14:09.329
work and who they help in that context. Monetary
policy doesn't exist to help the financial

00:14:11.300 --> 00:14:17.889
system. Just look at the history of mistakes
of central banks. Who bears the burden of

00:14:17.889 --> 00:14:23.279
the mistakes? Both ways. The burden of if
it's too much inflation or unemployment way

00:14:23.279 --> 00:14:30.279
overshooting, that's a challenge, a burden
that the average person bears. The reason

00:14:31.670 --> 00:14:37.019
why people invested so much and effort over
time in designing institutions around central

00:14:37.019 --> 00:14:41.970
banks that have that level of independence
and expertise is because it's the only way

00:14:41.970 --> 00:14:45.689
to improve the odds that the outcomes for
the average person are better than what we

00:14:45.689 --> 00:14:48.999
see in countries where central banks are not
independent or they're run politicians.

00:14:48.999 --> 00:14:54.399
In fact, you could say the opposite in some
sense. You could say that in those more politicized

00:14:54.399 --> 00:15:00.829
systems, the outcomes of central banks are
much more favorable to the financial interest

00:15:00.829 --> 00:15:05.100
than is through in a system with this, "Do
we have independence?" Your central point

00:15:05.100 --> 00:15:12.100
is true that in our system of government,
the fiscal powers that can affect the economy,

00:15:12.730 --> 00:15:17.439
help us grow faster, bring down unemployment
fast, equip people to compete more effectively

00:15:17.439 --> 00:15:24.439
in this tough world we live in. Those powers
overwhelmingly exist, or Congress's powers,

00:15:24.829 --> 00:15:30.209
any action has to go through Congress. If
Congress is unable and unwilling to act, then

00:15:30.209 --> 00:15:33.149
you're left with much worse economic outcomes
than are achievable.

00:15:33.149 --> 00:15:37.709
The Fed cannot compensate that for that. It
just puts a greater burden on the Fed instruments

00:15:37.709 --> 00:15:39.249
to do it, but it can't compensate for that
failure.

00:15:39.249 --> 00:15:43.670
Ezra Klein: Right. I wouldn't argue that the
Fed is motivated by the banks, but I would

00:15:43.670 --> 00:15:48.170
say is that, the set of tools the Fed believes
it has right now ... Sitting not too far from

00:15:48.170 --> 00:15:52.619
me is Matt Yglesias, who thinks that Ben Bernanke
should be doing something a whole lot closer,

00:15:52.619 --> 00:15:55.819
or now Janet Yellen rather, she should be
doing something a whole lot closer to just

00:15:55.819 --> 00:15:57.029
sending people checks.
Tim Geithner: Right.

00:15:57.029 --> 00:16:01.949
Ezra Klein: In terms of powers of Fed it feels
that it has, you've got a lot of money and

00:16:01.949 --> 00:16:05.779
a lot of easing going in the financial system,
and the banks are not often taking the next

00:16:05.779 --> 00:16:10.199
step of lending it out aggressively, of actually
pumping that money through the economy. Congress

00:16:10.199 --> 00:16:14.399
could do that. Congress could take those really
low interest rates and turn them into tax

00:16:14.399 --> 00:16:20.600
cuts, but they're not doing that. They could
it into infrastructure investment.

00:16:20.600 --> 00:16:26.279
It doesn't seem to me in any way to be a issue
of motivation, but is a structural issue in

00:16:26.279 --> 00:16:31.129
the way economic policy is set and who has
control over what in the American economy,

00:16:31.129 --> 00:16:36.579
has seemed to me that there is a greater capacity
to respond at this point of problems in the

00:16:36.579 --> 00:16:40.920
financial system than there is to respond
to say, the fact that the labor force participation

00:16:40.920 --> 00:16:46.980
rate has fallen, and it's staying whole lot
lower than anyone thinks is a good thing because

00:16:46.980 --> 00:16:51.850
that requires Republicans and Democrats in
Congress to come together and agree on some

00:16:51.850 --> 00:16:54.619
kind of remedy.
Tim Geithner: Yeah. I think we're in violent

00:16:54.619 --> 00:16:57.949
agreement. It would be better for the country,
if it were more active ... If you had a more

00:16:57.949 --> 00:17:04.630
active fiscal powers deployed to address these
things like high levels of long term unemployment

00:17:04.630 --> 00:17:08.909
and growth that's not as fast as it should
be. I completely agree with you.

00:17:08.909 --> 00:17:15.209
Just one qualification since you raised it.
When the Fed lowers interest rates or lowers

00:17:15.209 --> 00:17:22.199
long term interest rates, when that works,
it works in part by raising the value of people's

00:17:22.199 --> 00:17:26.779
savings and lowering the price of their mortgage,
how much they have to pay for their mortgage

00:17:26.779 --> 00:17:31.480
in that context. When that works, it works
because it changes decisions people makes

00:17:31.480 --> 00:17:35.510
about how much they spend and how much they
borrow because it improves the rate of income

00:17:35.510 --> 00:17:39.720
growth of the average person in that context.
I'll say it a little differently. It's just

00:17:39.720 --> 00:17:46.000
that the power of that instrument is inherently
limited, and it can't compensate for the failure

00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:51.080
to use those other things that effectively.
You're right. There's that moment of peril

00:17:51.080 --> 00:17:58.080
when we use those 2 tools and the financial
programs in concert with pretty enormous force.

00:18:00.390 --> 00:18:05.669
Maybe in some sense, the cost of what happened
in that context was the constraints of the

00:18:05.669 --> 00:18:10.350
political system reasserted themselves kind
of quickly, and we lost the power to do enough

00:18:10.350 --> 00:18:12.510
fiscal.
Ezra Klein: Well, one of the weird dramas

00:18:12.510 --> 00:18:19.049
of most of last 5 years on Capitol Hill seemed
to me to be Ben Bernanke as Federal Reserve

00:18:19.049 --> 00:18:25.330
Chair, a George W. Bush appointee, going up
and begging Congress to use the money he was

00:18:25.330 --> 00:18:29.269
giving them ... I mean you talked about interest
rates a second ago. It always seemed to me

00:18:29.269 --> 00:18:33.850
that Ben Bernanke had a really big housing
plan, which was, "I'm going to bring interest

00:18:33.850 --> 00:18:38.630
rates down to almost nothing. You guys need
to help everybody in the county refinance

00:18:38.630 --> 00:18:42.519
their mortgages." There was plan for that
that came out from the Obama administration,

00:18:42.519 --> 00:18:45.559
and it never went anywhere in Congress at
all.

00:18:45.559 --> 00:18:50.429
The Fed did take the hard part of that tool
and put it on the table, but the next step

00:18:50.429 --> 00:18:54.789
that had to be taken, which is it actually
pushed the banks and make it simpler through

00:18:54.789 --> 00:18:58.870
Fannie and Freddie and other things, for people
to go and use that money-

00:18:58.870 --> 00:19:03.049
Tim Geithner: It's a little better than what
you said though. Something north of 20 million

00:19:03.049 --> 00:19:07.919
Americans refinanced in the crisis. About
a third of those I think were directly things

00:19:07.919 --> 00:19:11.809
that were supported through our programs through
Fannie and Freddie. The rest of it was just

00:19:11.809 --> 00:19:17.450
the natural fact that interest rates came
down and so was economic for people to refinance.

00:19:17.450 --> 00:19:21.750
Now, we had a bunch of proposals we gave Congress
for expanding the reach of those things. Again,

00:19:21.750 --> 00:19:28.159
it would've been better if Congress acted
on those things. So I guess I'm agreeing with

00:19:28.159 --> 00:19:30.510
you again.
Ezra Klein: Let's talk about those housing

00:19:30.510 --> 00:19:36.419
programs for a second. When I talk to folks
both inside the administration and out, the

00:19:36.419 --> 00:19:41.580
part of the crisis response, there is the
most either ambivalence or anger over-

00:19:41.580 --> 00:19:43.330
Tim Geithner: -- or frustration --
Ezra Klein: Is the housing side.

00:19:43.330 --> 00:19:45.940
Tim Geithner: Yeah. Absolutely.
Ezra Klein: I mean there are a couple of dimensions

00:19:45.940 --> 00:19:50.600
of this, but 2 of the main ones are, one,
that there was money sitting in administration

00:19:50.600 --> 00:19:55.029
programs, sitting in treasury essentially
that was not used, and they could've been

00:19:55.029 --> 00:19:58.510
used theoretically with executive action.
Tim Geithner: Can I just respond to that piece?

00:19:58.510 --> 00:20:02.519
Ezra Klein: Yes.
Tim Geithner: We put aside 50 billion dollars

00:20:02.519 --> 00:20:09.370
from the initial TARP of 30 to spend on housing
programs. We supported over time a pretty

00:20:09.370 --> 00:20:16.370
broad mix of programs. When the money wasn't
flowing as aggressive as we thought, we substantially

00:20:16.840 --> 00:20:23.840
increased the incentives. We did that over
and over again. What we found over time that

00:20:24.700 --> 00:20:28.590
we couldn't get enough take up. We tried to
be as aggressive as we could in using it,

00:20:28.590 --> 00:20:31.419
and we had the right incentives.
I mean we had some of the best minds in housing

00:20:31.419 --> 00:20:36.070
in the country sitting there, accountable
for this. We had the president putting enormous

00:20:36.070 --> 00:20:42.190
pressure on this, on us. We looked at every
idea, and we a tried a huge number of things.

00:20:42.190 --> 00:20:48.210
We were as frustrated as everybody was with
this. Certainly, the President was frustrated.

00:20:48.210 --> 00:20:53.250
We had the right incentives, and we worked
really hard at it. We were very creative,

00:20:53.250 --> 00:20:58.559
but we were unable to figure out a way to
get a reach broader than what we had and to

00:20:58.559 --> 00:21:04.389
have it more aggressive. It wasn't because
we were not focused on it or not worried about

00:21:04.389 --> 00:21:07.090
it, not trying. We did a lot of experimentation
too.

00:21:07.090 --> 00:21:12.100
Ezra Klein: Why did the program so underperform?
When you guys dug into it, what did you find

00:21:12.100 --> 00:21:14.490
was actually the obstacle?
Tim Geithner: Let me step back and try to

00:21:14.490 --> 00:21:18.870
do what we tried to do and what we achieved
in this context. We tried to do 3 key things.

00:21:18.870 --> 00:21:22.840
One was to make sure housing prices didn't
fall. They fell 30 percent. When the president

00:21:22.840 --> 00:21:27.480
came in, the futures market said they were
going to fall another 20 to 30 percent. That

00:21:27.480 --> 00:21:31.669
would have been devastating, so we were very
focused on reducing that risk because this

00:21:31.669 --> 00:21:34.649
is the most valuable piece of savings for
most Americans. It would've been devastating

00:21:34.649 --> 00:21:40.659
to the economy. Very successful in putting
a floor under house prices and ultimately

00:21:40.659 --> 00:21:45.230
helping them to start to get going again.
We did that in part by ... What the Fed did

00:21:45.230 --> 00:21:49.070
in part by trying to make that people could
borrow to finance a mortgage again. Those

00:21:49.070 --> 00:21:52.289
markets didn't shut down dramatically.
Second thing we tried to do was to make sure

00:21:52.289 --> 00:21:56.610
people could refinance on a broad scale, had
a big tax cut like effects, very substantial.

00:21:56.610 --> 00:22:01.870
In some sense for the average who refinanced,
those tax cuts were larger than the Recovery

00:22:01.870 --> 00:22:06.000
Act in that context. Again, somewhere north
of 20 million Americans were able ... That's

00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:11.899
a pretty broad reach program in that context.
Then, we tried, and this was the hardest thing,

00:22:11.899 --> 00:22:15.570
to help as many Americans as we could who
could afford to stay in their home if you

00:22:15.570 --> 00:22:20.059
gave them some help staying in their home.
Ultimately, there was something like 5 million

00:22:20.059 --> 00:22:24.320
foreclosures avoided because of the mortgage
modification that we supported directly and

00:22:24.320 --> 00:22:27.830
put money behind and because of those that
the private markets did on their own on the

00:22:27.830 --> 00:22:34.830
model of programs. That 5 million, it wasn't
10 million, but it couldn't really have been

00:22:35.380 --> 00:22:39.210
10 million. It was probably going to be 5
million no matter what because there was a

00:22:39.210 --> 00:22:46.000
whole range of people who had financed a second
a home or financed a home that was just going

00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:51.809
to be unaffordable for them in that context.
There was a limited number of people we could

00:22:51.809 --> 00:22:58.659
reach. The basic constraint on doing more
quicker was in part because we were working

00:22:58.659 --> 00:23:03.639
through a pretty broken banking servicers
industry. We had to go work through those

00:23:03.639 --> 00:23:10.429
pipes. Couldn't go around them, and they were
terrible, terribly staffed, terrible resources,

00:23:10.429 --> 00:23:16.769
and way inadequate to a calamity like this
in that context. Again, we did as much as

00:23:16.769 --> 00:23:20.649
we could with the authority we had. We had
all the right incentives. We had just demonstrated

00:23:20.649 --> 00:23:23.899
we could be enormously creative and a range
of other things where we're taking a lot of

00:23:23.899 --> 00:23:27.539
risk. We brought that same mix of talent with
a bunch of better housing talent to it. We

00:23:27.539 --> 00:23:31.639
looked at every idea that was out there. Again,
we had a president putting enormous on us

00:23:31.639 --> 00:23:35.690
to try and do it.
In the end though, the reach of our programs

00:23:35.690 --> 00:23:39.510
just wasn't enough. It wasn't strong enough,
wasn't large enough relative to the force

00:23:39.510 --> 00:23:42.889
of the pressures.
Ezra Klein: Within that though, one of the

00:23:42.889 --> 00:23:48.630
arguments people make isn't you guys actually
relied too much on the pipes, on the existing

00:23:48.630 --> 00:23:53.440
housing market, that what you should have
done was push much harder for what folks call,

00:23:53.440 --> 00:23:58.289
"cramdown" and use the legal system.
Tim Geithner: Good argument. Yeah. The president

00:23:58.289 --> 00:24:02.039
supported what you call a cramdown. This was
bankruptcy reform to give the borrower a little

00:24:02.039 --> 00:24:07.779
more leverage in renegotiating their mortgage.
Good idea. He supported it when he was a senator

00:24:07.779 --> 00:24:12.870
and a candidate. We tried twice in Congress
to get that through. Again, we had a support

00:24:12.870 --> 00:24:18.220
of president, a pretty talented legislative
staff at that moment, and they run against

00:24:18.220 --> 00:24:21.669
a pretty immovable force in terms of ... We
couldn't get enough Democrats who support-

00:24:21.669 --> 00:24:24.990
Ezra Klein: How hard did you guys try that?
Because when I spoke to people in Congress

00:24:24.990 --> 00:24:30.309
who were behind cramdown, they felt that the
White House kind pro forma supported it and

00:24:30.309 --> 00:24:34.190
did not put their shoulder into it.
Tim Geithner: My view is ... You had the president

00:24:34.190 --> 00:24:38.990
of the United States who was for it. He wanted
it. He thought it was important. He campaigned

00:24:38.990 --> 00:24:42.990
on it in some sense. You had a pretty talented,
pretty creative staff at that point with the

00:24:42.990 --> 00:24:47.149
right incentives. My sense, is watching from
a distance, and I wasn't the main architect

00:24:47.149 --> 00:24:53.830
of this, was that they worked at it, and they
were unsuccessful, but you have to be a little

00:24:53.830 --> 00:25:00.600
realistic about what the alternative could
have produced in that context. It's not clear

00:25:00.600 --> 00:25:05.320
that would have given such a dramatic change
and actual leverage. You'd still be still

00:25:05.320 --> 00:25:08.210
working through the same pipes, maybe worse
pipes because you have to go through the court

00:25:08.210 --> 00:25:12.380
system or inside the court system.
I don't think it addresses the concern you

00:25:12.380 --> 00:25:17.110
raised about we were mistaken to rely on the
existing plumbing. The other thing people

00:25:17.110 --> 00:25:21.399
suggest is why don't you just create your
own plumbing, create a whole institution separate

00:25:21.399 --> 00:25:26.179
going around all that broken plumbing of servicers
and try to write a direct response mechanism

00:25:26.179 --> 00:25:31.639
to homeowners? Our judgment was, and I'm very
confident in this, that would ... We have

00:25:31.639 --> 00:25:35.669
to appropriate money for that. That's creating
a whole new government agency. It would have

00:25:35.669 --> 00:25:41.380
taken a really long time, really complex to
do. Probably would have been slower than working

00:25:41.380 --> 00:25:45.759
through those existing pipes and doing what
we tried to do to get them more quickly. Anyway,

00:25:45.759 --> 00:25:50.120
most frustrating thing for all us, the most
disappointing in outcome.

00:25:50.120 --> 00:25:54.990
The outcomes were more a function of the basic
constraints we were facing, than they were

00:25:54.990 --> 00:25:59.820
a function of either lack of incentive, lack
of effort, lack of creativity.

00:25:59.820 --> 00:26:03.899
Ezra Klein: To look forward for a second,
the other big thing that you guys did around

00:26:03.899 --> 00:26:10.240
the crisis was attempt to keep another one
from happening. Those rules, Dodd-Frank, some

00:26:10.240 --> 00:26:13.169
of them are now in place, some of them are
still working their way through regulatory

00:26:13.169 --> 00:26:19.820
process. When I look at them, when I try to
figure out how to tell myself the story, that

00:26:19.820 --> 00:26:26.820
I don't need to keep my money in the mattress,
the thing that worries me about them is that

00:26:27.769 --> 00:26:32.909
they seem to me to give regulators, they put
a lot of faith in the regulatory system. Yet,

00:26:32.909 --> 00:26:37.110
the periods of time when crises happen are
the periods in which regulators are the least

00:26:37.110 --> 00:26:40.620
likely to use that authority.
I mean I think there's a very good case to

00:26:40.620 --> 00:26:45.820
made that Alan Greenspan could have stopped
this crisis from happening in the early 2000s.

00:26:45.820 --> 00:26:50.289
That there were things that regulators could
have done in terms of forcing more capital

00:26:50.289 --> 00:26:55.909
banks in terms of being much more aggressive
in terms of regulating how the housing market

00:26:55.909 --> 00:27:00.679
was moving at that point. That really could
have mattered, but people psychologically,

00:27:00.679 --> 00:27:05.460
a lot of the folks in power, didn't think
they needed to. That is endemic to the periods

00:27:05.460 --> 00:27:08.950
that create financial crises. If people were
looking for the crisis, they wouldn't stop

00:27:08.950 --> 00:27:14.120
it, So why are you confident that the Dodd-Frank
had created a situation which the next time

00:27:14.120 --> 00:27:18.769
we're in this kind of a buildup, regulators
will want to use the tools and the authority

00:27:18.769 --> 00:27:21.590
they had.
Because the other option is doing much blunter

00:27:21.590 --> 00:27:27.580
rules like ... People talk about breaking
up big banks, meaning more to the point, having

00:27:27.580 --> 00:27:33.740
very raw, crude leverage ratios that you just
have to keep a lot more capital on you at

00:27:33.740 --> 00:27:34.879
all times.
Tim Geithner: Good question. Let's do the

00:27:34.879 --> 00:27:39.299
causes, and then I'll explain the theory behind
our response and reforms.

00:27:39.299 --> 00:27:46.090
This crisis was so damaging because of the
panic. The panic was the result of the fact

00:27:46.090 --> 00:27:53.029
that over time, our financial system outgrew
all the protections we put in place after

00:27:53.029 --> 00:28:00.000
the Great Depression. We had a set of constraints
on risk taking in banks, around banks, that

00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:03.870
we think in retrospect weren't conservative
enough, but they were conservative enough

00:28:03.870 --> 00:28:08.529
so that there was a huge build up in risk
outside the banks where it's unconstrained.

00:28:08.529 --> 00:28:12.580
Risk was just able to migrate around that
and go into a set of institutions, very large

00:28:12.580 --> 00:28:18.500
ones, investment banks like Lehman or Bear
Stearns or the rest of them, AIG, GE Capital,

00:28:18.500 --> 00:28:23.730
Fannie and Freddie, that existed outside those
protections and were terrible vulnerable to

00:28:23.730 --> 00:28:29.399
panic and runs.
That's what caused the crisis. When you think

00:28:29.399 --> 00:28:33.190
about what the defense about that is, what
you need to do is to make sure not just that

00:28:33.190 --> 00:28:36.490
that you have thicker shock absorbers around
banks, better constraints, simple constraints

00:28:36.490 --> 00:28:41.860
on risk taking, but they're extended broad
enough, so you don't recreate again a situation

00:28:41.860 --> 00:28:45.659
where banks are a small fraction of credit
and all the risk in a panic vulnerability

00:28:45.659 --> 00:28:49.200
is out there. That's why our crisis was so
damaging. That's why it's so hard to arrest.

00:28:49.200 --> 00:28:52.649
Now, in your basic theory though, I very much
agree with you which is, you don't want to

00:28:52.649 --> 00:28:59.649
design a system that depends on agile, prescient
regulators with perfect foresight, no political

00:29:00.710 --> 00:29:05.830
constraints, tightening up these rules in
a discretionary basis as things feel kind

00:29:05.830 --> 00:29:12.409
of frothy because there's just a risk that
they'll be late or, I don't know, indifferent

00:29:12.409 --> 00:29:17.610
or sort of think it's a new normal kind of
thing, great moderation kind of thing. You

00:29:17.610 --> 00:29:19.529
don't want to do that.
We tried not to do that, actually. We need

00:29:19.529 --> 00:29:23.330
a more simple imperative which is very similar
to what you said, which is we said, "Most

00:29:23.330 --> 00:29:27.679
important thing you can do, is to make sure
you have much tougher constraints on risk

00:29:27.679 --> 00:29:33.350
taking applied more broadly across the system,
so that you can be closer to be able to be

00:29:33.350 --> 00:29:37.580
indifferent to the fate of individual institutions."
You want a system as Larry used to say, "Safe

00:29:37.580 --> 00:29:41.399
for failure."
The theory behind our reform is very much

00:29:41.399 --> 00:29:47.350
like that. It's saying, you get these things
thicker, and you keep them thicker, and you

00:29:47.350 --> 00:29:52.320
apply them more broadly. It's the best defense
against panics you have. The most important

00:29:52.320 --> 00:29:57.649
thing down those reforms was those set of
changes to the regime of capital. They're

00:29:57.649 --> 00:30:00.320
dramatically more conservative today, and
they're applied more broadly.

00:30:00.320 --> 00:30:04.659
Now, over time like water flows around stones
in a river, they're going to ... Risk will

00:30:04.659 --> 00:30:08.600
migrate around that. It's the forever war.
You've got to keep at it, keep looking at

00:30:08.600 --> 00:30:12.190
ways to makes sure you can protect against
that risk. It's much better against ... Yours

00:30:12.190 --> 00:30:19.190
is the right standard. Again, you don't want
a system that's vulnerable to the wisdom and

00:30:19.539 --> 00:30:26.539
courage of regulators that depends on foresight
and preemption because financial crises really

00:30:28.149 --> 00:30:31.070
aren't amenable to that.
Ezra Klein: I have a couple of very specific

00:30:31.070 --> 00:30:35.309
questions about your book. I would like to
hear more about the time you called Dinesh

00:30:35.309 --> 00:30:38.259
D'Souza a dick.
Tim Geithner: I don't know if I can say more

00:30:38.259 --> 00:30:43.360
about that. I'll tell a story. I went to Dartmouth
College. I met my wife there. I don't know

00:30:43.360 --> 00:30:45.070
if you remember at that time. That was a time
when -

00:30:45.070 --> 00:30:46.570
Ezra Klein: I don't.
Tim Geithner: It was the early-

00:30:46.570 --> 00:30:48.570
Ezra Klein: I do not remember the time when
you were in college-

00:30:48.570 --> 00:30:52.269
Tim Geithner: You were born. You were alive.
It was a time when there's the early stage

00:30:52.269 --> 00:30:57.110
of the conservative movement among college
campuses, and Dartmouth was one of the epicenters

00:30:57.110 --> 00:31:02.200
of that movement. We see the echoes of that
today across the political system. There was

00:31:02.200 --> 00:31:09.200
a group of conservative students at that point
that started a newspaper called The Dartmouth

00:31:09.649 --> 00:31:16.649
Review. They published in their newspaper
a confidential list of members of the Lesbian

00:31:19.440 --> 00:31:23.139
Gay Student Alliance and including a bunch
of people who hadn't come out to their friends

00:31:23.139 --> 00:31:29.570
or their parents. It was devastating to them.
Did it without their consent.

00:31:29.570 --> 00:31:36.570
I ran into them in a line at the dining hall
or one of the café's and said what you quoted.

00:31:36.639 --> 00:31:40.600
Ezra Klein: What did he say in response?
Tim Geithner: I don't remember him saying

00:31:40.600 --> 00:31:42.539
anything in response.
Ezra Klein: You were a republican in college.

00:31:42.539 --> 00:31:46.059
You say in the book.
Tim Geithner: I was. I wasn't really a political

00:31:46.059 --> 00:31:50.259
... I've never really been a political person.
Ezra Klein: One of the things that actually

00:31:50.259 --> 00:31:53.610
surprised me in the book was that your father
voted for Mitt Romney in 2012.

00:31:53.610 --> 00:31:56.580
Tim Geithner: He did. I was surprised by that
too. Actually, I wasn't that surprised by

00:31:56.580 --> 00:32:03.580
that, but he's a sort of classic moderate
republican. I think of it that way. He voted

00:32:06.039 --> 00:32:13.039
for Obama in '08, but he's a more conservative
person by instinct, so it wasn't that surprising

00:32:13.919 --> 00:32:17.600
to me in 12.
Ezra Klein: You weren't able to win that argument?

00:32:17.600 --> 00:32:21.370
Tim Geithner: I didn't really try to talk
him out of him. First of all, he has his convictions.

00:32:21.370 --> 00:32:26.529
I was doing my thing. I didn't really think
it was job to try and change his mind.

00:32:26.529 --> 00:32:32.440
Ezra Klein: One of the things that comes up
a lot in the book, and I was surprised because

00:32:32.440 --> 00:32:35.700
the book is in a lot ways was actually more
personal than I would have thought, and primarily

00:32:35.700 --> 00:32:41.340
in this way; there's a lot of guilt in the
book about how you were as a husband and as

00:32:41.340 --> 00:32:45.820
a father during the years you were in Treasury.
This is not something that I ever heard you

00:32:45.820 --> 00:32:51.909
express before publicly, but it recurs throughout
the length of the book. I'd be curious to

00:32:51.909 --> 00:32:57.509
just hear you say a little bit more about
that, about the interplay between, on the

00:32:57.509 --> 00:33:03.620
one hand trying to be in a position where
it's public, and it's incredibly important,

00:33:03.620 --> 00:33:06.990
what you do affects hundreds of millions and
arguably if you take the global view, even

00:33:06.990 --> 00:33:13.990
more than that people, and then also trying
to be a human being on the other side of it.

00:33:14.090 --> 00:33:19.529
Tim Geithner: Well, it's a kind of a terrible,
irreconcilable tension. My work was hugely

00:33:19.529 --> 00:33:25.769
compelling to me. At times it felt very consequential.
I had no control over its claim on my time.

00:33:25.769 --> 00:33:32.769
There's no control over that at all. If you're
raising a family, it means that you're going

00:33:32.980 --> 00:33:37.929
to miss huge parts of their lives, and you're
going to put an overwhelming burden for being

00:33:37.929 --> 00:33:44.929
a parent on your spouse, a pretty unfair burden.
Then, you inflict on them again the additional

00:33:45.200 --> 00:33:52.200
burden of having a father, a mother, and public
life. It's a huge loss of privacy then. You

00:33:52.999 --> 00:33:58.529
don't want your kids to be defined by the
profile of their parents. It's not a very

00:33:58.529 --> 00:34:00.389
healthy thing for them. It's a very hard thing
to do.

00:34:00.389 --> 00:34:04.830
I mean I love my work. I felt really lucky
to do it, and I had an amazing marriage, amazing

00:34:04.830 --> 00:34:11.399
wife, amazing supportive kids throughout that
period of time. I think because of them, because

00:34:11.399 --> 00:34:16.089
of the support, I was a better decision maker
than I would have been. I was a more careful

00:34:16.089 --> 00:34:21.710
decision maker, more thoughtful than I would
have been, so it was a great benefit to me,

00:34:21.710 --> 00:34:28.710
but hugely costly to them.
Ezra Klein: One of the 
things I was thinking about reading was some

00:34:41.359 --> 00:34:45.839
of that was that it seemed that it was possible
for you to do because you did have an amazing

00:34:45.839 --> 00:34:52.520
wife who's willing and capable of taking on
more of that burden. In a gendered way in

00:34:52.520 --> 00:34:58.630
this society, that would be a lot rarer for
a young female civil servant who have risen

00:34:58.630 --> 00:35:04.450
to your level. I'm curious what you think
about the tensions, that the pressures on

00:35:04.450 --> 00:35:11.450
the family play in terms of who actually can
rise up or how many women can rise up, women

00:35:11.450 --> 00:35:15.640
who have families, can rise up to the very
top levels of positions of power and politics.

00:35:15.640 --> 00:35:19.099
Tim Geithner: I mean my wife had a profession.
She's a practicing therapist, and she had

00:35:19.099 --> 00:35:24.559
a private practice, and then she became a
writer. That profession gave her in some ways

00:35:24.559 --> 00:35:28.050
more flexibility than what I would have, and
that was sort of the necessary part of making

00:35:28.050 --> 00:35:35.050
this work because we wanted to be really engaged
in raising our kids. I think you're completely

00:35:35.960 --> 00:35:40.630
right. I would say though that at Treasury
during that period of time I was there, those

00:35:40.630 --> 00:35:47.630
4 years, there was huge number of senior women
in those jobs, many of them with kids. It's

00:35:52.260 --> 00:35:59.260
not like "It's not possible to do." It's possible
but it puts a really difficult set of choices

00:35:59.619 --> 00:36:02.359
on them and a much a harder thing to balance.
Ezra Klein: Do you think it's in general harder

00:36:02.359 --> 00:36:04.210
on women?
Tim Geithner: That balance?

00:36:04.210 --> 00:36:07.020
Ezra Klein: Yeah.
Tim Geithner: I think it's harder on any woman.

00:36:07.020 --> 00:36:11.730
I do think it is. Of course, lots of people
find their way through this. It depends a

00:36:11.730 --> 00:36:15.369
little bit on the choices their spouse makes
in their work.

00:36:15.369 --> 00:36:20.960
Ezra Klein: When you left Treasury, which
wasn't that long ago, how long have you been

00:36:20.960 --> 00:36:22.829
out?
Tim Geithner: About a year and 3 months.

00:36:22.829 --> 00:36:26.430
Ezra Klein: Are you happy to be out?
Tim Geithner: Well, I love my work and the

00:36:26.430 --> 00:36:29.650
people I work with, but it was sort of time.
It was time.

00:36:29.650 --> 00:36:34.079
Ezra Klein: There was a big guessing game
in Washington about where you'd go, and one

00:36:34.079 --> 00:36:38.900
of the things that there was a lot of fury
about during the period of the financial crisis

00:36:38.900 --> 00:36:45.359
was this feeling of revolving door between
Washington and Wall Street. I mean in the

00:36:45.359 --> 00:36:49.730
highest profile post-crisis I think. Example
you would either or was I'd go to Citi Group

00:36:49.730 --> 00:36:54.190
which was one of the institutions that ended
up getting a lot of bailout money. Prior to

00:36:54.190 --> 00:36:58.630
that you had a lot of folks from Goldman Sachs
become Treasure Secretaries. I mean there

00:36:58.630 --> 00:37:00.700
had really felt to people like-
Tim Geithner: Maybe people thought I came

00:37:00.700 --> 00:37:02.450
from Goldman Sachs.
Ezra Klein: Yes. Many people thought you came

00:37:02.450 --> 00:37:06.400
from Goldman Sachs, and you didn't go into
an investment bank, but you went to private

00:37:06.400 --> 00:37:13.400
equity. I'm curious about that decision, both
for you personally, but also why does it seem

00:37:15.230 --> 00:37:21.839
or why is it the case in fact that so many
economic policy makers end up in some dimension

00:37:21.839 --> 00:37:27.579
of the investment world as opposed to at sort
of name brand companies are producing things

00:37:27.579 --> 00:37:30.559
that people have heard of. You hear about
a lot ... Larry Summers for instance, consults

00:37:30.559 --> 00:37:36.460
for D. E. Shaw. What you don't hear a lot
of is, "Well this top policy maker went to

00:37:36.460 --> 00:37:40.970
General Mills and is now involved in managing
their production process."

00:37:40.970 --> 00:37:44.930
Tim Geithner: That's a good question. I'm
not sure I can speak to the other piece of

00:37:44.930 --> 00:37:46.890
it. Can I explain my piece of it?
Ezra Klein: Yeah. Please.

00:37:46.890 --> 00:37:50.890
Tim Geithner: Then, I can maybe talk about
that. I had this great privilege. I spent

00:37:50.890 --> 00:37:56.160
all my life doing this one thing, but I couldn't
do it forever. I needed to something new,

00:37:56.160 --> 00:38:00.300
and I wanted a different kind of challenge.
I was very worried about this perception,

00:38:00.300 --> 00:38:04.700
and I thought about it quite a bit. I did
not want to go work for a firm that we had

00:38:04.700 --> 00:38:11.530
regulated or that we had rescued. I tried
to be as remote from that as I could. I was

00:38:11.530 --> 00:38:14.520
very careful in trying to make sure I was
working with a group of people that I thought

00:38:14.520 --> 00:38:18.700
were very ethical, and they were doing something
I thought was valuable. I feel very lucky

00:38:18.700 --> 00:38:23.170
in that basic choice.
Now, on your broader question, I agree with

00:38:23.170 --> 00:38:27.180
you about the perception. I think it's a very
damaging perception ... The typical thing

00:38:27.180 --> 00:38:34.000
is people who go run Treasury, will go run
senior parts of Treasury, understandably people

00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:38.380
look for people with financial experience.
That's a good thing. It's not a bad thing

00:38:38.380 --> 00:38:41.960
because you want people who working on the
side of the American people, who have the

00:38:41.960 --> 00:38:46.270
knowledge to be only good decisions about
how to protect their interests. That does

00:38:46.270 --> 00:38:51.880
require experience. Now, a lot of people think
that experience is tainted, and it's complicating

00:38:51.880 --> 00:38:56.230
in that sense. I think you're probably better
with it than without it.

00:38:56.230 --> 00:39:01.510
It's that reality that creates most of this
impression of people when they leave going

00:39:01.510 --> 00:39:05.170
back into finance. Now you cited some examples
of people who didn't come from that in that

00:39:05.170 --> 00:39:11.540
context. Even the 2 you cited had worked in
that area before, but that's the typical thing.

00:39:11.540 --> 00:39:15.970
There's nothing wrong with that. You just
want to make sure you run a set of protections

00:39:15.970 --> 00:39:22.970
so that you eliminate completely the risk
or the perception of risk that that experience

00:39:23.420 --> 00:39:27.660
affects people's judgments when they're in
office. Our system has very good protections

00:39:27.660 --> 00:39:29.990
against that.
Ezra Klein: What are the protections there

00:39:29.990 --> 00:39:36.990
that should make people confident? It is a
I think a difficult thing to believe, that

00:39:38.230 --> 00:39:45.130
folks who have come from the world of finance,
will not in a very natural, very human, very

00:39:45.130 --> 00:39:52.130
sort of deep way have a particular affinity
towards the arguments being made by the people

00:39:52.849 --> 00:39:56.640
they liked and knew. I mean humans have a
tendency to trust more things that come from

00:39:56.640 --> 00:40:01.930
trusted sources than from outside. I take
the point about the expertise, but what are

00:40:01.930 --> 00:40:04.980
the protections that make you confident that
that isn't a problem?

00:40:04.980 --> 00:40:09.500
Tim Geithner: Well, the choices you make in
those jobs are subject to enormous checks

00:40:09.500 --> 00:40:13.549
and balances. First of all as you pointed
out earlier, most of the authority that matters

00:40:13.549 --> 00:40:19.160
that affects the incentives in finance, affects
what you do with the taxpayers' resources

00:40:19.160 --> 00:40:24.170
or decisions that Congress owns. Where they
delegate them, they're highly qualified, and

00:40:24.170 --> 00:40:28.640
there's a set of protections around when rules
are written and how they're disclosed and

00:40:28.640 --> 00:40:33.319
put out for public comments so people can
see them. We try to go way beyond that too

00:40:33.319 --> 00:40:37.630
and to make sure that when we put together
rather elaborate, complicated mix of financial

00:40:37.630 --> 00:40:40.950
programs in the midst of the panic, and we
made the terms of those completely transparent

00:40:40.950 --> 00:40:44.970
to people so people could see them.
You have to very careful that the decisions

00:40:44.970 --> 00:40:49.680
to make are subject to very, very tough sets
of checks and balances, so that you're never

00:40:49.680 --> 00:40:56.680
in the position where the private interest
can--This is in the executive branch--can

00:40:57.170 --> 00:41:01.250
get in the way of the public interest.
Ezra Klein: When you look forward now, I think

00:41:01.250 --> 00:41:08.250
... We just got word the other day that we're
now in a expansion as an economy. It is unusually

00:41:08.750 --> 00:41:13.069
long. We've gone now an unusually long time
for the American economy without a recession.

00:41:13.069 --> 00:41:18.579
There doesn't look to be a recession right
around the corner at least, and yet I think

00:41:18.579 --> 00:41:24.650
that the recovery simultaneously hasn't been
as a deep as people expected. In particular,

00:41:24.650 --> 00:41:29.049
I think the main manifestation of that is
you've got a lot of folks who dropped out

00:41:29.049 --> 00:41:33.770
of the labor force. While the unemployment
rate is coming down quite a bit, it to some

00:41:33.770 --> 00:41:37.049
degree overstates the progress-
Tim Geithner: I agree with that.

00:41:37.049 --> 00:41:41.690
Ezra Klein: We actually made. Do you think
that we've kind of entered a new normal of

00:41:41.690 --> 00:41:47.930
somewhat slower growth and somewhat less employment,
or do you think that the recovery is proceeding

00:41:47.930 --> 00:41:54.170
and will ultimately get us back to the kind
of normal we believed in, in 1999 and 2004

00:41:54.170 --> 00:41:57.119
and 05?
Tim Geithner: I have the latter view, but

00:41:57.119 --> 00:42:00.680
it depends a bit on the choices the political
system makes in the next few years or so.

00:42:00.680 --> 00:42:06.230
Let's just go back to the basic thing about
why this recovery has been only a sort of

00:42:06.230 --> 00:42:10.369
like 2 percent recovery a year rather than
a 3 and half percent recovery. Of course,

00:42:10.369 --> 00:42:15.609
you know about this, written eloquently about
it. A bunch of this is just because we had

00:42:15.609 --> 00:42:18.309
a terrible financial crisis that followed
a wave of too much lending and too borrowing,

00:42:18.309 --> 00:42:24.460
too much leverage. As we work through all
those problems, it slowed growth. As Rogoff

00:42:24.460 --> 00:42:27.630
and Reinhart written, recoveries following
financial crises are much slower. They're

00:42:27.630 --> 00:42:30.980
much more fragile. They take a much a longer
period of time because the things you're doing

00:42:30.980 --> 00:42:35.680
to repair the damage and to heal and create
a better foundation for growth, they slow

00:42:35.680 --> 00:42:38.990
growth in the short term.
Then, we had 2 other things that happened.

00:42:38.990 --> 00:42:45.990
One is we had fiscal policy and a little bit
of premature austerity fever turned too austere

00:42:47.200 --> 00:42:51.420
too quickly. Deficits came down to fast, and
that sucked about a percentage point out of

00:42:51.420 --> 00:42:57.530
growth for on average, most of the last 3
and a half years. Then, we had some a little

00:42:57.530 --> 00:43:00.990
bad luck in terms of some external shocks
from Europe, Japan, some other things like

00:43:00.990 --> 00:43:05.630
that. Those were material in aggregate.
Reason I begin with that because if you look

00:43:05.630 --> 00:43:10.220
at the causes for why people have been disappointed
by the performance of the economy, you can

00:43:10.220 --> 00:43:15.290
attribute more than all that disappointment
to those identifiable factors, so you don't

00:43:15.290 --> 00:43:20.020
have to look for some new dark theory of our
loss of the goods they produce --

00:43:20.020 --> 00:43:24.299
Ezra Klein: -- It's secular stagnations --
Tim Geithner: I think to explain the performance

00:43:24.299 --> 00:43:27.880
of the last 5 years ... It's explainable in
a more simple and somewhat more reassuring

00:43:27.880 --> 00:43:32.700
things because those are transitory things.
My own view is that most of what you're seeing

00:43:32.700 --> 00:43:37.270
today in the economy is just the echoes, the
aftershocks, the tragic aftershocks of the

00:43:37.270 --> 00:43:41.640
devastation of the crisis. Most of it is the
function of the fact that we haven't been

00:43:41.640 --> 00:43:45.869
growing as fast as we could grow. Those headwinds
are receding now, and we have a change now.

00:43:45.869 --> 00:43:49.079
We can grow a little faster for a while. That
should help bring more people back into labor

00:43:49.079 --> 00:43:52.230
force more quickly.
Ultimately we won't know the answer to your

00:43:52.230 --> 00:43:58.540
question till we get through that and see
where we are at that point. I think it's right

00:43:58.540 --> 00:44:05.540
to worry about the risk that ... You've left
people very underemployed, long time out of

00:44:08.140 --> 00:44:12.369
labor force, and you have an education system
that is not good enough really in equipping

00:44:12.369 --> 00:44:17.150
people to compete in this world. Those are
things you want to work at. You want to need

00:44:17.150 --> 00:44:23.190
to work at it relentlessly over time.
I don't think it's quite as dark as that perspective

00:44:23.190 --> 00:44:26.619
implies, but that's not a good reason not
to worry about doing things like how could

00:44:26.619 --> 00:44:31.710
you get more infrastructure, create more demand
and more jobs now, and how do you create better

00:44:31.710 --> 00:44:35.790
outcomes out of the education system, so that
we're improving the odds of people come into

00:44:35.790 --> 00:44:38.799
this pretty challenging world with a better
set of skills to compete.

00:44:38.799 --> 00:44:43.329
Ezra Klein: Your old colleague Larry Summers
has begun considering this darker theory that

00:44:43.329 --> 00:44:46.059
he calls "secular stagnation." When I spoke
to him about it, one of the things he said

00:44:46.059 --> 00:44:53.059
was important was coming up with a test for
how he would be wrong. What is the information

00:44:54.589 --> 00:45:00.099
that would come in that would begin to make
you think that we weren't just in an extended

00:45:00.099 --> 00:45:06.250
period of bad luck or aftershock, but that
something was deficient within the economy's

00:45:06.250 --> 00:45:11.619
either growth engine or its distribution of
jobs engine?

00:45:11.619 --> 00:45:16.990
Tim Geithner: You want to look at ... Short
term unemployment is back down to normal levels

00:45:16.990 --> 00:45:21.329
now, but long term unemployment is very high,
so you want to look at what happens, how quickly

00:45:21.329 --> 00:45:26.069
that starts to come down again, how quickly
people start coming back in the labor force,

00:45:26.069 --> 00:45:30.260
and what do you start to see the conditions
that suggest broader based income growth over

00:45:30.260 --> 00:45:35.920
time. There's reasonable basis for thinking
that's going to happen as long we're creating

00:45:35.920 --> 00:45:40.329
the conditions that create stronger growth.
If we have a period of stronger, a relatively

00:45:40.329 --> 00:45:46.309
strong, a little stronger growth through better
policies, and you're still left with this

00:45:46.309 --> 00:45:52.280
mix of bad outcomes for the average for the
median income and for people long term unemployed,

00:45:52.280 --> 00:45:56.130
then you'd worry.
My view of this is you don't have to debate

00:45:56.130 --> 00:45:59.480
the thing. We don't know the right answer
to it. Don't let the debate get in the way

00:45:59.480 --> 00:46:05.049
of doing a range of powerful things we could
do now that would be good independent of the

00:46:05.049 --> 00:46:09.579
outcome of that debate. It's not a good argument
to change the obvious prescriptions for policy

00:46:09.579 --> 00:46:14.500
for the country now.
