00:00:10.213 --> 00:00:13.132
Last fall, Eric Brynjolfsson and I
published our book

00:00:13.153 --> 00:00:14.799
"Race Against the Machine",

00:00:14.839 --> 00:00:17.553
and we joined a really lively discussion.

00:00:17.588 --> 00:00:18.847
Because, as it turns out,

00:00:18.863 --> 00:00:21.140
when tens of millions
of people are unemployed

00:00:21.192 --> 00:00:22.726
or underemployed,

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:25.950
there's a fair amount of interest
in what technology might be doing

00:00:25.964 --> 00:00:27.126
to the labor force.

00:00:27.126 --> 00:00:29.015
And as I look at the conversation,

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:32.366
it strikes me that it's focused
on exactly the right topic,

00:00:32.743 --> 00:00:35.568
and at the same time,
it's missing the point entirely.

00:00:35.592 --> 00:00:37.133
The topic that it's focused on,

00:00:37.157 --> 00:00:41.643
the question is whether or not all these
digital technologies are affecting

00:00:41.664 --> 00:00:43.681
people's ability to earn a living,

00:00:43.705 --> 00:00:45.690
or, to say it a little bit different way,

00:00:45.714 --> 00:00:47.803
are the droids taking our jobs?

00:00:47.827 --> 00:00:49.764
And there's some evidence that they are.

00:00:49.788 --> 00:00:53.836
The Great Recession ended
when American GDP resumed

00:00:53.857 --> 00:00:56.724
its kind of slow, steady march upward,

00:00:56.748 --> 00:01:00.021
and some other economic indicators
also started to rebound,

00:01:00.042 --> 00:01:02.335
and they got kind of healthy
kind of quickly.

00:01:02.359 --> 00:01:04.525
Corporate profits are quite high;

00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:06.446
in fact, if you include bank profits,

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:08.461
they're higher than they've ever been.

00:01:08.485 --> 00:01:11.861
And business investment
in gear -- in equipment

00:01:11.996 --> 00:01:15.043
and hardware and software --
is at an all-time high.

00:01:15.064 --> 00:01:18.064
So the businesses are getting
out their checkbooks.

00:01:18.403 --> 00:01:20.402
What they're not really doing is hiring.

00:01:20.801 --> 00:01:21.952
So this red line

00:01:21.976 --> 00:01:24.514
is the employment-to-population ratio,

00:01:24.538 --> 00:01:28.276
in other words, the percentage
of working-age people in America

00:01:28.691 --> 00:01:30.077
who have work.

00:01:30.101 --> 00:01:33.101
And we see that it cratered
during the Great Recession,

00:01:33.231 --> 00:01:36.128
and it hasn't started
to `bounce` back at all.

00:01:36.152 --> 00:01:39.071
But the story is not
just a recession story.

00:01:39.095 --> 00:01:41.175
The decade that we've
just been through had

00:01:41.199 --> 00:01:44.199
relatively anemic job growth
all throughout,

00:01:44.436 --> 00:01:47.059
especially when we compare it
to other decades,

00:01:47.083 --> 00:01:50.083
and the 2000s are the only time
we have on record

00:01:50.137 --> 00:01:53.137
where there were fewer people working
at the end of the decade

00:01:53.693 --> 00:01:55.095
than at the beginning.

00:01:55.119 --> 00:01:56.792
This is not what you want to see.

00:01:57.124 --> 00:02:00.493
When you graph the number
of potential employees

00:02:00.531 --> 00:02:03.087
versus the number of jobs in the country,

00:02:03.111 --> 00:02:06.499
you see the gap gets bigger
and bigger over time,

00:02:06.985 --> 00:02:10.281
and then, during the Great Recession,
it opened up in a huge way.

00:02:10.318 --> 00:02:11.779
I did some quick calculations.

00:02:11.803 --> 00:02:14.235
I took the last 20 years of GDP growth

00:02:14.259 --> 00:02:17.259
and the last 20 years
of labor-productivity growth

00:02:17.555 --> 00:02:20.273
and used those in a fairly
straightforward way

00:02:20.297 --> 00:02:23.297
to try to project how many jobs
the economy was going to need

00:02:23.344 --> 00:02:24.647
to keep growing,

00:02:24.671 --> 00:02:26.796
and this is the line that I came up with.

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:28.562
Is that good or bad?

00:02:28.586 --> 00:02:30.497
This is the government's projection

00:02:30.521 --> 00:02:33.521
for the working-age
population going forward.

00:02:33.881 --> 00:02:38.505
So if these predictions are accurate,
that gap is not going to close.

00:02:39.003 --> 00:02:42.003
The problem is, I don't think
these projections are accurate.

00:02:42.053 --> 00:02:45.053
In particular, I think my projection
is way too optimistic,

00:02:45.556 --> 00:02:47.003
because when I did it,

00:02:47.027 --> 00:02:50.917
I was assuming that the future
was kind of going to look like the past,

00:02:51.269 --> 00:02:52.938
with labor productivity growth,

00:02:52.962 --> 00:02:54.833
and that's actually not what I believe.

00:02:54.857 --> 00:02:56.206
Because when I look around,

00:02:56.230 --> 00:02:58.450
I think that we ain't seen nothing yet

00:02:58.474 --> 00:03:01.474
when it comes to technology's
impact on the labor force.

00:03:02.102 --> 00:03:05.843
Just in the past couple years,
we've seen digital tools

00:03:05.945 --> 00:03:10.046
display skills and abilities
that they never, ever had before,

00:03:10.218 --> 00:03:13.832
and that kind of eat deeply
into what we human beings

00:03:13.888 --> 00:03:15.170
do for a living.

00:03:15.194 --> 00:03:17.120
Let me give you a couple examples.

00:03:17.144 --> 00:03:18.396
Throughout all of history,

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:21.801
if you wanted something translated
from one language into another,

00:03:21.994 --> 00:03:23.719
you had to involve a human being.

00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:27.070
Now we have multi-language, `instantaneous`,

00:03:27.222 --> 00:03:31.402
automatic translation services
available for free

00:03:31.666 --> 00:03:34.666
via many of our devices,
all the way down to smartphones.

00:03:34.833 --> 00:03:36.629
And if any of us have used these,

00:03:36.653 --> 00:03:40.011
we know that they're not perfect,
but they're decent.

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:43.652
Throughout all of history,
if you wanted something written,

00:03:43.676 --> 00:03:46.676
a report or an article,
you had to involve a person.

00:03:47.558 --> 00:03:48.711
Not anymore.

00:03:48.735 --> 00:03:51.708
This is an article that appeared
in Forbes online a while back,

00:03:51.732 --> 00:03:52.908
about Apple's earnings.

00:03:52.932 --> 00:03:54.550
It was written by an algorithm.

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:57.977
And it's not decent -- it's perfect.

00:03:59.149 --> 00:04:01.178
A lot of people look at this and they say,

00:04:01.202 --> 00:04:03.507
"OK, but those are very
specific, narrow tasks,

00:04:03.531 --> 00:04:06.442
and most knowledge workers
are actually generalists.

00:04:06.466 --> 00:04:10.481
And what they do is sit on top of a very
large body of expertise and knowledge

00:04:10.682 --> 00:04:14.294
and they use that to react on the fly
to kind of unpredictable demands,

00:04:14.359 --> 00:04:16.478
and that's very, very hard to automate."

00:04:17.202 --> 00:04:20.108
One of the most impressive
knowledge workers in recent memory

00:04:20.132 --> 00:04:21.653
is a guy named Ken Jennings.

00:04:21.677 --> 00:04:26.491
He won the quiz show
"Jeopardy!" 74 times in a row.

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:29.200
Took home three million dollars.

00:04:29.224 --> 00:04:32.634
That's Ken on the right,
getting beat three-to-one

00:04:33.019 --> 00:04:37.508
by Watson, the Jeopardy-playing
supercomputer from IBM.

00:04:38.042 --> 00:04:41.524
So when we look at what technology can do
to general knowledge workers,

00:04:41.581 --> 00:04:44.581
I start to think there might not be
something so special

00:04:44.683 --> 00:04:46.451
about this idea of a generalist,

00:04:46.475 --> 00:04:50.382
particularly when we start doing things
like hooking Siri up to Watson,

00:04:50.829 --> 00:04:53.829
and having technologies
that can understand what we're saying

00:04:54.122 --> 00:04:56.106
and repeat speech back to us.

00:04:56.130 --> 00:04:59.715
Now, Siri is far from perfect,
and we can make fun of her flaws,

00:05:00.057 --> 00:05:01.556
but we should also keep in mind

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:06.565
that if technologies like Siri and Watson
improve along a Moore's law trajectory,

00:05:06.968 --> 00:05:08.490
which they will,

00:05:08.514 --> 00:05:12.201
in six years, they're not going to be two
times better or four times better,

00:05:12.201 --> 00:05:15.128
they'll be 16 times better
than they are right now.

00:05:15.622 --> 00:05:19.474
So I start to think a lot of knowledge
work is going to be affected by this.

00:05:19.492 --> 00:05:22.994
And digital technologies are not
just impacting knowledge work,

00:05:23.252 --> 00:05:26.803
they're starting to flex their muscles
in the physical world as well.

00:05:26.864 --> 00:05:30.525
I had the chance a little while back
to ride in the Google `autonomous` car,

00:05:30.652 --> 00:05:32.929
which is as cool as it sounds.

00:05:32.950 --> 00:05:35.138
(Laughter)

00:05:35.159 --> 00:05:39.538
And I will vouch that it handled
the stop-and-go traffic on US 101

00:05:39.559 --> 00:05:40.812
very smoothly.

00:05:40.833 --> 00:05:44.470
There are about three and a half million
people who drive trucks for a living

00:05:44.470 --> 00:05:45.662
in the United States;

00:05:45.662 --> 00:05:48.843
I think some of them are going
to be affected by this technology.

00:05:48.843 --> 00:05:51.999
And right now, humanoid robots
are still incredibly primitive.

00:05:52.068 --> 00:05:54.025
They can't do very much.

00:05:54.046 --> 00:05:56.018
But they're getting better quite quickly

00:05:56.042 --> 00:05:59.445
and DARPA, which is the investment arm
of the Defense Department,

00:05:59.603 --> 00:06:01.580
is trying to accelerate their trajectory.

00:06:01.604 --> 00:06:05.894
So, in short, yeah, the droids
are coming for our jobs.

00:06:07.245 --> 00:06:10.137
In the short term, we can
stimulate job growth

00:06:10.161 --> 00:06:12.298
by encouraging entrepreneurship

00:06:12.322 --> 00:06:14.236
and by investing in infrastructure,

00:06:14.260 --> 00:06:17.613
because the robots today
still aren't very good at fixing bridges.

00:06:17.822 --> 00:06:19.720
But in the not-too-long-term,

00:06:19.744 --> 00:06:22.891
I think within the lifetimes
of most of the people in this room,

00:06:23.670 --> 00:06:27.146
we're going to transition into an economy
that is very productive,

00:06:27.242 --> 00:06:30.136
but that just doesn't need
a lot of human workers.

00:06:30.160 --> 00:06:33.320
And managing that transition
is going to be the greatest challenge

00:06:33.320 --> 00:06:34.834
that our society faces.

00:06:34.858 --> 00:06:36.808
Voltaire summarized why; he said,

00:06:36.832 --> 00:06:41.788
"Work saves us from three great evils:
boredom, vice and need."

00:06:42.570 --> 00:06:44.627
But despite this challenge --

00:06:44.651 --> 00:06:47.563
personally, I'm still
a huge digital optimist,

00:06:47.587 --> 00:06:49.791
and I am supremely confident

00:06:49.815 --> 00:06:52.403
that the digital technologies
that we're developing now

00:06:52.427 --> 00:06:55.077
are going to take us
into a Utopian future,

00:06:55.101 --> 00:06:56.813
not a dystopian future.

00:06:56.837 --> 00:06:57.988
And to explain why,

00:06:58.012 --> 00:07:00.591
I want to pose a ridiculously
broad question.

00:07:00.615 --> 00:07:01.766
I want to ask:

00:07:01.790 --> 00:07:05.063
what have been the most important
developments in human history?

00:07:05.160 --> 00:07:08.121
Now, I want to share some
of the answers that I've gotten

00:07:08.145 --> 00:07:09.542
in response to this question.

00:07:09.566 --> 00:07:12.776
It's a wonderful question to ask
and start an endless debate about,

00:07:12.776 --> 00:07:14.788
because some people are going to bring up

00:07:14.788 --> 00:07:17.823
systems of philosophy
in both the West and the East

00:07:18.080 --> 00:07:21.080
that have changed how a lot
of people think about the world.

00:07:21.327 --> 00:07:22.820
And then other people will say,

00:07:22.844 --> 00:07:25.305
"No, actually, the big stories,
the big developments

00:07:25.329 --> 00:07:27.912
are the founding
of the world's major religions,

00:07:27.936 --> 00:07:30.936
which have changed civilizations
and have changed and influenced

00:07:31.186 --> 00:07:33.780
how countless people
are living their lives."

00:07:33.804 --> 00:07:35.501
And then some other folk will say,

00:07:35.525 --> 00:07:37.915
"Actually, what changes civilizations,

00:07:37.939 --> 00:07:42.488
what modifies them and what changes
people's lives are empires,

00:07:42.748 --> 00:07:45.153
so the great developments in human history

00:07:45.177 --> 00:07:47.939
are stories of conquest and of war."

00:07:47.963 --> 00:07:50.744
And then some cheery soul
usually always pipes up and says,

00:07:50.768 --> 00:07:52.450
"Hey, don't forget about plagues!"

00:07:52.474 --> 00:07:55.474
(Laughter)

00:07:56.407 --> 00:07:58.930
There are some optimistic
answers to this question,

00:07:58.954 --> 00:08:01.368
so some people will bring up
the Age of Exploration

00:08:01.392 --> 00:08:02.937
and the opening up of the world.

00:08:02.961 --> 00:08:06.688
Others will talk about intellectual
achievements in disciplines like math

00:08:06.763 --> 00:08:09.257
that have helped us get
a better handle on the world,

00:08:09.281 --> 00:08:12.678
and other folk will talk about periods
when there was a deep flourishing

00:08:12.745 --> 00:08:14.350
of the arts and sciences.

00:08:14.374 --> 00:08:15.961
So this debate will go on and on.

00:08:15.985 --> 00:08:17.446
It's an endless debate

00:08:17.470 --> 00:08:20.470
and there's no conclusive,
single answer to it.

00:08:20.727 --> 00:08:22.244
But if you're a geek like me,

00:08:22.268 --> 00:08:24.949
you say, "Well, what do the data say?"

00:08:24.973 --> 00:08:26.305
And you start to do things

00:08:26.329 --> 00:08:29.013
like graph things
that we might be interested in --

00:08:29.037 --> 00:08:32.037
the total worldwide
population, for example,

00:08:32.140 --> 00:08:34.505
or some measure of social development

00:08:34.529 --> 00:08:37.017
or the state of advancement of a society.

00:08:37.041 --> 00:08:40.041
And you start to plot the data,
because, by this approach,

00:08:41.188 --> 00:08:43.793
the big stories, the big
developments in human history,

00:08:43.817 --> 00:08:46.327
are the ones that will bend
these curves a lot.

00:08:46.351 --> 00:08:48.571
So when you do this
and when you plot the data,

00:08:48.595 --> 00:08:51.287
you pretty quickly come
to some weird conclusions.

00:08:51.311 --> 00:08:52.707
You conclude, actually,

00:08:52.731 --> 00:08:55.294
that none of these things
have mattered very much.

00:08:55.318 --> 00:08:58.318
(Laughter)

00:08:59.380 --> 00:09:02.380
They haven't done
a darn thing to the curves.

00:09:02.757 --> 00:09:07.424
There has been one story,
one development in human history

00:09:07.471 --> 00:09:10.471
that bent the curve,
bent it just about 90 degrees,

00:09:10.704 --> 00:09:12.839
and it is a technology story.

00:09:13.363 --> 00:09:16.133
The steam engine and the other
associated technologies

00:09:16.157 --> 00:09:18.188
of the Industrial Revolution

00:09:18.212 --> 00:09:21.212
changed the world and influenced
human history so much,

00:09:21.512 --> 00:09:23.914
that in the words
of the historian Ian Morris,

00:09:23.938 --> 00:09:26.938
"... they made mockery out of all
that had come before."

00:09:27.753 --> 00:09:31.222
And they did this by infinitely
multiplying the power of our muscles,

00:09:31.304 --> 00:09:33.698
overcoming the limitations of our muscles.

00:09:33.722 --> 00:09:36.220
Now, what we're in the middle of now

00:09:36.244 --> 00:09:39.244
is overcoming the limitations
of our individual brains

00:09:39.301 --> 00:09:42.212
and infinitely multiplying
our mental power.

00:09:42.236 --> 00:09:45.236
How can this not be as big a deal

00:09:45.437 --> 00:09:48.141
as overcoming the limitations
of our muscles?

00:09:48.165 --> 00:09:51.025
So at the risk of repeating
myself a little bit,

00:09:51.049 --> 00:09:54.543
when I look at what's going on
with digital technology these days,

00:09:54.635 --> 00:09:57.635
we are not anywhere near
through with this journey.

00:09:57.960 --> 00:10:01.348
And when I look at what is happening
to our economies and our societies,

00:10:01.490 --> 00:10:04.490
my single conclusion is that
we ain't seen nothing yet.

00:10:04.603 --> 00:10:06.329
The best days are really ahead.

00:10:06.353 --> 00:10:08.354
Let me give you a couple examples.

00:10:08.378 --> 00:10:10.751
Economies don't run on energy.

00:10:11.375 --> 00:10:14.375
They don't run on capital,
they don't run on labor.

00:10:14.438 --> 00:10:16.843
Economies run on ideas.

00:10:16.867 --> 00:10:19.867
So the work of innovation,
the work of coming up with new ideas,

00:10:20.232 --> 00:10:23.872
is some of the most powerful, most
fundamental work that we can do

00:10:23.954 --> 00:10:25.105
in an economy.

00:10:25.129 --> 00:10:28.129
And this is kind of how
we used to do innovation.

00:10:28.271 --> 00:10:31.247
We'd find a bunch of fairly
similar-looking people...

00:10:31.271 --> 00:10:34.271
(Laughter)

00:10:34.791 --> 00:10:36.784
We'd take them out of elite institutions,

00:10:36.808 --> 00:10:38.887
we'd put them into other
elite institutions

00:10:38.911 --> 00:10:40.497
and we'd wait for the innovation.

00:10:40.521 --> 00:10:41.690
Now --

00:10:41.714 --> 00:10:44.143
(Laughter)

00:10:44.167 --> 00:10:47.401
as a white guy who spent
his whole career at MIT and Harvard,

00:10:47.679 --> 00:10:49.705
I've got no problem with this.

00:10:49.729 --> 00:10:52.085
(Laughter)

00:10:53.345 --> 00:10:54.552
But some other people do,

00:10:54.576 --> 00:10:56.361
and they've kind of crashed the party

00:10:56.385 --> 00:10:58.530
and loosened up
the dress code of innovation.

00:10:58.554 --> 00:10:59.586
(Laughter)

00:10:59.610 --> 00:11:02.610
So here are the winners of a Topcoder
programming challenge,

00:11:02.834 --> 00:11:05.526
and I assure you that nobody cares

00:11:05.550 --> 00:11:09.073
where these kids grew up,
where they went to school,

00:11:09.094 --> 00:11:10.594
or what they look like.

00:11:10.757 --> 00:11:14.557
All anyone cares about is the quality
of the work, the quality of the ideas.

00:11:14.721 --> 00:11:16.957
And over and over again,
we see this happening

00:11:16.981 --> 00:11:19.505
in the technology-facilitated world.

00:11:19.529 --> 00:11:22.026
The work of innovation
is becoming more open,

00:11:22.050 --> 00:11:25.512
more inclusive, more transparent
and more merit-based,

00:11:25.723 --> 00:11:29.375
and that's going to continue no matter
what MIT and Harvard think of it,

00:11:29.445 --> 00:11:32.165
and I couldn't be happier
about that development.

00:11:32.349 --> 00:11:34.804
I hear once in a while,
"OK, I'll grant you that,

00:11:34.828 --> 00:11:37.828
but technology is still a tool
for the rich world,

00:11:37.871 --> 00:11:39.270
and what's not happening,

00:11:39.294 --> 00:11:41.905
these digital tools are not
improving the lives

00:11:41.929 --> 00:11:44.078
of people at the bottom of the pyramid."

00:11:44.102 --> 00:11:46.768
And I want to say to that
very clearly: nonsense.

00:11:46.792 --> 00:11:50.157
The bottom of the pyramid is benefiting
hugely from technology.

00:11:50.309 --> 00:11:53.652
The economist Robert Jensen
did this wonderful study a while back

00:11:53.893 --> 00:11:55.826
where he watched, in great detail,

00:11:55.850 --> 00:11:58.850
what happened to the fishing
villages of Kerala, India,

00:11:59.492 --> 00:12:02.373
when they got mobile phones
for the very first time.

00:12:02.397 --> 00:12:05.206
And when you write for the Quarterly
Journal of Economics,

00:12:05.230 --> 00:12:08.112
you have to use very dry
and very circumspect language.

00:12:08.136 --> 00:12:09.398
But when I read his paper,

00:12:09.422 --> 00:12:11.629
I kind of feel Jensen
is trying to scream at us

00:12:11.653 --> 00:12:13.977
and say, "Look, this was a big deal.

00:12:14.001 --> 00:12:17.001
Prices stabilized, so people
could plan their economic lives.

00:12:17.596 --> 00:12:20.860
Waste was not reduced --
it was eliminated.

00:12:21.747 --> 00:12:23.988
And the lives of both
the buyers and the sellers

00:12:24.012 --> 00:12:26.486
in these villages measurably improved."

00:12:26.813 --> 00:12:30.593
Now, what I don't think
is that Jensen got extremely lucky

00:12:30.627 --> 00:12:32.838
and happened to land
in the one set of villages

00:12:32.862 --> 00:12:35.171
where technology made things better.

00:12:35.195 --> 00:12:37.842
What happened instead
is he very carefully documented

00:12:37.866 --> 00:12:41.849
what happens over and over again
when technology comes for the first time

00:12:41.969 --> 00:12:43.906
to an environment and a community:

00:12:43.930 --> 00:12:47.436
the lives of people, the welfares
of people, improve dramatically.

00:12:47.791 --> 00:12:49.672
So as I look around at all the evidence

00:12:49.696 --> 00:12:52.133
and I think about the room
that we have ahead of us,

00:12:52.157 --> 00:12:53.985
I become a huge digital optimist

00:12:54.009 --> 00:12:58.535
and I start to think that this wonderful
statement from the physicist Freeman Dyson

00:12:58.609 --> 00:13:00.347
is actually not hyperbole.

00:13:00.371 --> 00:13:02.880
This is an accurate assessment
of what's going on.

00:13:02.904 --> 00:13:05.602
Our technologies are great gifts,

00:13:05.626 --> 00:13:08.626
and we, right now,
have the great good fortune

00:13:08.657 --> 00:13:12.201
to be living at a time when
digital technology is flourishing,

00:13:12.451 --> 00:13:15.568
when it is broadening and deepening
and becoming more profound

00:13:15.726 --> 00:13:17.004
all around the world.

00:13:17.029 --> 00:13:20.311
So, yeah, the droids are taking our jobs,

00:13:20.471 --> 00:13:23.471
but focusing on that fact
misses the point entirely.

00:13:24.066 --> 00:13:27.066
The point is that then we
are freed up to do other things,

00:13:27.590 --> 00:13:29.877
and what we're going to do,
I am very confident,

00:13:29.901 --> 00:13:32.417
what we're going to do is reduce poverty

00:13:32.441 --> 00:13:34.910
and drudgery and misery around the world.

00:13:34.934 --> 00:13:38.523
I'm very confident we're going to learn
to live more lightly on the planet,

00:13:38.963 --> 00:13:42.380
and I am extremely confident
that what we're going to do

00:13:42.412 --> 00:13:43.787
with our new digital tools

00:13:43.811 --> 00:13:46.803
is going to be so profound
and so beneficial

00:13:46.827 --> 00:13:50.278
that it's going to make a mockery
out of everything that came before.

00:13:50.335 --> 00:13:51.891
I'm going to leave the last word

00:13:51.915 --> 00:13:54.569
to a guy who had a front-row seat
for digital progress,

00:13:54.593 --> 00:13:56.165
our old friend Ken Jennings.

00:13:56.189 --> 00:13:58.432
I'm with him; I'm going to echo his words:

00:13:58.456 --> 00:14:01.372
"I, for one, welcome our new
computer overlords."

00:14:01.396 --> 00:14:02.477
(Laughter)

00:14:02.501 --> 00:14:03.985
Thanks very much.

00:14:04.009 --> 00:14:05.167
(Applause)
