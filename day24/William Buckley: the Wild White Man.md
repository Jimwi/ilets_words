DES COWLEY: My name's Des Cowley of the Rare
Printed Collections at the State Library,

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:05.380
Victoria.

00:00:05.380 --> 00:00:10.050
What I'm going to show you is a range of early
documents and printed material relating to

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:12.809
the story of the escaped convict William Buckley.

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:21.150
Now, the earliest recorded document relating
to the story is John Batman's journal.

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:27.119
Batman travelled in May of 1835 to Port Phillip
with the express purpose of making a treaty

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:31.839
with the local Aborigines to acquire 600,000
acres of land.

00:00:31.839 --> 00:00:36.590
And it was on the 6th of June in that year
that he records having made a treaty with

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:38.440
the Aboriginal population.

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:45.710
This is the deed that according to Batman
was signed during that visit to Port Phillip

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:50.480
and this records the transaction between Batman
and the local Aborigines.

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:56.679
Now, we can see the supposed mark of the local
chiefs as Batman referred to them and also

00:00:56.679 --> 00:01:00.129
the marks of the witnesses including Todd.

00:01:00.129 --> 00:01:03.890
Batman also had with him seven Aborigines
from New South Wales who were meant to act

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:04.890
as interpreters.

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:09.780
But of course with different dialects, they
were unable to carry out that role.

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:15.251
When Batman returns to Hobart on the 8th of
June, 1835, he leaves at his camp three of

00:01:15.251 --> 00:01:16.880
his servants including William Todd.

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:22.750
Todd's the only literate member of the group
and in fact, Batman leaves a small journal

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:28.090
with Todd and asks him to keep a record of
activities at the camp until he returns.

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:32.829
This is in many ways where the documentary
recording of Buckley's story really takes

00:01:32.829 --> 00:01:38.380
place because it's Todd who records for the
very first time Buckley coming into Batman's

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:44.070
camp at Indented Head on 6th July and he describes
him in some detail.

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:49.539
And Todd, in fact, interestingly enough, records
the tattoo on Buckley's arm which has a WB

00:01:49.539 --> 00:01:55.689
for 'Buckley' and it has a sun and a moon
and a small creature.

00:01:55.689 --> 00:01:59.929
Buckley at this stage has lost most of his
language skills and is unable to communicate.

00:01:59.929 --> 00:02:03.760
But when he's given bread, the word 'bread'
triggers something and he's suddenly able

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:07.969
to start to remember the language he hasn't
used since 1803.

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:12.780
Todd's journal, in a sense, records the first
meeting, the pivotal moment when Buckley in

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:16.750
fact re-enters European society.

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:22.010
In August 1835, John Batman returned to the
Port Phillip district, the camp at Indented

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:26.380
Head, and brought with him John Helder Wedge,
a surveyor who was also a member of the Port

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:28.490
Phillip Association.

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:33.930
It was Wedge's role to actually survey the
claim of land that in fact had been part of

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:35.150
the treaty with the local Aborigines.

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:40.990
This is the very first manuscript map which
documents the area and we see on it the camp

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:43.530
marked at Indented Head,

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:48.100
we see what's referred to as Wedge's Range,
we have the track that Batman took on his

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:50.980
original survey of the area.

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:54.660
Buckley assisted Wedge on his surveying of
the region.

00:02:54.660 --> 00:03:00.060
He assisted with Aboriginal words for regions
and we see here that Geelong is taken from

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:01.060
the Aboriginal.

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:07.940
He helped as an interpreter and in fact, Wedge
also names Buckley Falls after William Buckley.

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:12.100
When Wedge carries out his survey of the Port
Phillip district, he keeps with him a field

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:16.130
book, records the notes of his journey as
well as illustrations.

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:19.790
He records, again, details of Buckley.

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:26.750
But what we also find is the very first illustration
of William Buckley, sitting there in the camp

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:30.170
looking extremely unhappy with his situation.

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:33.550
And again, we see Buckley clothed on the very
next page.

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:39.090
When Governor Bourke in New South Wales first
hears of Buckley's tale, he finds it fascinating

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:44.130
and in fact states,'It would be good if someone
could actually take down Buckley's story.'

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:49.480
In 1837, the Reverend Langhorne who was based
in Port Phillip records Buckley's story for

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:51.090
the very first time.

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:54.490
This is actually the manuscript of Langhorne's
account.

00:03:54.490 --> 00:03:59.710
It only runs to several pages but in fact
it's the earliest document that we have where

00:03:59.710 --> 00:04:03.050
Buckley in fact tells his own story.

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:07.500
Langhorne stated that he found it difficult
to converse with Buckley.

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:12.040
Buckley's language skills were still very
basic at the time but it's recorded in the

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:16.810
first person and Buckley tells a narrative
recounting those 32 years.

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:21.709
It's an important document because it's the
closest we have to the source and the account

00:04:21.709 --> 00:04:24.370
of Buckley at the actual time of the events.

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:29.889
It was a little-known document and it wasn't
published until the first time in 1911 in

00:04:29.889 --> 00:04:32.490
The Age newspaper.

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:41.889
In 1848 in April, a fiction about the life
of Buckley was published in the Geelong Advertiser.

00:04:41.889 --> 00:04:47.419
It was entitled Waroon The Strong: A Tale
Illustrative Of The Times Of Buckley.

00:04:47.419 --> 00:04:51.669
And it was serialised through a number of
issues in the paper over the coming weeks.

00:04:51.669 --> 00:04:57.020
It's entirely fictitious work and at one stage
has Buckley wielding a cutlass in one of his

00:04:57.020 --> 00:04:58.870
many battles.

00:04:58.870 --> 00:05:04.710
Buckley in fact wrote to the Geelong Advertiser
to complain about the inaccuracy of the tale

00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:11.960
and stated that forthcoming would be a book
that told his own story.

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:18.789
In 1852, the story that Buckley mentions in
his letter to the Geelong paper is published.

00:05:18.789 --> 00:05:21.460
It's entitled The Life And Adventures Of William
Buckley.

00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:26.749
It's ghosted by John Morgan who was a journalist
in Tasmania at the time in Hobart and he states

00:05:26.749 --> 00:05:30.720
in the introduction that he was approached
by Buckley with a view to telling his own

00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:31.720
story.

00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:35.960
The title page and the frontispiece includes
a portrait of Buckley done by Ludwig Becker

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:40.120
who would later gain fame as the artist on
the Burke and Wills expedition.

00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:45.230
Now, Morgan's book is extremely important
because it's the fullest account we have.

00:05:45.230 --> 00:05:50.849
It's hard to know where the ghosting starts
and stops but many later commentators believe

00:05:50.849 --> 00:05:53.780
in fact it's probably a quite accurate record.

00:05:53.780 --> 00:06:00.129
A second book on Buckley is published in 1856
by the local historian James Bonwick.

00:06:00.129 --> 00:06:03.009
It's entitled the Wild White Man And The Blacks
Of Victoria.

00:06:03.009 --> 00:06:08.300
In many ways, this is where the phrase 'the
wild white man' really enters our culture.

00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:10.659
Bonwick never actually met Buckley.

00:06:10.659 --> 00:06:14.220
He's very critical of Morgan's account and
some commentators have assumed that may be

00:06:14.220 --> 00:06:18.160
sour grapes because he didn't have the first-hand
story himself.

00:06:18.160 --> 00:06:24.840
He's quite harsh about Buckley, talks of him
being of low intelligence, etc.

00:06:24.840 --> 00:06:31.479
Bonwick would in fact offer a much more sympathetic
portrait later, in 1883 when he published

00:06:31.479 --> 00:06:34.150
his massive history of the Port Phillip settlement.

00:06:34.150 --> 00:06:39.969
Up till now, it's been very much an Australian
story but the News Letter Of Australasia in

00:06:39.969 --> 00:06:44.779
1857 publishes the William Buckley story.

00:06:44.779 --> 00:06:50.229
Buckley's story for the very first time reaches
across to England and is popularised there

00:06:50.229 --> 00:06:51.449
through the News Letter Of Australasia.

00:06:51.449 --> 00:06:57.719
In the last 20 years of the 19th century,
an Aboriginal artist Tommy McRae who lived

00:06:57.719 --> 00:07:02.090
in the Upper Murray region painted a number
of sketches.

00:07:02.090 --> 00:07:06.270
Amongst these, he included the image of Buckley
and it's a very different Buckley that we

00:07:06.270 --> 00:07:09.319
see from an Indigenous standpoint.

00:07:09.319 --> 00:07:12.020
We see Buckley participating in a corroboree.

00:07:12.020 --> 00:07:18.469
The title of this particular work is Buckley
Ran Away From The Ship, from 1870.

00:07:18.469 --> 00:07:23.449
It goes back to the Langhorne account where
Buckley speaks of the fact that he was aware

00:07:23.449 --> 00:07:29.319
at various times of Europeans in the coastal
area, possibly sailors, and yet had made decisions

00:07:29.319 --> 00:07:30.979
not to make contact.

00:07:30.979 --> 00:07:35.319
And it's not really until 1980 onwards that
Buckley's story returns to us.

00:07:35.319 --> 00:07:39.939
One of the key works was Craig Robertson's
novel, Buckley's Hope which was published

00:07:39.939 --> 00:07:40.939
in 1980.

00:07:40.939 --> 00:07:45.159
And we also have Barry Hill's - a long sequence
of poems - Ghosting William Buckley which

00:07:45.159 --> 00:07:50.069
was an important work that did a lot to restitute
Buckley in the popular imagination.

00:07:50.069 --> 00:07:55.270
And Buckley's also been an influence on writers
such as David Malouf whose work Remembering

00:07:55.270 --> 00:08:00.779
Babylon gives a similar account of a European
who spends many years in Australia with the

00:08:00.779 --> 00:08:01.779
Aborigines.

00:08:01.779 --> 00:08:07.139
You'll also find imagery that turns up in
painters such as Jan Senbergs and Juan Davila

00:08:07.139 --> 00:08:12.389
so it's interesting in ways that Buckley,
as a sense, returned as part of the dialogue

00:08:12.389 --> 00:08:15.209
that's ongoing in terms of `reconciliation`
today.
