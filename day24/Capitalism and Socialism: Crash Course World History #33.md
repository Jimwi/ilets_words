00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:04.810
Hi, I'm John Green, this is Crash Course World
History, and today we're going to talk about capitalism.

00:00:04.810 --> 00:00:09.240
Yeah, Mr. Green, capitalism just turns men
into wolves. Your purportedly free markets

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:11.150
only makes slave of us all..

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:14.599
Oh god Stan, it's me from college. Me from
the past has become me from college. This

00:00:14.599 --> 00:00:18.440
is a disaster! The reason he's so unbearable,
Stan, is that he refuses to recognize the

00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:22.980
legitimacy of other people's narratives. And
that means that he will never ever be able

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:26.130
to have a productive conversation with another
human in his entire life.

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:29.519
So listen, me from the past. I'm gonna disappoint
you by being too capitalist. And I'm gonna

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:32.770
disappoint a lot of other people by not being
capitalist enough. And I'm gonna disappoint

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:37.300
the historians by not using enough jargon.
But what can I do? We only have twelve minutes!

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:39.230
Fortunately, capitalism is all about efficiency.

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:42.530
So let's do this, me from college: Randy [Ransom]
Riggs becomes a best-selling author, Josh

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:47.030
Radnor stars in a great sitcom, it is NOT
going to work out with Emily, and do NOT go

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:50.350
to Alaska with a girl you've known for ten
days. Okay, let's talk capitalism.

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:03.059
So capitalism is an economic system, but it's
also a cultural system. It's characterized

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:06.880
by innovation and investment to increase wealth.
But today, we're going to focus on production

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:10.850
and how industrial capitalism changed it.
Stan, I can't wear these `emblems` of the bourgeoisie

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:16.900
while Karl Marx himself is looking at me,
it's ridiculous.

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:21.420
I'm changing! Very hard to take off a shirt
dramatically.

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:25.720
So let's say it's 1200 CE and you're a rug
merchant. Just like merchants today, you sometimes

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:29.840
need to borrow money in order to buy the rugs
you want to resell at a profit, and then you

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:33.970
pay that money back, often with interest,
once you've resold the rugs. This is called

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:37.479
mercantile capitalism, and it was a global
phenomenon, from the Chinese, to the Indian

00:01:37.479 --> 00:01:41.759
Ocean trade network, to Muslim merchants who
would sponsor trade caravans across the Sahara.

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:45.310
But by the 17th century, merchants in the
Netherlands and in Britain had expanded upon

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:49.240
this idea to create joint stock companies.
Those companies could finance bigger trade

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:53.200
missions and also spread the risk of international
trade. But the thing about international trade

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:57.420
is that sometimes boats sink or they get taken
by pirates, and while that's bad if you're

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:01.280
a sailor because, you know, you lose your
life, it's really bad if you're a mercantile

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:05.759
capitalist because you lost all your money.
But if you own one-tenth of ten boats, your

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:09.440
risk is much better managed. That kind of
investment definitely increased wealth, but

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:14.620
it only affected a sliver of the population
and it didn't create a culture of capitalism.

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:18.440
Industrial capitalism was something altogether
different, both in scale and in practice.

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:22.620
Let's use Joyce Appleby's definition of industrial
capitalism: "An economic system that relies on

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:28.400
investment of capital in machines and technology that
are used to increase production of marketable goods."

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:32.220
So imagine that someone made a Stan machine
(by the way Stan, this is a remarkable likeness)

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:36.480
and that Stan machine could produce and direct
10 times more episodes of Crash Course than

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:41.120
a human Stan. Well, of course, even if there
are upfront costs I'm going to invest in a

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:45.080
Stan machine so I can start cranking out 10
times the knowledge - Stan, are you focusing

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:49.200
on the robot instead of me? I AM THE STAR
OF THE SHOW. Stanbot, you're going behind the globe.

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:52.680
So when most of us think about capitalism,
especially when we think about its downsides

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:57.909
- long hours, low wages, miserable working
conditions, child labor, unemployed Stans

00:02:57.909 --> 00:03:01.590
- that's what we're thinking about. Now admittedly,
this is just one definition of industrial

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:04.650
capitalism among many, but it's the definition
we're going with.

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:08.050
All right, let's go to the Thought Bubble.
Industrial capitalism developed first in Britain

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:11.800
in the 19th century. Britain had a bunch of
advantages - it was the dominant power on

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:15.440
the seas, and it was making good money off
its trade with its colonies, including the

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:20.250
slave trade; also, the growth of capitalism
was helped by the half-century of civil unrest

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:23.260
that resulted from the 17th century English
Civil War.

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:27.799
Now, I'm not advocating for civil wars or
anything but in this particular case it was

00:03:27.799 --> 00:03:31.849
useful because before the war, the British
crown had put a lot of regulations on the

00:03:31.849 --> 00:03:37.970
economy: complicated licenses, royal monopolies,
etc. But during the turmoil it couldn't enforce

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:40.280
them, which made for freer markets.

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:44.959
Another factor was a remarkable increase in
agricultural productivity in the 16th century.

00:03:44.959 --> 00:03:49.629
As food prices started to rise, it became
profitable for farmers, both large and small,

00:03:49.629 --> 00:03:54.519
to invest in agricultural technologies that
would improve crop yields. Those higher prices

00:03:54.519 --> 00:03:59.060
for grain probably resulted from population
growth, which in turn was encouraged by increased

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:00.269
production of food crops.

00:04:00.269 --> 00:04:04.030
A number of these agricultural improvements
came from the Dutch, who had chronic problems

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:08.120
feeding themselves, and discovered that planting
different kinds of crops, like clover, that

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:12.090
added nitrogen to the soil and could be used
to feed livestock at the same time, meant

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:15.909
that more fields could be used at once. This
increased productivity, eventually brought

00:04:15.909 --> 00:04:21.240
down prices, and this encouraged further innovation in
order to increase yield to make up for the drop in prices.

00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:25.620
Lower food prices had an added benefit: since
food cost less and wages in England remained

00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:29.540
high, workers would have more disposable income,
which meant that if there were consumer goods

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:34.780
available, they would be consumed, which incentivized
people to make consumer goods more efficiently,

00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:38.570
and therefore more cheaply. You can see how
this positive feedback loop leads to more

00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:43.410
food, and more stuff, culminating in a world
where people have so much stuff that we must

00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:49.199
rent space to store it, and so much food that
obesity has become a bigger killer than starvation.

00:04:49.199 --> 00:04:50.340
Thanks, Thought Bubble.

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:54.419
So this increased productivity also meant
that fewer people needed to work in agriculture

00:04:54.419 --> 00:04:59.440
in order to feed the population. To put this
in perspective, in 1520, 80% of the English

00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:05.669
population worked the land. By 1800, only
36% of adult male laborers were working in

00:05:05.669 --> 00:05:09.400
agriculture, and by 1850, that percentage
had dropped to 25.

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:12.560
This meant that when the factories started
humming, there were plenty of workers to hum

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:19.449
along with them. Especially child laborers.
So far all this sounds pretty good, right?

00:05:19.449 --> 00:05:25.580
I mean, except for the child labor - who wouldn't
want more, cheaper food? Yeah, well, not so fast.

00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:28.919
One of the ways the British achieved all this
agricultural productivity was through the

00:05:28.919 --> 00:05:33.780
process of enclosure, whereby landlords would
reclaim and privatize fields that for centuries

00:05:33.780 --> 00:05:37.850
had been held in common by multiple tenants.
This increased agricultural productivity,

00:05:37.850 --> 00:05:41.610
but it also impoverished many tenant farmers,
many of whom lost their livelihoods.

00:05:41.610 --> 00:05:46.350
Okay, for our purposes capitalism is also
a cultural system, rooted in the need of private

00:05:46.350 --> 00:05:51.590
investors to turn a profit. So the real change
needed here was a change of mind. People had

00:05:51.590 --> 00:05:56.150
to develop the capitalist values of taking
risks and appreciating innovation. And they

00:05:56.150 --> 00:05:59.940
had to come to believe that making an upfront
investment in something like a Stan Machine

00:05:59.940 --> 00:06:01.569
could pay for itself and then some.

00:06:01.569 --> 00:06:05.360
One of the reasons that these values developed
in Britain was that the people who initially

00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:09.259
held them were really good at publicizing
them. Writers like Thomas Mun, who worked

00:06:09.259 --> 00:06:12.979
for the English East India Company, exposed
people to the idea that the economy was controlled

00:06:12.979 --> 00:06:17.080
by markets. And other writers popularized
the idea that it was human nature for individuals

00:06:17.080 --> 00:06:19.660
to participate in markets as rational actors.

00:06:19.660 --> 00:06:25.710
Even our language changed: the word "individuals"
did not apply to persons until the 17th century.

00:06:25.710 --> 00:06:30.020
And in the 18th century, a "career" still
referred only to horses' racing lives.

00:06:30.020 --> 00:06:35.500
Perhaps the most important idea that was popularized
in England was that men and women were consumers

00:06:35.500 --> 00:06:40.470
as well as producers and that this was actually
a good thing because the desire to consume

00:06:40.470 --> 00:06:46.220
manufactured goods could spur economic growth.
"The main spur to trade, or rather to industry

00:06:46.220 --> 00:06:51.259
and `ingenuity`, is the `exorbitant` appetite
of men, which they will take pain to `gratify`,"

00:06:51.259 --> 00:06:56.960
so wrote John Cary, one of capitalism's cheerleaders,
in 1695, and in talking about our appetite,

00:06:56.960 --> 00:07:01.990
he wasn't just talking about food. That doesn't
seem radical now, but it sure did back then.

00:07:01.990 --> 00:07:07.150
So here in the 21st century it's clear that
industrial capitalism - at least for now - has

00:07:07.150 --> 00:07:12.139
won. [Aside to Marx] Sorry buddy, but you know,
you gave it a good run. You didn't know about Stalin.

00:07:12.139 --> 00:07:15.930
But capitalism isn't without its problems,
or its critics, and there were certainly lots

00:07:15.930 --> 00:07:19.940
of shortcomings to industrial capitalism in
the 19th century. Working conditions were

00:07:19.940 --> 00:07:25.039
awful. Days were long, arduous, and monotonous.
Workers lived in conditions that people living

00:07:25.039 --> 00:07:29.069
in the developed world today would associate
with abject poverty. One way that workers

00:07:29.069 --> 00:07:32.729
responded to these conditions was by organizing
into labor unions. Another response was in

00:07:32.729 --> 00:07:37.110
many cases purely theoretical: socialism,
most famously Marxian socialism.

00:07:37.110 --> 00:07:40.990
I should probably point out here that socialism
is an imperfect opposite to capitalism, even

00:07:40.990 --> 00:07:45.229
though the two are often juxtaposed. Capitalism’s
defenders like to point out that it’s “natural,”

00:07:45.229 --> 00:07:49.560
meaning that if left to our own devices, humans
would construct economic relationships that

00:07:49.560 --> 00:07:54.039
resemble capitalism. Socialism, at least in
its modern incarnations, makes fewer pretenses

00:07:54.040 --> 00:07:58.580
towards being an expression of human nature;
it’s the result of human choice and human planning.

00:07:58.580 --> 00:08:06.000
So, socialism, as an intellectual construct,
began in France. How’d I do, Stan? Mm, in

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:08.069
the border between Egypt and Libya.

00:08:08.069 --> 00:08:12.440
There were two branches of socialism in France,
Utopian and revolutionary. Utopian socialism

00:08:12.440 --> 00:08:16.569
is often associated with Comte de Saint Simon
and Charles Fourier, both of whom rejected

00:08:16.569 --> 00:08:20.569
revolutionary action after having seen the
disaster of the French Revolution.

00:08:20.569 --> 00:08:23.889
Both were critical of capitalism and while
Fourier is usually a punchline in history

00:08:23.889 --> 00:08:28.319
classes because he believed that, in his ideal
socialist world, the seas would turn to lemonade,

00:08:28.319 --> 00:08:32.339
he was right that human beings have desires
that go beyond basic self interest, and that

00:08:32.339 --> 00:08:34.839
we aren’t always economically rational actors.

00:08:34.839 --> 00:08:38.940
The other French socialists were the revolutionaries,
and they saw the French Revolution, even its

00:08:38.940 --> 00:08:42.550
violence, in a much more positive light. The
most important of these revolutionaries was

00:08:42.550 --> 00:08:46.860
Auguste Blanqui, and we associate a lot of
his ideas with communism, which is a term

00:08:46.860 --> 00:08:50.550
that he used. Like the Utopians, he criticized
capitalism, but he believed that it could

00:08:50.550 --> 00:08:54.360
only be overthrown through violent revolution
by the working classes.

00:08:54.360 --> 00:08:58.260
However, while Blanqui thought that the workers
would come to dominate a communist world,

00:08:58.260 --> 00:09:01.880
he was an elitist. And he believed that workers
on their own could never, on their own, overcome

00:09:01.880 --> 00:09:06.180
their superstitions and their prejudices in
order to throw off bourgeois oppression.

00:09:06.180 --> 00:09:11.300
And that brings us to Karl Marx, whose ideas
and beard cast a shadow over most of the 20th

00:09:11.300 --> 00:09:18.570
century. Oh, it’s time for the Open Letter?
An Open Letter to Karl Marx’s Beard.

00:09:18.570 --> 00:09:24.709
But, first, let’s see what’s in the secret
compartment today. Oh, robots. Stan Bots!

00:09:24.709 --> 00:09:30.470
Two Stan Bots, one of them female! Now I own
all the means of production. You’re officially

00:09:30.470 --> 00:09:34.850
useless to me, Stan. Now, turn the camera
off. Turn the ca-- I’m going to have to

00:09:34.850 --> 00:09:38.790
get up and turn the camera off? Stan Bot,
go turn the camera off.

00:09:38.790 --> 00:09:40.250
Hey there, Karl Marx’s beard.

00:09:40.250 --> 00:09:45.260
Wow, you are intense. Karl Marx, these days
there are a lot of young men who think beards

00:09:45.260 --> 00:09:48.630
are cool. Beard lovers, if you will. Those
aren’t beards, those are glorified milk

00:09:48.630 --> 00:09:51.800
mustaches. I mean, I haven’t shaved for
a couple weeks, Karl Marx, but I’m not claiming a beard.

00:09:51.800 --> 00:09:55.959
You don’t get a beard by being lazy, you
get a beard by being a committed revolutionary.

00:09:55.959 --> 00:10:01.230
That’s why hardcore Marxists are literally
known as “Bearded Marxists.” These days,

00:10:01.230 --> 00:10:05.070
that’s an insult. But you know what, Karl
Marx, when I look back at history, I prefer

00:10:05.070 --> 00:10:09.760
the bearded communists. Let’s talk about
some communists who didn’t have beards:

00:10:09.760 --> 00:10:14.899
Mao Zedong, Pol Pot, Kim Jong-il, Joseph freakin’
Stalin with his face caterpillar.

00:10:14.899 --> 00:10:19.029
So, yeah, Karl Marx’s beard, it’s my great
regret to inform you that there are some paltry

00:10:19.029 --> 00:10:22.209
beards trying to take up the class struggle
these days.

00:10:22.209 --> 00:10:23.550
Best Wishes, John Green

00:10:23.550 --> 00:10:27.100
Although he’s often considered the father
of communism, because he co-wrote The Communist

00:10:27.100 --> 00:10:31.450
Manifesto, Marx was above all a philosopher
and a historian. It’s just that, unlike

00:10:31.450 --> 00:10:34.860
many philosophers and historians, he advocated
for revolution.

00:10:34.860 --> 00:10:39.310
His greatest work, Das Kapital, sets out to
explain the world of the 19th century in historical

00:10:39.310 --> 00:10:43.610
and philosophical terms. Marx’s thinking
is deep and dense and we’re low on time,

00:10:43.610 --> 00:10:46.260
but I want to introduce one of his ideas,
that of class struggle.

00:10:46.260 --> 00:10:50.430
So, for Marx, the focus isn’t on the class,
it’s on the struggle. Basically Marx believed

00:10:50.430 --> 00:10:54.630
that classes don’t only struggle to make
history, but that the struggle is what makes

00:10:54.630 --> 00:10:59.060
classes into themselves. The idea is that
through conflict, classes develop a sense

00:10:59.060 --> 00:11:03.329
of themselves, and without conflict, there
is no such thing as class consciousness.

00:11:03.329 --> 00:11:07.290
So, Marx was writing in 19th century England
and there were two classes that mattered:

00:11:07.290 --> 00:11:12.180
the workers and the capitalists. The capitalists
owned most of the factors of production (in

00:11:12.180 --> 00:11:17.550
this case, land and the capital to invest
in factories). The workers just had their

00:11:17.550 --> 00:11:21.490
labor. So, the class struggle here is between
capitalists, who want labor at the lowest

00:11:21.490 --> 00:11:25.800
possible price, and the workers who want to
be paid as much as possible for their work.

00:11:25.800 --> 00:11:29.370
There are two key ideas that underlie this
theory of class struggle. First, Marx believed

00:11:29.370 --> 00:11:34.480
that “production,” or work, was the thing
that gave life material meaning. Second, is

00:11:34.480 --> 00:11:40.019
that we are by nature social animals. We work
together, we collaborate, we are more efficient

00:11:40.019 --> 00:11:41.930
when we share resources.

00:11:41.930 --> 00:11:47.850
Marx’s criticism of capitalism is that capitalism
replaces this egalitarian collaboration with

00:11:47.850 --> 00:11:52.550
conflict. And that means that it isn’t a
natural system after all. And by arguing that

00:11:52.550 --> 00:11:56.920
capitalism actually isn’t consistent with
human nature, Marx sought to empower the workers.

00:11:56.920 --> 00:12:01.570
That’s a lot more attractive than Blanqui’s
elitist socialism, and while purportedly Marxist

00:12:01.570 --> 00:12:07.070
states like the USSR usually abandon worker
empowerment pretty quickly, the idea of protecting

00:12:07.070 --> 00:12:10.470
our collective interest remains powerful.
That’s where we’ll have to leave it for

00:12:10.470 --> 00:12:12.740
now, lest I start reading from The Communist
Manifesto.

00:12:12.740 --> 00:12:17.100
But, ultimately socialism has not succeeded
in supplanting capitalism, as its proponents

00:12:17.100 --> 00:12:20.029
had hoped. In the United States, at least,
“socialism” has become something of a

00:12:20.029 --> 00:12:21.060
dirty word.

00:12:21.060 --> 00:12:24.630
So, industrial capitalism certainly seems
to have won out, and in terms of material

00:12:24.630 --> 00:12:29.820
well-being and access to goods and services for
people around the world, that’s probably a good thing.

00:12:29.820 --> 00:12:33.760
Ugh, you keep falling over. You’re a great
bit, but a very flimsy one. Actually, come

00:12:33.760 --> 00:12:35.360
to think of it, you’re more of an 8-bit.

00:12:35.380 --> 00:12:40.290
But how and to what extent we use socialist
principles to regulate free markets remains

00:12:40.290 --> 00:12:44.389
an open question, and one that is answered
very differently in, say, Sweden than in the

00:12:44.389 --> 00:12:48.420
United States. And this, I would argue, is
where Marx still matters.

00:12:48.420 --> 00:12:52.589
Is capitalist competition natural and good,
or should there be systems in place to check

00:12:52.589 --> 00:12:56.380
it for the sake of our collective well-being?
Should we band together to provide health

00:12:56.380 --> 00:13:00.740
care for the sick, or pensions for the old?
Should government run businesses, and if so,

00:13:00.740 --> 00:13:05.860
which ones? The mail delivery business? The
airport security business? The education business?

00:13:05.860 --> 00:13:10.079
Those are the places where industrial capitalism
and socialism are still competing. And in

00:13:10.079 --> 00:13:14.089
that sense, at least, the struggle continues.
Thanks for watching, I’ll see you next week.

00:13:14.089 --> 00:13:17.860
Crash Course is produced and directed by Stan
Muller. Our script supervisor is Danica Johnson.

00:13:17.860 --> 00:13:21.910
The show is written by my high school history
teacher, Raoul Meyer and myself. We’re ably

00:13:21.910 --> 00:13:25.410
interned by Meredith Danko. And our graphics
team is Thought Bubble.

00:13:25.410 --> 00:13:28.870
Last week’s phrase of the week was “the
TARDIS,” so you can stop suggesting that

00:13:28.870 --> 00:13:31.920
now! If you want to suggest future phrases
of the week or guess at this week’s, you

00:13:31.920 --> 00:13:35.149
can do so in comments, where you can also
ask questions about today’s video that will

00:13:35.149 --> 00:13:36.510
be answered by our team of historians.

00:13:36.510 --> 00:13:40.310
Thanks for watching Crash Course, and as we
say in my hometown, Don’t Forget To Be Awesome.

00:13:40.310 --> 00:13:43.000
All right, Stan, bring the movie magic...
Yes!
