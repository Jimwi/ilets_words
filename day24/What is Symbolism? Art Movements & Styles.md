What is Symbolism? Art Movements & Styles

1
00:00:09,820 --> 00:00:12,280
The 19th century was an era of great change

2
00:00:12,280 --> 00:00:14,088
for much of the Western world.

3
00:00:14,355 --> 00:00:16,480
Symbolism was in many ways a response

4
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:18,360
to the rapid industrialisation

5
00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:21,244
and scientific advances that were affecting society.

6
00:00:21,937 --> 00:00:23,066
It began in literature

7
00:00:23,170 --> 00:00:26,106
an expression of disenchantment with modern society

8
00:00:26,337 --> 00:00:28,613
but spread quickly to music and fine arts.

9
00:00:29,253 --> 00:00:31,280
The Symbolists were Avant-gardes,

10
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:34,106
a diverse group, often working independently

11
00:00:34,106 --> 00:00:36,100
in different styles and mediums.

12
00:00:37,111 --> 00:00:39,937
They sought escape from an increasingly grey reality

13
00:00:40,426 --> 00:00:43,840
by expressing dreams, visions and spirituality.

14
00:00:44,524 --> 00:00:47,620
Symbolist fine artists are identified by

15
00:00:47,620 --> 00:00:48,540
use of colour

16
00:00:48,540 --> 00:00:51,182
and flat, often abstract forms.

17
00:00:52,586 --> 00:00:54,284
Their work was often emotive

18
00:00:54,284 --> 00:00:56,280
with recurring themes:

19
00:00:56,560 --> 00:00:59,155
love, fear, anguish, death,

20
00:00:59,502 --> 00:01:01,928
sexual awakening and desire.

21
00:01:02,488 --> 00:01:05,990
Very different from the type of romantic or academic art

22
00:01:05,990 --> 00:01:07,790
that was favoured by the art establishment

23
00:01:07,790 --> 00:01:08,524
of the day.

24
00:01:10,684 --> 00:01:14,000
Odilon Redon was a forerunner of the Symbolist movement.

25
00:01:14,533 --> 00:01:19,004
His lithographic prints - lyrical and sinister - typify Symbolism

26
00:01:19,342 --> 00:01:21,928
by emphasising dreams and the imagination

27
00:01:22,764 --> 00:01:25,235
Illustrating Gustave Flaubert’s poem

28
00:01:25,528 --> 00:01:27,715
‘La Tentation de Saint-Antoine’

29
00:01:28,035 --> 00:01:29,710
(The Temptation of St. Anthony)

30
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:32,284
he showcased the move away from naturalism

31
00:01:32,835 --> 00:01:34,280
with his use of dream imagery

32
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:36,400
and strange, imaginary figures.

33
00:01:37,244 --> 00:01:40,684
Redon was an important influence on many later artists

34
00:01:41,128 --> 00:01:43,280
including his friend: Paul Gauguin

35
00:01:44,551 --> 00:01:47,130
Gauguin’s iconic painting 'Vision of the Sermon'

36
00:01:47,130 --> 00:01:49,600
was described by a critic in 1891

37
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:52,657
as "the first defining Symbolist painting".

38
00:01:53,297 --> 00:01:56,915
It illustrates a biblical story in which Jacob wrestles with an angel

39
00:01:57,617 --> 00:01:59,920
The flat forms and broad use of red

40
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:02,897
emphasises the unreal and dream-like image.

41
00:02:03,653 --> 00:02:06,622
They are seeing Jacob and the angel not physically,

42
00:02:07,022 --> 00:02:07,857
but as a vision.

43
00:02:08,693 --> 00:02:11,697
The tree represents the division between the real world

44
00:02:11,946 --> 00:02:14,080
and the interior space of the mind.

45
00:02:15,182 --> 00:02:18,000
Symbolism and its artistic rejection of the everyday

46
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,466
spread far beyond France.

47
00:02:19,688 --> 00:02:22,500
The Scottish artist Frances Macdonald McNair

48
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:26,311
produced experimental designs across a range of media.

49
00:02:26,826 --> 00:02:29,800
In 'Sleep', her gaunt stylised figures

50
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:32,035
inhabit an unreal space

51
00:02:32,195 --> 00:02:34,030
the place of dreams.

52
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:38,240
McNair’s work exhibits some of the decorative traits of Art Nouveau

53
00:02:38,408 --> 00:02:40,420
a movement that, like Symbolism

54
00:02:40,420 --> 00:02:42,871
emerged at the end of the nineteenth century.

55
00:02:44,266 --> 00:02:46,160
Symbolism influenced artists like

56
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:49,511
Picasso, Dali, Mondrian and Kandinsky.

57
00:02:49,911 --> 00:02:53,040
It also paved the way for a wide range of artistic movements

58
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:56,720
such as Expressionism, Surrealism, Abstraction

59
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:57,955
and more.

60
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:01,706
The Symbolist influence can still be seen today.

61
00:03:02,648 --> 00:03:05,706
Michael Armitage is an artist currently living and working

62
00:03:05,706 --> 00:03:07,700
between London and Nairobi.

63
00:03:07,902 --> 00:03:09,857
His paintings too are stories

64
00:03:09,857 --> 00:03:11,850
woven between different spaces

65
00:03:12,133 --> 00:03:14,290
historical and contemporary news

66
00:03:14,290 --> 00:03:16,782
internet gossip and memory.

67
00:03:17,911 --> 00:03:20,151
Armitage is by no means a symbolist,

68
00:03:20,435 --> 00:03:23,810
but in his 2016 painting 'Nasema Nawe'

69
00:03:23,810 --> 00:03:27,475
he makes direct reference to Gauguin’s Vision of the Sermon.

70
00:03:28,391 --> 00:03:30,648
In place of the Bretons and angels

71
00:03:30,915 --> 00:03:33,270
his composition shows spectators to

72
00:03:33,270 --> 00:03:35,235
women performing the Baikoko dance,

73
00:03:35,466 --> 00:03:37,351
a popular dance in Africa;

74
00:03:37,973 --> 00:03:40,620
but their stance, and the energy of the work

75
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:43,590
the flat colors and synthetic, dream-like quality

76
00:03:43,590 --> 00:03:44,702
is the same.

77
00:03:45,244 --> 00:03:48,728
Perhaps the lasting influence of symbolism should be no surprise.

78
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:53,768
Symbolism was a rejection of scientific and industrial advances

79
00:03:53,768 --> 00:03:55,760
and their impact on society.

80
00:03:56,746 --> 00:03:59,324
As we move in to a new technological age,

81
00:04:00,168 --> 00:04:03,253
what will the art world’s next response be?
