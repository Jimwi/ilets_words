1
00:00:01,970 --> 00:00:07,400
It can be so hard to forgive because – so
often – we simply are in the right and the

2
00:00:07,400 --> 00:00:14,640
scale of the folly, thoughtlessness and meanness
of others seems utterly beyond our own measure.

3
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:20,250
But there are two inviolable ideas which should
nevertheless, in the face of the grossest

4
00:00:20,250 --> 00:00:27,080
behavior, be kept in mind to increase our
chances of being able to forgive.

5
00:00:27,080 --> 00:00:35,000
Firstly: we must remember how the other person
got there, to this place of idiocy and cruelty.

6
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:41,580
Every irritating fault in another person has
a long history behind it. They have become

7
00:00:41,580 --> 00:00:47,190
like this because of flaws in their development,
which they did not choose for themselves.

8
00:00:47,190 --> 00:00:54,610
They were shaped by troubles which we cannot
see but which we can know exist. The arrogant

9
00:00:54,610 --> 00:01:00,420
person was trapped (at some key point in their
personal evolution) in an environment where

10
00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:05,829
being modest and reasonable seemed to guarantee
they’d be trampled on. The hyper-critical

11
00:01:05,829 --> 00:01:11,140
individual has lived too much, as their personality
was growing, around people who couldn’t

12
00:01:11,140 --> 00:01:17,760
take a gentle hint – so they came to rely
on blunt assertions. The frustratingly timid,

13
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:24,140
mousy person was (at some stage) terrified;
the show-off learned their irritating manner

14
00:01:24,140 --> 00:01:29,530
around people who were hard to please. Behind
every failing – behind everything that’s

15
00:01:29,530 --> 00:01:35,250
wrong and infuriating about those we meet
– is a decisive trauma encountered before

16
00:01:35,250 --> 00:01:41,909
someone could cope with it properly. They
are maddening but they got to be this way

17
00:01:41,909 --> 00:01:49,640
without meaning to. To forgive is to understand
the origins of evil and cruelty. Secondly,

18
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:56,250
and very strangely, there are difficult things
about you too. Of course, not in this area.

19
00:01:56,250 --> 00:02:01,270
Not in any area remotely connected to the
sort of lapses that destroy your faith in

20
00:02:01,270 --> 00:02:07,540
humanity. But in some areas, quiet areas that
you forget about as soon as you’ve travelled

21
00:02:07,540 --> 00:02:14,520
through them, you too are a deeply imperfect
and questionable individual. Gently, you have

22
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:21,450
– in your own way – betrayed. Nicely,
you have been a coward. Modestly, you have

23
00:02:21,450 --> 00:02:28,190
forgotten your privileges. Unthinkingly, you
have added salt to the wounds of others. We

24
00:02:28,190 --> 00:02:33,480
don’t need to know anything about you to
know this as a certainty. We must forgive

25
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:39,930
because – not right now, not over this,
but one day, over something – we need to

26
00:02:39,930 --> 00:02:46,709
be forgiven. We would – in the past – regularly
have looked up to the heavens for this forgiveness.

27
00:02:46,709 --> 00:02:54,640
We do that less and less. But that doesn’t
attenuate the need for some moments when we

28
00:02:54,640 --> 00:03:01,569
limber up to utter that most implausible word
‘sorry’ – or indeed stretch our ethical

29
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:10,080
imagination in order to pronounce those even
more arduous and unnatural words, ‘I forgive you.
