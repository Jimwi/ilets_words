History of Taste: Claude and the Old Masters | National Gallery

This painting was painted by Claude Lorrain, and it's a very important picture for the National Gallery's history because it shows precisely the type of taste currently `in vogue` when the National Gallery was founded, and opened its doors to the public, in 1824. It was painted for a man called the Duke of Bouillon. We know all about his commission because on the `masonry` here, in the bottom left hand corner of the painting, there's an inscription that says Claude Gellée painted this painting for his eminence the Duke of Bouillon, and then gives the date. When the National Gallery was founded, Lord Liverpool's government bought 38 paintings from the collection of an émigré, philanthropist and financier John Julius Angerstein. He was not a `nobleman`, but his taste was very much of the `aristocratic` kind. He managed to build up a collection of 38 old master paintings, including paintings by Raphael, Sebastiano del Piombo, Carraci, Rubens, and Rembrandt. In particular, Angerstein loved the work of Claude Lorrain, and he bought no fewer than five paintings by Claude. Before the National Gallery was founded, John Julius Angerstein was very `keen` that young artists should be able to come in and study his paintings. One of those who did was no other than J.M.W. Turner, and he cried and wept when he stood in front of a Claude like this, because he felt that he would never be able to `emulate` the great artist's work. When John Julius Angerstein died, his pictures were bought by the government, and when Turner died he also left his pictures to the nation, with the `proviso` that two of his works should hang forever more next to two works by Claude, in order that the British public and foreigners could judge the work of a native 19th-century British painter in comparison with a 17th-century French artist who had lived all his life in Italy. So when you come today, to Room 15, don't be surprised to see two works of Claude Lorrain hanging next to two works by Turner.
