Raising of America: DNA follow-up 

WEBVTT Kind: captions Language: en 

We think of DNA as the blueprint for our bodies, but now we know what happens to our bodies can change the instructions from our genes. What does that mean for the children of Colorado? Thank you for joining this conversation. I'm Laura Frank, president of news at Rocky Mountain PBS. We've just watched the documentary "DNA is not Destiny." It's part of the PBS series called Raising of America. And now some Colorado experts on child development will join some conversations we'll have about what the evolving research means, and how Colorado is protecting is its children. We have now with this Dr. Ayelet Talmi. She is associate professor in the Department of Psychiatry and `Pediatrics` at the University of Colorado School of Medicine and Associate Director of the Harris program. Dr. Talmi, can you tell us a little bit about what is the importance of environment and the effect on children as they develop? 

The environment is a salient context for development. In fact, it's a partner in development, because all children have their own internal capacity, what they bring to it. They have their relationships with their families and close `caregivers`. And then all of that happens in the context of different environments. So you can think about `intimate`, caregiving environments. You can think about neighborhoods and communities. You can think about schools. All of that, all the interactions in the systems that happen in the context of environments directly impact child development. 

And do you include health care that mix of what's directly impacting the genes that are functioning for children? 

Absolutely. We know so much about how social determinants of health impact long term health outcomes. And the health care system is one mode of intervention that actually allows us to provide high quality services universally to children and their families in ways that allow us to identify and then address concerns that happen in other environmental contexts. 

So really what you're saying is that the health care that a child gets can change the way the genes function in that child's body, but not just the health care, other what you call determinants of health. Help us understand what some of those are. 

Absolutely. Social determinants of health have everything to do, again, with the context and the quality of the context in which young children and then older children interact and experience all of the things that we think about as typical in development. So when we think about access to a health care system, or access to an educational system, access to safe communities, `nurturing` relationships, all of those factors are social determinants of health. And it's not just what your DNA brings with it. It's not just the individual biology, but it's how that individual biology interacts in the context of close relationships, and then more distant relationships. How is this information changing the way that you and others who are working with children are treating them? What have we learned recently? We've learned so much about what high quality care means. And I'm going to specifically talk about high quality health care, but this applies, really, to all the different environments in which young children and their families are. When we think about what we need to know in order to promote optimal development and well being in children, we have to ask questions not only about how they were growing, or how things are going at home. We need to understand much more deeply how well their caregivers are doing, how they are exposed or not exposed to different stressors, and, really importantly, what supports and resources they have that promote development. 

We have some particular challenges here in Colorado. Childhood poverty is high. 15% of all children are living in poverty. That ties Colorado for number five, I believe, in the list of child poverty states across the country. Do you think there is a relationship between poverty and the kind of work that you are trying to address here? 

We know that `adversity` does not discriminate by income. And we also know that children who are living in poverty are particularly vulnerable to stressful experiences in their environments, and also have limited access to the resources and supports that would help them actually overcome the impact of that adversity. And so when we think about poverty and we think about designing systems of care that can address and support and-- getting back to our DNA-- actually modify experiences that put children in danger. We have to be able to understand what poverty looks like and what it's a proxy for. 

What do you mean by a proxy? 

When we talk about poverty, we are talking about a group of individuals who have differential access to the things that we need in order to live our lives. And this is everything from basic needs. So things like food insecurity, or housing instability dramatically impact child well being. This film, "DNA is not Destiny," shows us that the impacts of poverty and these other issues are really much greater than we might have imagined in the first place. It's not just the poverty. It's not just the stress. It's the changes on the child's body. What can we do? 

I think one of the incredible pieces of the film was being able to demonstrate the differences in the care giving environment when there were and weren't supports. And that is an area where we can all, actually, have an impact. When we start asking families about their experiences and understanding the circumstances under which they are raising their children, and can offer them resources and suggestions and even just a place to talk about the experience of what's happening, we are qualitatively changing the caregiver's capacity to be the kind of caregiver that that child needs, even under circumstances of `adversity`. 

Have you seen examples of this kind of thing changing people's lives? Are there any things you can tell us about? 

We provide groups for parents or other family members, other caregivers, and their babies. And then in these groups, families come together. When families can connect, and feel heard, and feel that their systems of care, in this case, the health care system, understand their circumstances, the health outcomes of those babies, who then turn into children, are much better. 

And you've seen greater outcomes, more positive outcomes, for the children who participate in this versus children who don't? Or are you looking at versus the whole? 

So I think what we can do right now, we have lots of research and evidence that shows that the kind of early intervention that focuses on the caregiving relationship in situations where there's tremendous adversity and environmental stress, those interventions are effective. We have a very large literature that says that. 

The film talks about the effect of enriched environments and good nutrition, all kinds of things that are coming together at once. So it's not just one thing or the other thing. It's the combination of things? 

Absolutely. So we know that when we think about the circumstances under which parents are caregiving, and particularly parents who are living in poverty, and don't have access to the same resources, it often isn't one thing. When we ask families that we see in primary care what's hard, and what's gone well, we get a whole `constellation` of factors that contribute to the difficulty. Once you're worried about not having enough food on the table, or not knowing where you're going to be able to put your baby down for a nap, or not having access to high quality child care so that you can go to work, those worries `cascade` and become a bundle of stress and worry that then directly impacts that caregiver's ability to interact with that baby. 

Dr. Ayelet Talmi, thank you very much for being with us. 

Thank you. 

Now I'd like to turn to Dr. Desmond Runyan who is the Jack and Vicki Thompson professor of Pediatrics at the University of Colorado, and the Executive Director of the Kemp Center for the prevention and treatment of child abuse and `neglect`. Dr. Runyan has researched child abuse for more than three decades and also helped us, previously, understand some of the issues in another `installment` of this documentary series called Raising of America. Thank you for joining us again. 

Glad to be here. 

Thank you. Dr. Runyan, what is the connection between stress and disease, not only in children but as they grow into adulthood? 

So stress is a term that was invented, I believe, in the early '50s by Hans Selye to describe exposure that gets your system `revved`. 

Really? We've only had stress since the 1950s? 

I suspect we had it before. We just didn't call it that. But Dr. Selye described stress as a-- he coined the term to describe this process of your system being revved up, that your hormones, particularly `epinephrine`, going, your cortisol going. And it's called the Flight or Fight response, that when you're scared, you are either prepared to run or you're prepared to fight. And presumably we've had it since `the dawn of human life`, because we needed to run away from saber toothed tigers. 

We've seen some-- and it was mentioned in this documentary-- certain diseases are now being connected to stress, this whole idea of `methylation`. How new is that idea? 

Well, I went to medical school in the '70s. And we didn't talk about methylation back then. So this is all really new stuff, and that's really exciting and very helpful for understanding what's going on. Dr. Vince Felitti is a preventive medicine physician that worked for Kaiser Permanente in Southern California, who first started doing these studies on `adverse childhood experiences`. The ACE study, we heard about it in the documentary. And his goal was to try and understand in adults, who he was seeing in a preventive medicine clinic, what the relationship was between those earlier experiences that the adults had had as children, and their subsequent diseases, and has described all the diseases. And there are lots of them, including suicide risk and mental health things, but also physical health-- heart disease, pancreatic cancer have all been linked in different ways to adverse childhood experiences. 

And the ACE study says as the number of those adverse experiences goes up, so does the incidence of disease? 

Yes, Dr. Felitti summarized the child sexual abuse, and physical abuse, and neglect, but also a parent in jail, drug use in the home. And actually I don't keep in the top my head all, I think, 12 different types of adverse childhood experiences that have been described or categorized. And four more of those types of experiences are related to a lot of health conditions, including heart disease. 

Heart disease you brought up. I believe it's the number one killer of adults in the United States. Is that right? 

Yes, it is. 

And so to the idea that the number one killer of adults in the United States can be somehow, in some cases, related to stress experience as children is quite an amazing thing to say. And the fact that it's not a death sentence either, things can be done about this. You have been participating in a study that's gone on for a number of years, the long scan study, looking at some of these similar things. What are you finding through that study? 

So our long scan study was in five states, and it's a longitudinal study of children who in the first four years of life were either at risk for `maltreatment` or reported for maltreatment. And about 66% were actually reported for maltreatment, and most of those `substantiated`. But we followed those children, and now they're adults in their 20s. They collectively, those 1,300 children, have had more than 8,000 reports of maltreatment since then, some other `substantiated`, some of them not substantiated, in the sense of the normal DSS investigation. Those children are now, as young adults, we're looking at their increased risk for criminal behavior, for drug use, for mental health disorders, depression, anxiety. And all of those things are true. But the other side of the coin is that a remarkably high percentage of them are actually doing pretty well. 

We saw in this documentary that what they call the `epigenetic` change can be `reversed`. Is that what you're seeing from some of these cases? 

That's really an important point. One of the concerns that some of my scientific colleagues have had about the discussion about the brain changes and the changes in the genes from being exposed to violence, I mean, one take home lesson if you're not careful would be, well, those people are damaged. We can't do anything about them. Let's move on and help somebody else. And just maybe for society's sake, we need to lock them up or something. And that's far from the truth. The real answer is that many of those children can be helped. Early is better than late. Young childhood is really important. I have a colleague who adopted two children from Africa, and he got them at age 8 and 10. And they've had lifelong problems since then, although interestingly, the 10 year-olds doing better than the 8-year-old in terms of the changes, but it turns out that `sexual trafficking` and the violence that they experienced early in children have been difficult to reverse in a very loving home that's been very supportive and have brought every service that they can for these kids. 

Does it matter when the experience happens in a child's development? 

It probably matters differently by different experiences. When we looked at which kinds of experiences seem to be most correlated with different kinds of things, neglect was related to `aggression`. Neglect in the first two years of life was related to aggression at age 10 and 12 and 16. But witnessing domestic violence had more anxiety and depression if you witnessed it at four, six, or eight. `Psychological` maltreatment of children was much more damaging at 12. Being called names, and stupid, and `dumb`, and ugly, and other adverse terms really were destructive for 12 year-olds. And physical and sexual abuse have emerged as among the most important adverse experiences at age 14 and 16. So while all these different things are bad for you, we know as `pediatricians` that development makes a difference. And if you're prepared and can understand what's going on, you're in a much better position to `bounce back` from it than if you're not old enough or wise enough to understand what's going on. 

And is this evolving understanding changing the way we treat these children? 

I think we've been treating children with that kind of sensitivity to their `traumas` for a long time, and that's what we specialize in at Kemp Center since Henry Kemp founded it back in the '70s. So that's been a part of what we're doing. But the astounding thing about our society, we have $30 billion a year spent on medical research. And less than 30 million is spent on any kind of child abuse research, and less than half of that is probably where child abuse is the point of the research. And so in a country that's spending 30 billion on medical research, we're spending an astonishingly small amount of money to try and understand a problem that gets reported six million times a year. 

Do you think that we'll begin to change as we begin to understand this evolving research? In other words, if we are spending millions and billions of dollars treating health conditions that we now understand might be impacted through the kind of work that you're talking about by treating children for their early trauma, that seems like a successful investment that could save society money in the long run. Is that right? 

You've convinced me. It's makes a lot of sense. From my perspective, I mean, getting the heart, lung, and blood people, and the National Cancer Institute, and those organizations which have funded great research on other parts of `the causal chain` on how you get to cancer or heart disease, having them pay attention to this would be a really important step. And I think one of the things is to call on this and increased research to understand and help counter the bad effects of adverse childhood experiences. 

What about for the rest of us? What should we be doing? What should we be looking at, looking out for? What are the signs of child abuse or the signs that a child may be in trouble that we could help keep an eye out for? 

So it's different by age, but there are certain kinds of `sentinel` injuries. I mean, children who aren't walking don't get `bruises`. So if you see an infant who's not yet walking who's bruised, then somebody has done something to that child. That's the first. I mean, maybe they've fallen, but you need to be thinking about a non-walking child with bruises, you have to say how did that happen? That may need to be investigated. Certain kinds of bruises in older children are more suspicious than others. There probably isn't a four-year-old in the country who hasn't had a forehead bruised, or a shin bruised, or a knee bruised. That's not particularly important. However, bruising on a soft, `squishy` part of the body like your buttocks, or your cheek, or the middle of your belly, bruises there are very `worrisome`. So those are physical signs. Also paying attention to the child's well being in terms of are they happy or sad, and trying to understand a child who's eight, nine, or 10 who's expressing suicidal ideation is pretty remarkable. 

What about the adults? What should we be on the lookout for for those who are doing the maltreatment? 

That's harder to figure out. Henry Kempe, who founded the center here in Denver so many years ago and Brandt Steele, his psychiatrist, said that if you put a group of parents who were `perpetrators` in a room with cocktail glasses, it'd look like any other cocktail room in America. We do know is that single parents, because they presumably don't have the support and somebody else who they can hand the child off to, use harsh punishment at a little bit higher rate. We know that poverty is related. We know that education is related. But there are plenty of two parent families with high education-- doctors, lawyers, professionals-- who've `maltreated` their children. So it's not easy to see from the outside. So it's the child that's the victim. If you see a child you're concerned about, the fact that the parents are both doctors, and well often, and live in a nice neighborhood doesn't mean that that child's safe. Stress knows no boundaries. Exactly. In that case. And there is a place for people to call if they suspect this or know of a family who needs some help. The statewide hotline, child abuse hotline. We'll put that up. It's 844-CO-4-KIDS. That's C-O, as in Colorado, the number 4, kids, or 1844-264-5437. Dr. Runyan, thank you for sharing in this important conversation, and thank you for joining us.
