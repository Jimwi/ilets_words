A Hotline for People Having Religious Doubts 

WEBVTT Kind: captions Language: en 

We know becoming an `atheist` rarely happens overnight. It happens as the result of a lot of `introspection` or conversations with trusted friends. But, what happens when you don't have anyone to talk to? What if you're a churchgoer who just doesn't have a lot of non-religious friends? What if you live in the Bible Belt? What if you're a teenager whose parents are super religious? What if you're a `pastor`? It's so important to have a sounding board when you start to have these doubts. Because, it turns out there are some questions Google can't answer. And there's finally a solution for this. It's called the Hotline Project. It's basically a phone number you can call, `confidentially`, if you're ever having a crisis of faith, or you have questions about religion. They're not there to help you become an `atheist`, by the way. The trained volunteers are there to help you work through your questions and doubts honestly, in a way that pastors never could, because being an atheist is never an okay option for them. And if you're not ready to shed your faith yet, that's fine, too. They're not here to debate with you, and it's not like there's some white board with tally marks every time they score a deconversion. If needed, they'll give you `relevant` `referrals` to groups that can help you more directly. And that includes the Therapy Project where you can get in touch with `secular` `counselors`. This hotline just started up. They're available anytime on weekends and during the evenings on weekdays. The number is 184 I-DOUBT-IT. That's 1-844-368-2848. I know when I was younger, this would have been an incredible resource. And even though there are so many options online these days, there's nothing like talking to another human being one-on-one. So if you're `scared` about these thoughts that you're having and the bible doesn't make as much sense to you anymore, and you have this sudden `urge` to scream: "`Citation` needed!" at everything your pastor says, give the Hotline Project a call. There's more information down below. My name is Hemant Mehta and I write at FriendlyAtheist.com What do you want to see a video about?
