Scottish ‘Highland Tiger’ wildcat more endangered than Asian cousin - BBC

The Scottish wildcat. What it lacks in size, it makes up for in `ferocity`. Nicknamed the Highland Tiger, this cat is even more endangered than its `striped` Asian cousin. 

This is not a domestic cat that has gone wild - this is a truly wild animal that moved in here shortly after the glaciers left Britain. Unfortunately, it really is in trouble. Its range has contracted massively from once having covered the whole of Britain, to just parts of the Scottish Highlands. But the real problem that the wildcat faces is because it's quite closely related genetically to the domestic cat, it can actually `interbreed` and produce fertile hybrids. And this is a real problem, because with each passing generation, the wildcat is becoming more and more `diluted`, and less and less distinctive of that native animal that we've had for so, so long in Scotland. 

A coordinated conservation effort has set up Scottish Wildcat Action. It's the first national effort to protect the cats in the wild, and has established a conservation `breeding` programme. Douglas Richardson is head of Living Collections at the Highland Wildlife Park. 

I firmly believe that a healthy captive population of Scotti sh wildcats in high quality environments will be crucial to the survival of the species. At the very least, that safety net role that they play. Someone alluded to... captive breeding programmes are like lifeboats on an ocean liner. You hope you never have to use one, but it's nice to know that they're there. 

Captive-bred wildcats like 11-year-old Hamish are being exchanged between parks to mate with genetically strong females to secure the future bloodline. Today, Hamish is being loaned to the Aigas Field Centre near Inverness, in the hope that he'll breed with one of their female wildcats. 

Hello, what's all this? What's this? He's quite a character, he's not at all dangerous. Though, saying that, I wouldn't want him to land on the top of my head. He's very good with females, and he's excellent with his offspring. I've actually seen him carrying and cleaning his kittens on occasion. If Hamish and his female companions are successful, their descendants may eventually be released back into the Highlands, but only into protected areas. I want to get that captive programme to a level that, if it all goes `belly-up` as far as the wild population is concerned, we still have that cushion. It's not just about captive breeding in some of these `facilities` - it's about education and raising awareness - making people aware that we have this fantastic animal living in the wild and it dose need our help.
